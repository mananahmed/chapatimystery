  content: "[...] And conveying wrong impressions to Pakistanis is not the only place
    where it makes poor political sense. The lack of religious freedom is a problem
    in Pakistan &#8212; where minorities live in constant fear of blasphemy laws and
    official discrimination. For many Indians (including this blogger), Jizya (or
    Jaziya), the religious tax which Islamic rulers imposed on their non-Muslim subjects
    was something to be found in the history books. As Amit Varma discovered during
    his Pakistan trip, it still exists today. The plight of those Pakistanis, so often
    citizens belonging to its religious minorities, who are charged under blasphemy
    laws is more well-known. The government of Pakistan&#8217;s Punjab province, under
    Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi has made attempts to reach out to the Sikhs,
    but by and large, the picture remains one of religious intolerance. High-profile
    visits to Hindu and Sikh places of worship by Indian leaders gives the Pakistani
    government an opportunity to show off its &#8216;tolerance&#8217; to the international
    media. It is unclear why the Indian prime minister and the Opposition leader have
    to provide celebrity endorsement to Pakistan&#8217;s dubious product. [...]"

  content: "Dear Brother and Sister's   Blessing and Greetings: 
                Meeting the Challenges of Christian Life in Pakistan  In Pakistan,
    being a Christian is not an easy life. It is a life filled with much sorrow and
    bitterness. It is a life that leaves much to be desired, and sees very little
    needs fulfilled. Discrimination is the order of the day. It's an order that forces
    most Jesus-loving souls from their homes and into a sort of virtual slavery. Christians
    work hard labor jobs as sweepers, sanitation workers and brick makers from sunup
    to sundown. Their wages are almost non-existent. Entire families earn less money
    in a month's time than most workers in the United States make in a day, or even
    an hour. The work is also very primitive, lacking machines and back saving technologies
    that other countries have ridden to success and fortune. Most of the work here
    is still done by hand using rudimentary tools. The hours are long, and the work
    is hard, and the pay makes it seem like a literal death sentence. Discrimination,
    has also led to their abject humiliation, and forced many of these dear people
    into homelessness. Religious fundamentalists, acting in rage, attacked and destroyed
    many Christian owned homes and businesses, leaving them without a shred of shelter
    or possessions. The Christian people watched helplessly as their homes were looted,
    all of their family valuables, and keepsakes taken, burned, smashed and destroyed
    before their very eyes. In a mere instant, they were turned into homeless vagabonds
    with no place to turn; no place to lay their heads at night. A dire sense of fear
    and hopelessness fell upon their hearts and minds. After the attacks, many villagers
    found that the water wells they drew from were smashed and left utterly useless.
    No Homes, no water and also no way to rebuild, as most of them were already so
    deeply in debt that they begin to believe that there is no hope left. For Christians
    in Pakistan, non-educated and poor, good jobs are only a dream, and most of them
    cannot afford to start their own businesses.   To compound matters
    greatly, a large number of these poor people are in debt. Their creditors are
    their employers, so quitting and trying to find a better job is not a practical
    solution. One might think that those who are poor should not borrow money for
    things they cannot afford, but that simply is not the case here. These poor people
    are caught in a viscous cycle that has consumed their lives for what has to seem
    like an eternity. They work so hard that their bodies ache, break, and wear out
    at an early age. They have to seek medical attention to ease the suffering, and
    the bills are high to them. They have no money to pay the doctors, so their employers
    step in to make the payments. The initial bill is only about $80.00 American Dollars,
    but it quickly goes far beyond their reach to pay with interest added by the employer.
    They are hard workers, but the work is hard too. So hard in fact that many cannot
    meet the required workload due to ailing, tired, worn out bodies.  The people,
    deeply in debt, struggle to make the payments and earn enough to buy food. Many
    times they cannot make the payments, and it angers the creditors. They then make
    legal demands that the rest of the family is responsible for the debt, forcing
    small children into a life of hard labor as soon as they are old enough to be
    of much good. The children are thrown into this hard days labor with no chance
    of an education, or a Better Way of Life. Many small children suffer because the
    adults who would give them care are working in the factories and the houses of
    the rich. Children are left to fend for themselves, rummaging through the streets
    like wild animals. The elderly are sick and disabled, and have difficulties taking
    care of the small children.    Thankfully, things are changing for the
    betterment of the Christians in Pakistan. The Pakistani Government has begun setting
    and enforcing laws to protect the rights of Christians. After several terrorist
    attacks against humanity that were called `Religious Hate Crimes', the Pakistani
    Government vowed it would tolerate no more attacks of these kinds. With these
    new laws and the help of generous volunteers willing to give time and money, we,
    the Thirst of Holy Spirit Ministries are certain that we can help to restore these
    poor Christian people to a better life than they have ever known. Please know
    that we are not trying to establish a welfare system, but we are trying to extend
    a helping hand to those who desperately need it. After they are able to stand
    on their own two feet, they will be able to fully do for themselves the things
    they were once able to do. We are working to see a strong Christian population,
    ready to serve God and live their lives in a manner becoming the Bible.    Thirst
    of Holy Spirit Ministries in Pakistan wants to help to educate the young children
    in reading, writing and arithmetic. We want to see them grow up educated and ready
    to face any challenge life may throw their way. We also want to see their parents
    and the elderly benefit from the Holy Scriptures being read in their homes to
    give them strength and courage to face the day. We are confident that we can return
    pride back to those who have lost everything, just because they long to serve
    Jesus Christ. Amen. With humble prayers and regards, Yours in Jesus Christ, Please
    Donate us. Contact us. Ev. Qaisar Anwar Christian Colony Toba Tek Singh

<p>Tough day today, I must say. You have Ashcroft's Seven Deadly Agents roaming the streets of US, you have Abu Hamza in London looking like an evil <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3752517.stm">Captain Hook</a>. And then you have the case of Samuel Masih in Lahore. I found out about it from an <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_27-5-2004_pg3_1">editorial</a> in the Daily Times:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">A Lahore Christian of unsound mind was accused of blasphemy by the narrow-minded among us and sent to police custody. He was in a lockup when it was discovered that his general health was poor and in fact he could die while in custody. A scared SHO had him examined by a doctor who advised that Samuel Masih was in an advanced stage of tuberculosis. He was at once removed to a hospital. Then the unspeakable happened. The police constable on duty at the hospital "discovered" that Samuel was a blasphemer. He went up to his bed and smashed his head in with a steel bar.<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Horrific. The charge of blasphemy is brought by gentleman who saw him spit on a mosque's wall. SPIT!<br />
<b>update</b>: Samuel Masih <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_29-5-2004_pg1_3">died</a> from his injuries in the hospital on May 29th, 2004.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Now, the Federal Sharia Court as has only upheld <i>Hadd</i> decisions in 2 cases [theft] which were overruled by the Supreme Court. Hence, it is fairly certain that this case will also get dismissed. But what to say about the attack? A mis-guided sipahi who has been trained at the Pavlovian level to hate Christians, Hindus has no rational ability to judge the veracity or strength of any claim of against The Prophet? He hears only that <i>Tauheen-i Risalat</i>  was commited by someone and he reacts as he has been conditioned to: with violence.<br />
And blasphemy is not the only sword of Damocles hanging over the Christian community. In another case, Pastor Samuels and his family has been charged under the Shari'a Law for inciting a Muslim woman to marry a Christian. I am not sure about the details of <a href="http://www.pakcyber.com/pcp/newsdetails.php?newsid=475">this case</a>, but it revolves a Muslim woman who began a love affair with this Christian. A no-no. As the injuctions in Shari'a against a Muslim woman marrying a Christian (or other People of the Book) is much more severe compared to the relative laxity in the case of a Muslim man marrying a Christian woman.<br />
And lest we stray into thinking that the persecution is only against Christians and only in Pakistan, this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3732343.stm">recent case in India</a> of the tribulations of a Hindu woman and a Muslim man should dispel those notions.<br />
Regardless, this HAS to change. Pakistan has to modify it's school curriculum. It has to change the rhetoric of the Mullah. It has to guarantee equal rights to all citizens. The <i>Hudood Ordinances</i> instituted under Gen. Zia-ul Haq have got to be re-evaluated. I am glad at least <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_26-5-2004_pg7_41">one other person</a> thinks so....</p>
