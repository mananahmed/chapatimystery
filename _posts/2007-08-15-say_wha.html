  content: "I agree!  Guha's article made me uneasy and nauseous not because his hero
    is Nehru (who left a legacy of corruption and obtaining political power at every
    cost), but because he does not have any point.  When I read the title of the article,
    I thought here is another article about some  writer's personal, internal, literal
    partition into two beings: (1) the Indian who feels guilty about hating Muslims
    (but  doesn't know why he hates them) or (2) the Indian who feels that  India
    has two faces (public face that idealizes the Western sense of economy and the
    private face where we are taught to  hate at home).  Guah's article is a superficial,
    thoughtless monologue about some dream he had.  What's more offensive is that
    it portrays educated, upper-class, privileged Hindus as being good and secular
    at heart, but the Muslims just don't know it because all the unconventionally
    thinking Hindus are in the West.  Just what the hell is he saying!?!  Is he saying
    that he had not met Tariq Banuri in the States, he would not have considered being
    friends with a Muslim?  Even with all the technological development in India,
    the reality is that Indians must go abroad to form meaningful and lasting  alliances
    with Muslims or Pakistanis.  Is this progress for India?  Guah's enlightening
    dream is out-of-date and unrelated to the 60 years of Indian independence; because
    Indians have yet to think independently of their social order, caste, class, and
    sexism.  One would be a fool to think that Guah's article presents an idea at
    all.  It is a goof!  His article is a filler for the NYT.  Shame on you NYT!  Why
    couldn't you have asked Pankaj Mishra to write something?  Or, me?"

    That is, the line of demarcation that created Pakistan is assumed to be a division
    of India. Pakistan's existence is, somehow, an illegitimate compromise. It is
    remarkable that he acknowledges the discrimination against Muslims within India
    and, yet, believes that Pakistan is legitimately only a part of the larger India.

    totally sounds like he's on drugs.  and really, what does it say about secular
    india and its wonderful diversity that his first muslim friend was tariq banuri.
    \ The article should have been called  'i dream of tariq', really.  at least that
    would have justified/explained its rambling incoherence a little ...  And
    while we're on the subject of who gets to write these things, I'm really sick
    of reading the asinine analyses on all things Pakistan that Kamila Shamsie and
    Mohsin Hamid produce. It's as if these are the only English-speaking Pakistanis
    that the NYT and the Guardian can find."

    for an op-ed this week?? I don't think they'd publish anything of this caliber
    on, say, US race relations, or gender relations. It also seemed to contrast the
    interesting story about the new high school poli sci curriculum that ran on p.4(ish)
    of the front section. In any case, their editorial judgement is clearly limited
    when it comes to S.Asia.

  content: "You know, I feel sort of uneasy about everyone attacking this piece. I
    DO agree with you folks who are wondering how in the world it got published in
    the NYT (Guha's piece seemed to be more appropriate for a blog post rather than
    a national newspaper). It would have been better if they had published a piece
    that was more critical and discussed things from a framework different from the
    one we come across all the time.  However, the writer is being honest, he
    is highlighting the contradictions of an India that is a supposedly secular state,
    his OWN internal contradictions, and what I see as the internal partitions he
    has in his OWN head. I actually think it takes a lot to publicly admit your own
    prejudices and so on. This isn't too far from what Pankaj Mishra wrote in his
    essay \"Jihadis\"- that when he was in Pakistan, he felt like he was surrounded
    by a bunch of fundamentalists. Obviously, these prejudices and internal partitions
    are irrational, incorrect, and not true, but there are MILLIONS of people who
    think this way- people who are not  assholes per se and may even be well intentioned.
    Because of this, I think it's good that we are exposed to these kinds of opinions,
    if only to know what the thoughts are like so that we can argue against them.  I'd
    rather that a writer be honest about what he/she thinks rather than always putting
    up a \"politically correct\" front which doesn't always reflect/correspond to
    what they are thinking internally.   I hope no one rolls their eyes when
    they read this and think, \"Oh god, she's an apologist for Guha, the NYT, etc..\""

    is, somehow, an illegitimate compromise. It is remarkable that he acknowledges
    the discrimination against Muslims within India and, yet, believes that Pakistan
    is legitimately only a part of the larger India.\"  Where on earth do you
    see this what you have stated above? Guha said:  \"Despite their shared
    culture, cuisine and love for the game of cricket, India and Pakistan have already
    fought four wars. And judging by the number of troops on their borders and the
    missiles and nuclear weapons to back them, they seem prepared to fight a fifth.\"  India
    and Pakistan DO have some shared cultures, and to point that out is NOT \"de-legitimizing\"
    Pakistan's existence and claiming that Pakistan is part of a greater India. There
    are Punjabis on both sides of the border, Sindhis on both sides, Gujaratis on
    both sides, etc who share the same language, food, and so on. If we were to follow
    your logic, then that means there are Pakistanis themselves who do not see Pakistan's
    existence as \"legitimate\" and a part of greater India, such as Asma Jahangir
    from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan when she says:  \"Pakistan
    and India share a common culture and have been separated by politicians for their
    own private ends for too long.\"  http://www.hrcp-web.org/indopak_People.cfm  Guha
    pointing this out and then taking note of the fact that Pakistan and India have
    fought wars, are nuclear states, and will probably fight more wars in the future
    is not incorrect or imprecise."

  content: "I thought Guha's was a bizarre and rather pointless editorial; however
    I must confess that some of the reactions in this thread seem to me to border
    on hysteria.  As far as I can tell he is holding up HIS OWN experience and feelings
    as a demonstration of the contradictions of secular India (or perhaps a contradiction
    between rhetoric and practice) -- Pakistan is actually quite incidental to his
    piece (the \"divide\", of course, isn't), I read him as more concerned with what
    it says \"about\" India.  Ralph Luker: having read other works by Guha,
    I do think he is \"anti-partition\"; however, your comment seems to assume that
    the only reason for being anti-partition is because of an exaltation of \"Greater
    India\"/\"Akhand Bharat\".  I resist that implicit assumption: my own reading
    of Guha's views is that he views \"the idea of India\" -- i.e. the Nehruvian idea
    of India -- as an inherently less problematic idea on which to found a polity
    than \"the idea of Pakistan.\"  That is, recognizing that all nationalisms are
    problematic, I read his claim being that not all are EQUALLY problematic, and
    thus one need not accept the \"given-ness\" of \"Greater India\" to be opposed
    to the \"idea of Pakistan.\""

    I had in mind the dream part when I wrote that. I don't usually expect reading
    about dreams in the NYT...but then again, the NYT has a habit of publishing things

    I think he focuses too much on Nehru (but he was also working on a Nehru biography
    at the same time, if I'm not wrong). Actually, I'm sort of tired of reading about
    the lives of the \"fathers of the nation,\" which brings me to the next point:  \"I
    just got the new Guha book (&rdquo;India After Gandhi&rdquo;);
    haven't read it yet, but was wondering if anyone here has?

    probably won't read it. I've been Gandhi'ed out all my life, and I stopped after
    I read his autobiography, which was in 2004.  Do tell us if Guha's book
    discusses Gandhi at length.  Hey, has anybody read Eqbal Ahmed's selected

    refugees from Lahore) - and it's fair enough to point to the ways in which partition
    left Indians screwed up. If only he had done so more coherently.  I just
    got his India after Gandhi book as well, and though he used to go on and on about
    how Indian history needs to tackle more recent issues and not be so obsessed with
    the colonial era, a good chunk of the book actually deals with the immediate aftermath
    of independence. Thus far I find it well researched and written smoothly enough
    (though he's not a talented, lyrical writer), but what really disappoints me is
    that he seems to have a fairly conventional nationalist angle on history and historiography
    (though mercifully doesn't get on the whole Mahatma-worship track). I expected
    more of him."

    will they discover my hinduness and behead me in front of badshahi masjid, oh
    no they wont because im secular\" schizophrenia must have something to do with
    partition.  Though i prefer my landlord's version: raised in pre-partition amritsar,
    though not panjabi, on my first day in the flat told me i have a 'muhammadan beard'(i
    dont), that my 'muhammadan girlfriend' must be very attractive and then went on
    some rant about how Lahore was a beautiful city when the hindus owned it, but
    now  it must be very dirty.  then told me some charming 1947 Earth type story
    about Ali bhai, his college best friend who fled during partition and whose stuff
    he safeguarded, who i must find when i go to lahore.  This is at least a reflection
    of a man who experienced these events, whose life and relationships were torn
    apart by partition, in whatever way.  Guha's however, is the reason why
    those fighting against hindu nationalism are termed \"pseudo secular.\""

    people further into radically different spheres of habitation and commerce.  This
    has very important consequences, particularly on the Muslim sections of the city,
    which especially in north India, have become little more than ghettos.  Its
    stupid to expect the secular elite to care about these things, they'd rather pat
