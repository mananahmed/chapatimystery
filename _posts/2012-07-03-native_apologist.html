  content: "Salman,  And presumably the native expert of \"colonialism/imperialism\"
    are without pre-judiced providing a fair and balanced portrait in this blog without
    any mention any fratricidal murder or killing taking in the name of sectarianisms
    but THE important part is imperialist drones! Its a different matter that they
    except silver pieces thrown by those imperialist taxes as part of university tenures,
    grants, aids etc. you know these guys are doing a favor by holding a mirror to
    Imperialism in the mirror!  Janaab doosron pe kichad uchalnen se pahle apni
    gareban mein jhaak lein to bahut achcha hoga. Hammam mein sab nange hain  Khuda-hafiz."

  content: "Dear Anurag,  On the \"killing taking in the name of sectarianisms,\"
    you can check out this search {{site.baseurl}}?s=Ahmadi to see the
    many CM posts, or this series: {{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/dominance_without_toleration_iii_guns_roses.html
    And, this link ({{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/an_abandoned_man.html)
    will take you to my essay on that.  Btw, that search feature actually works.
    You should try it sometime, or visit the archives, and see the \"portrait in this
    blog without any mention any fratricidal murder or killing taking in the name
    of sectarianisms.\" However, I understand that it is easier to just leave an asinine
    comment."

<p>A snippet from my <a href="http://www.sunday-guardian.com/bookbeat/apologia-for-imperialism-in-the-voice-of-a-good-muslim">review</a> of Irfan Husain's <em>Fatal Faultlines: Pakistan, Islam and the West:</em></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://orientalismisalive.tumblr.com/post/21035247823/the-weekly-bernard-lewis-award-it-takes-a-lot-of"><img class="alignleft" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2fmfx6Zas1rtbojto1_400.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="179" /></a>The Global War on Terror has spawned a cottage industry of commentators and "experts," who simply repackage the American public's commonly held beliefs and serve it back to them: The Muslims are crazy, they hate America (and each other), and America is a force for good. Husain primarily posits himself as an internal critic of Islam, but also offers some tepid critiques of the US. This double maneuver gives him more credibility with his readers: He is fair and balanced. Suspended outside the context of power-relations, such "balance" serves to efface the violence that is imperialism. Besides, who better to provide apologia for the American Empire than an "authentic," Muslim voice? Since the US has the largest military in the world, "it is inevitable that it has assumed the role of world policeman." "Its economic and financial interests are so far-flung that it needs to maintain a global military presence." The cop, however, is hated even by law-abiding citizens. (p54) Empire is thus America's cross to bear for "mankind's progress" â€” the White man's burden for the 21st century, if you will.</p>
