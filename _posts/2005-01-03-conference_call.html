    \n\nOn the other hand, I am *organizing* a conference on South Asian Secularism
    to be held in December... Guess I'll be busy after all. (Consider giving a paper?
    More details soon)"

<p><img src="/img/seattle.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Welcome to 2005, gentle readers. I hope all of you had a nice break. I sure did. The break from CM was nice; though, I must admit that I cheated on all of you and posted elsewhere a few times. But, I swear I was thinking about you the whole time. We will get back into the swing of things very soon. Until then, enjoy the potpourri below.</p>
<p>The beginning of this new year is all about conferences. First up is the <a href="http://www.historians.org/">American Historical Association</a>. I am going to Seattle this weekend for it. I am not presenting but I may have an interview or two. No one knows as of yet. I am not terribly excited about it, but my excitement level can rise after a few pints. Any readers in Seattle? Next, will be South Asia conference at Berkeley in mid-Feb. I will be presenting there and that paper needs to be, uh, written. Right after that, I am involved in a conference right here on Uchicago campus on the study of the non-West in the academy. Paper needs to be written. After that, in March, is a possible meeting of the American Oriental Society in Philadelphia. Paper will need to be written for that as well. I already cancelled a trip to Hawaii [HAWAII!!!] where I was presenting on a polisci panel on nationalism. I just can't take all that, really. Even more: a couple of conferences on campus on the legacy of Bernard Cohn and the aftermath of colonialism (yeah, that). Will have to attend those in March as well.</p>
<p>I don't like conferences. </p>
<p>Now, a few editorial notes. The <a href="/subaltern/index.php">subaltern</a> is dead. I just cannot keep up with the man. Instead of conquering Punjaub, he wrote in his journal 2, 3 times a day. Back to history's dustbin for you, Mr. subaltern. I will replace that space, I think, with selections from primary texts as I come across them. Largely from imperial writings, whether Arab imperialists in the 8th century or Scottish imperialists from the 17th. Look for that.<br />
I have added a few more blogs on the right. Do visit them. Anand wants to bike from <a href="http://synchroni-cities.blogspot.com/2004/10/cycling-from-kabul-to-kolkata.html">Kabul to Kolkata</a>. If he makes out of the baray-bazaar in Peshawar with his bike, I will salute him [maybe he should go from kolkata to kabul?]. Support him, please. Claire wants to do nothing but write about the progress of her <a href="http://chlgeorge.blogspot.com/2005/01/phd.html">phd</a>. Please support her. Also, <a href="http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/">Sharon</a> is going to start a History Carnival - which is a virtual orgy of historians and their texts. All interested historians please contact her. Through Zack, I learned that CM is nominated for <a href="http://pub2.bravenet.com/vote/vote.php?usernum=131619791&cpv=2">Best Pakistani Blog</a>. Hmmm. Anyways, this being the last day of voting, I just wanna thank those who voted for me. I do appreciate it. A penultimate note here is the emergence in the blogging world of <a href="http://maujkar.blogspot.com/">sonee</a> - who will show the world his unstoppable bowling technique coupled with his unstoppable finding water underground technique.</p>
<p>Finally, one of my red-hot post on <a href="/archives/better_with_tablas/ra_da_punjabi_rapper.html">Ra Da Punjabi Rapper</a> just got updated. I will be interviewing Bohemia on my trip to West Coast. I cannot wait to talk, in Punjabi, language, ethnicity, and how damn good it feels to be a gangsta with Bohemia. Maybe I should see if one of those internet dailies (salon, slate etc.) wanna pick up my piece.</p>
