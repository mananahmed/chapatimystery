<p>For crying out loud. <i>Hadh hoti hay</i>. Our mango republic, ran by the Dictator Formerly Known As The General, has lost its mind. </p>
<p>I have often highlighted the reports and writings of <a href="http://www.nicholasschmidle.com/">Nicholas Schmidle</a>, a freelance journalist, reporting from Pakistan on numerous occasions. I have often exchanged emails with him. He was, contra majority, writing, researching and engaging directly with the turmoil gripping that nation. Something that I admired and respected in him.</p>
<p>I say "was" because he was deported from the country by the government, Steve Clemons <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/002700.php">reported</a> today. [thanks e.]</p>
<p>His sin, according to Clemons, may be that his recent piece in the NYT magazine, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06PAKISTAN-t.html?ex=1357189200&en=f3244979ea1cd975&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Next Gen Taliban</a> was deemed offensive. </p>
<p>I can, off the top of my head, list a thousand things more offensive in Pakistan at this moment. Schmidle's piece doesn't make the list. </p>
<p>I am too angry to really pretend having that academic distance my gentle readers expect from me. </p>
