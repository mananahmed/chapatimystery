  content: It is so sad a situition. Ahmadi's ,whatever state edict passed against
    them by ZAB govt. under pressure from Mullah and Mufti alike, are generally some
    of the finest and well educated people in Pakistan. Some of  best friends I made
    at King Edward Medical college(decades ago) are Ahmadis, very cultured and non-violent
    ,very humane. It would have been best if some judgements were left to the creator
    Himself. May the dead RIP, and the wounded have a speedy recovery.

  content: "The Pakistani state can do two simple things to start. Declare Sunday
    as a national day of mourning, and arrange for the President and the P.M. and
    his entire cabinet to attend a \"gha'ibana namaaz-i-janaaza\" (i.e. a public prayer,
    without the presence of the coffins) on the biggest parade ground in Islamabad,
    inviting all the people of the city to attend. Security? To hell with it. Let
    them taste the fear that countless helpless people feel today in Pakistan.  Similar
    public prayer should be held all over Pakistan. They will give courage to the
    ordinary citizens who despise what has been going for three decades but know that
    the state is not on their side.  Will it happen? No.  What can we do? Read
    all Pakistani newspapers, Urdu and English, make a note of all the hypocritical
    pieties that will be pronounced, also make a note of all the silences, and then
    Remember. Always, Remember.  Some of us should also do the kind of diligent
    work that many young people are doing in Pakistan. To my knowledge, Mubasher Lucman
    (mubashshir luqman) is perhaps the only TV personality who has boldly taken up
    the issue of egregious cruelty to Ahmadi Muslims. Clips of his show are available
    on YouTube. I was also very impressed by a young journalist, Mehreen Zahra-Malik,
    who exposed the constitutional and judicial nexus against the Ahmadis in an essay,
    \"Copyright religion.\" <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C04%5C28%5Cstory_28-4-2007_pg3_2\"

    maulanas at the Nadwa to thunder against the Ahmadis. He then went to a few other
    major cities to give the same talk."

  content: killing ahmadis was professed through banners haning in the vicinity of
    ahmadi mosques.many journals carry venomous articles that incite majority community
    individuals to attack/kill ahmadis. there have been talk shows at which ahmadis
    were declared to be wajib-ul-qatl.no action was taken even though within a week
    some ahmadis were killed after the telecast.every citizen who claims islam as
    his religion has to condemn in writing the ahmadi/qadiani/lahori while appying
    for a passport.average muslims going for juma prayers listen to hate sermons against
    ahmadis. killers are eulogised and defended.there have been instances when all
    the lawyers in a city refused to defend an ahmadi accused.state discriminates
    and encourages persecution of ahmadis. a hindu or christian can greet you with
    islamic salam alaikum but an ahmadi doing that can be punished legally with imrisonment
    and fine! even after the carnage at ahmadi mosques mullahs are defending those
    discriminatory laws.

<p>There is <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmersdorfer_Moschee">a mosque</a> near my house in Berlin. I bike past it every time. I often stop at the light, and enjoy the minarets against the grey skies. </p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/04-lahore-blasts-qs-07">a mosque in Lahore</a>, too. </p>
<p>Every attack, every atrocity, every massacre diminishes us all. This, I choose to lay at the feet of Mawdudi and his ilk, at the feet of Bhutto and his ilk, at the feet of our bearded muftis and their ilk. I blame those who deny citizenship to their brethren. I blame everyone who denies the freedom to practice their faith in peace. </p>
<p>I am afraid I have little else but rage and white hate for the perpetrators of this crime.</p>
