  content: "I am glad Chris Fair has seen fit to give free advice. It is particularly
    interesting that she chooses to suggest that this is a purely domestic issue at
    this juncture considering that she is well aware of previous acts of such terrorism
    perpetrated by \"Pakistani backed militants\" in India.  \r\nIt is probably convenient
    to pretend that this was a domestic attack, but the currently available information
    indicates that this was not the case. The terrorists were from outside, and came
    in boats. It is also likely that they were from Pakistan. There is a reason why
    accusing Pakistan is hackneyed-because it has often been true in the past and
    these accusations are all too often true (see e.g the recent bombings of the Indian
    Embassy in Kabul, or the attacks on the Indian parliament). Feel free however,
    to pretend that Pakistan is blameless, and does not train or sponsor any terrorists
    anywhere, and its state ideology is secular and considers all people and all religious
    persuasions to be equal."

  content: "Omar Ali,\r\n  That is an interesting analysis. I don't think though that
    the Govt of India will take any direct military action. Indian governments are
    generally averse to war and conflict, unless there is a clear and limited objective
    in mind (which is not the case here). I think this is a reason why they did not
    go to war after the Parliament attacks, which were at least as great a provocation
    as the current ones. \r\n  I also don't think that there will be any riots. Typically
    in my experience, rioting in India is due to internal events, rather than an externally
    provoked one-temples in India have been attacked without consequent riots (e.g
    the Varanasi attacks). If Pakistan does not cooperate, India maybe force to do
    something on its Afghan flanks though (this seems a possible scenario which will
    avoid outright war)."

<p>The aftermath of the horrific attack seems to be overlapping the attack itself - it is not over. However, information is starting to trickle out in the usual manner. Pakistan, Pakistani-based, ISI, Kashmir-based, "home-grown" are some of the usual suspects before us. I heard/read Somali pirates somewhere which did give me some hope that our script is not as hackneyed as any old Bollywood issue. But no. </p>
<p>These following links are worth your read.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are a lot of very, very angry Muslims in India,&rdquo; Ms. Fair said. &ldquo;The economic disparities are startling and India has been very slow to publicly embrace its rising Muslim problem. You cannot put lipstick on this pig. This is a major domestic political challenge for India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public political face of India says, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Our Muslims have not been radicalized,&acirc;&euro;&trade; she said. &ldquo;But the Indian intelligence apparatus knows that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not true. India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Muslim communities are being sucked into the global landscape of Islamist jihad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians will have a strong incentive to link this to Al Qaeda,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But this is a domestic issue. This is not India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 9/11.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>"<i>In the crowded suburban trains, you can run up to the packed compartments and find many hands stretching out to grab you on board, unfolding outwards from the train like petals ... And at the moment of contact, they do not know if the hand that is reaching for theirs belongs to a Hindu or Muslim or Christian or Brahmin or untouchable, or whether you were born in this city or arrived only this morning. All they know is that you're trying to get to the city of gold, and that's enough. Come on board, they say. We'll adjust.</i>" - Suketu Mehta, <i>Maximum City</i> [via Salil Tripathi's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/jul/12/didsomeonesaymumbaiwasrud">Bombay Can Take It</a>]</p>
