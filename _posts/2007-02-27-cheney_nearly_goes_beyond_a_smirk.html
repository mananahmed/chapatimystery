<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/lapata/405048595/' title='Karzai and Cheney having a bit of a laugh'><img src='http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/e165869d76224f59d4099363ffd84d14.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Karzai and Cheney having a bit of a laugh' /></a>In pictures of Cheney following <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1BB90E32-28A5-4AF6-A35F-78B90960943E.htm">the failed assassination attempt in Afghanistan</a>, he seems to be smiling in an almost non-smirkish way.  <a href="http://wonkette.com/politics/dick-cheney/assassination-attempt-inspires-cheneys-first-nearsmile-in-years-239984.php">According to Wonkette</a>, this is his first real smile in years.  Afficionados of the Cheney smirk <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/imperial_watch/perma_smirk.html">will remember</a>, however, that Cheney may not be able to move the right side of his face.  In this picture, his head is tilted a bit to disguise that fact.  Interesting to note that Hamid Karzai also appears to be having a bit of a laugh.  Maybe that's because no one has yet guessed <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/univercity/portraits/the_one-eyed_warrior.html">his secret identity</a>, despite the squint in his right eye.</p>
