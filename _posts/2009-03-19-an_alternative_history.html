  content: Thanks for this -- I have found other Doniger books that I have read very
    useful indeed, and this has all the trappings of a magnum opus.  On the comments,
    man I used to get so worked up about that sort of thing that for some years now
    I've just stopped paying attention; the problem of support for fascist and neo-fascist
    politics is all too often compounded by an utter lack of awareness about how academic
    research is conducted/academic institutions, and by an inability to draw a distinction
    between critiquing someone's position and ascribing bad faith/malevolence to them...

  content: "I like Wendy Doniger's work a lot; but that is a somewhat idealised reading
    of Hinduism imo. The actual mainstream texts are rare in mentioning the epsiodes
    she cites and even the ones that do are few and not central to much doctrinal
    beleif. In the canonical texts such thoughts are largely absent.\r\n\r\nThere
    is much that is brushed under the carpet as well; for example the story of Eklavya
    and Vali and the whole issue of the monkey-bear army in the Ramayana and the identity
    of the Rakshashas in that epic and the Mahabharata would be quite insulting to
    modern day adivasis whom they represent. There is no getting around this.\r\n\r\nThere
    was a great anti-caste BSP speaker that I used to listen in Lakhimpur Kheri, who
    used to use the tale of Hanuman to illustrate to his mainly Dalit and Tharu audience
    prescisely how they shouldn't follow the precepts laid down therein in their daily
    lives (ie always asking for more work, never seeking material reward, submissiveness
    to those of higher birth etc.).\r\n\r\nInteresting article though; the saffronists
    despise Doniger almost as much as Romila Thapar."

  content: "I think the point is not so much that Doniger is positing this as an \"essence\"
    of Hinduism, but that she is trying to suggest the multiplicity of voices in the
    sources, and how they might be used to construct an alternative narrative that
    does not \"read\" as an \"external\" critique; Amartya Sen tries to do something
    similar in  The Argumentative Indian, and it has of course been a common mode
    among Muslims/others seeking to defend the Quran against charges of misogyny and
    so on.  In all such cases I don't think anyone can reasonably deny that the \"counter-examples\"
    aren't as numerous/pervasive, but given how they are swept under the rug, it's
    great they are being highlighted...\r\n\r\nFor a polemic against Hinduism as \"irredeemable\"
    from the Dalit activist perspective, Kancha Ilaiah's \"Why I Am Not a Hindu\"
    is permanently useful; its vehemence, its anger, might not be to everyone's taste,
    but given the number of copies it has sold, and the number of Indian languages
    it has been translated into, its significance cannot be denied."

  content: PS-- in the case of both Sen's book, and (from the excerpt above), Doniger's
    book, it's prety clear that the authors seek to critique "the right" while also
    arguing against an "absolutist left" that would simply give up on "the tradition"
    (whether such an absolutist left is a strawman is a different question)...

  content: "True but I think there are more persuasive attempts like Thapar's works,
    DD Kosambi, DN Jha on beef-eating and Alf Hilbeitel's brilliant work on oral Dalit
    epics of Draupadi. I even think Arvind Rajgopal's work on Politics and Television
    does a brilliant job in looking at the televised religious epics and how it ties
    in with Hindu nationalism, questions of nuclear security and social change. \r\n\r\nIlaiah
    is brilliant in that book, particularly his analysis of how language can be \"productionist\"
    for the lower castes and more abstract for the upper castes. I think it is an
    essential read, far superior to VT Rajshekar's ramblings imo and of course better
    than that wannabe court sycophant Chandra Bhan Prasad. Teltumdbe is the only other
    writer who writes as powerfully about Dalit issues, though he is more academic
    and theoretical than Ilaiah.\r\n\r\nA small aside btw, Kancha maybe described
    as a Dalit activist but he actually comes from the OBC community, so is not strictly
    speaking a 'Dalit' in the narrow sense of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>whether such
    an absolutist left is a strawman is a different question</i>\r\n\r\nI think they
    might mean the middle-class leftist secularists who are militantly anti-religious.
    I have friends like these but they are a relatively small and not influential
    minority these days from what I can see."

  content: "<i>I have the Rajagopal book but hadn't gotten around

    That was the book, I mangled the title :) I also recommend Purniam Mankekar's
    \"Screening Gender\" which can be read as a companion. An excellent anaylsis of
    Draupadi's disrobing there as depicted in the Mahabharata televised epic. It also
    covers the \"Tamas\" series and a lot of other serials from the 90s from a feminist
    viewpoint.\r\n\r\n<i>On Ilaiah, I had heard he was serving as some kind of adviser
    to Mayawati some years ago; is this true?</i>\r\n\r\nHe might have done some years
    ago but I doubt it. The BSP is not a party that cares much for intellectuals or
    uses them; it is much more attracted to movers, shakers and fixers. Its excessive
    concentration of obtaining pure political power and the base it has amongst the
    lower bureacracy and public sector has meant that it tends to alienate real critical
    Dalit intellectuals, some of whom are now starting to speak out against some of
    its policies. Under Mayawati it has absorbed some negative casteist attitudes,
    so relies very much on 'influential' leaders or fixers who can forge such alliances;
    even bankrupt sycophants like Prasad are forever waiting for a call from Lucknow
    that will never come. There are also tensions between the Chamars and other Dalits
    over the division of power within the party but this is a separate issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Conrad:
    those books that you mention might be more persuasive as works of history, but
    I do not think they attempt to engage with Hinduism as (a) belief system(s) (i.e.,
    as opposed to analyzing the historical meaning/significance, etc. of the belief
    system), which is where Doniger's work (at least based on the
    other books I have read) is very useful.</i>\r\n\r\nPerhaps, I see your point
    but I would say that Thapar's work on issues like historical memory regarding
    Somnatha and the literary traditions of the 'many Ramayananas' and other interpretations
    of the tale told from Buddhist and Jaina texts is very important and sympathetically
    done imo.\r\n\r\nTwo books which you might like are Vasudha Dalmia's work on \"Nationalising
    Hindu traditions\" which  looks at the playwright Bharatchendu Harsichandra but
    actually covers an immense deal of ground on interpetations of Hinduism similar
    to what Doniger does but better related to current developments imo and Sheldon
    Pollock's edited volumes on the Ramayana, which while controversial is well worth
    a look for the depth of detail and engagement contained there."

    Draupadi is understood today as she is in a world where \"womanhood\" is defined
    in Sita-esque terms.  It doesn't really address the question of what the sign
    called Draupadi would mean in a world where womanhood was defined in her terms..."

  content: "A BBC article wrote about Wendy Doniger as, \"Professor Wendy Doniger
    is known for being rude, crude and very lewd in the hallowed portals of Sanskrit
    Academics. All her special works have revolved around the subject of sex in Sanskrit
    texts ranging from Siva: The Erotic Ascetic to Tales of Sex and Violence.\"[1][2][3]\r\nWendy
    Doniger has been criticized by Hindus and scholars from academia including Michael
    Witzel, Nicholas Kazanas, Antonio De Nicolas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N. Balagangadhara
    for her negative portrayals of Hinduism[4][5]; in particular, her article on Hinduism
    for Microsoft's Encarta encyclopaedia was so criticised. Subsequently, Microsoft
    removed Doniger's article and replaced it with an article by Arvind Sharma, Birks
    Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University.[6] A Washington Post article
    [7] covering the controversy quoted a former Microsoft engineer (Sankrant Sanu),
    a persistent critic (Rajiv Malhotra), and various academics, including Doniger.\r\nProfessor
    Michael Witzel of Harvard University has claimed that Wendy Doniger's of Vedic
    Sanskrit is severely flawed. When Witzel was publicly challenged to prove this
    claim, he published examples of Doniger's mistranslations and termed her translation
    as \"UNRELIABLE and idiosyncratic\".[8][9][10] Nicholas Kazanas, a European Indologist,
    also criticized Doniger's works and wrote that Doniger seems to be obsessed with
    only one meaning, the most sexual imaginable.[11] In the Journal of Indo-European
    Studies, Kazanas wrote, \"[Doniger] seems to see only one function ... of fertility
    and sexuality, copulation, defloration, castration and the like: even bhakti 'devotion'
    is described in stark erotic terms including incest and homosexuality (1980:87-99:125-129).
    Surely, erotic terms could be metaphors for spiritual or mystical experiences
    as is evidenced in so much literature?\".[11]\r\nThe visibility of Doniger's scholarship
    led to some protests; in one incident, an egg was thrown and struck a wall behind
    her during a November 2003 University of London lecture.[12]"

  content: "Re: \"So i don't understand how Judging Hinduism with
    a perspective of Abrahamic religious frame will not be called as biased\"\r\n\r\nThe
    problem with this is that, taken to its logical extreme, no one could critique
    anything except from \"within\" that \"frame.\"  Thus, even within Abrahamic religious
    traditions, one could argue that Islamic religious practices could not be critiqued
    because \"outsiders\" just don't \"get\" the culture etc. etc.  In fact people
    make this argument all the time, and not only is it not very tenable, one suspects
    it is often being made in bad faith (e.g. those who parry complaints about Saudi
    laws regarding women by resorting to \"hey that's the culture\" arguments aren't
    generally outraged by those laws to begin with).\r\n\r\nIn Doniger's case, the
    point is even more clear-cut: because she isn't criticizing a belief system, she
    is analyzing it (presumably she has some empathy for the subject, given that she
    has spent years studying it, but obviously her books aren't advocacy pieces of
    the sort in my examples above; you refer to her \"judging\" Hinduism, but where's
    the evidence that she is condemning in the way you seem to suggest? One might
    oneself believe that references to sexuality, etc. are per se pejorative, but
    that speaks to one's own views, and says nothing at all about whether Doniger
    or any other academic so believes.  Certainly I do not: I've always found accounts
    of the eroticism of Shiva and Parvati deeply engaging -- sure, \"erotic terms
    could be metaphors for spiritual or mystical experiences\", but the question why
    x as opposed to y metaphor?  Surely the intensity, the ecstacy, and the communion
    of the sexual act illustrates, like no other metaphor could, spiritual/mystical
    experiences?  Stated differently, in mythology/art/literature, sex CAN be \"about\"
    a lot \"more\" than sex, but it is surely never about \"less\" than sex.  And
    of course my point applies not just to Hinduism, but to the vast quantities of
    Sufi poetry that orthodox Muslims try their best to airbrush awa).  Thus, extending
    your point to this sort of situation would mean that not only could one not criticize
    unless one were \"within the frame\", but one couldn't even study, write, think
    about something unless one were \"within the frame.\"  Such an approach would
    lead to the death of scholarship, which would be replaced by more or less reverential
    recyclings of orthodox positions and received wisdom that we are all already familiar
    with."

  content: "Yes, but that is to put the cart before the horse imo. We have Sita-esqu
    defitions of womanhood not because some people arbitrarily decided to choose the
    figure of Sita over Draupadi but because the social orthodoxy and Brahmminical
    prejudices pretty much conditioned attitudes towards women in this way. And this
    was the dominant interpretation for much of the elite which held sway.\r\n\r\nTo
    say that Draupadi would have made the ideal basis for an alternative vision of
    Indian womanhood is really be asking that the  history of the last 3000 years
    and social structure be very different!\r\n\r\nI should also add that Valmiki's
    Ramayana tends to portray Sita in a more restained light but even here her anger
    at her treatment by Rama clearly outlines the injustice that she felt has been
    done to her simply because she was a woman and her anger at what she sees is Rama's
    typical male concern with his reputation over the feelings of his wife. In other
    versions of the Ramayana like Krittbas's 15th century Bengali version, this has
    serious consequences where the sons take revenge on Rama for their mother's exile
    in the forest."

    it is somewhat gratifying that he does at least call out the "Moditva" phenomenon.'

  content: "Sepoy--Good question... A forwarded flyer for her talk \"Including Dogs,
    Horses, Cows, Dalits, and Women: An Alternative Narrative of the Hindus\" (the
    lecture that is making the academic rounds to accompany the book's release) that
    I have since deleted from my email and can't quickly google down.  Aside from
    the talk's title (which for my taste is a little too \"sexy\"), there was also
    a multi-color Hanuman and voluptuous Indian female figure collaged together.  This
    flyer seemed to highlight the possible goofy Orientalist imagining of India as
    the illicit East.  As I understand from reviews of <i>The Hindus</i>, this is
    not what Doniger wants folks to get from her book, though it also seems to me
    that there is a slight tension between the argument and the \"hook\" of the book.
    \ Perhaps it is a balanced and productive tension; as Doniger advised in her response,
    I should probably set aside some time this summer to read the whole thing.\r\n\r\n(I
    am aware that it is very possible that I'm just being grouchy about a history
    that is intended for a broader audience.  For perspective, I also got a little
    upset when the New York Times started coming out with color photos, mumbling,
    \"If I wanted USA Today, I would have ordered it.\")"

<p><i>My narrative is alternative both to the histories promulgated by some contemporary Hindus on the political right in India and to those presented in most surveys in English--imperialist histories, all about the kings, ignoring ordinary people. But the texts tell us not just who was the ruler but who got enough to eat and who did not. And so my narrative is alternative in its inclusion of alternative people. How does one include the marginal as well as the mainstream Hindus in the story? The ancient texts, usually dismissed as the work of Brahmin males, in fact reveal a great deal about the lower castes, often very sympathetic to them and sometimes coded as narratives about dogs, standing for the people now generally called Dalits, formerly called Untouchables. The argument, for instance, that Dalits should be allowed to enter temples, an argument still violently disputed in parts of India today, can already be found, masked, in ancient stories about faithful dogs who should be allowed to enter heaven. So too, though Feminists often argue that Hindu women were entirely silenced, women's voices--their ideas and attitudes and, above all, their stories--were often heard and recorded by the men who wrote down the texts.</i> - Wendy Doniger, <a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/wendy_doniger/2009/03/the_battle_over_hindu_history.html">The Battle over Hindu History</a>*. </p>
<p>A few months ago, Wendy Doniger read a small selection to us at Chicago. The photo above was taken at that occasion. It was, as usual, a riveting narrative filled with imaginative connections. I have not purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hindus-Alternative-History-Wendy-Doniger/dp/1594202052/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1237493739&sr=8-1">the book</a> yet but I am looking forward to reading it soon. As always, she is a guiding light.</p>
<p>* The comments at <i>WaPo</i>, as usual, range from crazy to batshit crazy. As the book gets reviewed, this will only increase. Wendy has been on the receiving end of such Hindutva misogyny and hate for a long while and I have always marveled at her unflagging courage and persistence in facing the hate-machine.</p>
