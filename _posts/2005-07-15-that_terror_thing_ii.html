    //He can, and does, kill indiscriminately because everyone is, after all, the enemy.//

    Hmm, if I remember correctly, Anderson kills the "Agents" not the people and that too to defend himself when he was attacked while in the Matrix. So this is a very wrong example.

    That said, you have done a good analysis. When one goes to war, he should accept that there will be "collateral damages" - till now those who were waging the war talked of 'collateral damages' in Afghan and Iraq. Now what we are seeing is the same in Madrid and London

  content: "As the comments of Partha and tsk make clear, a film  analogy of the kind
    sepoy produces is eminently nit-pickable.  Nevertheless, I think it is an effective
    strategy for making a point.  The film The Matrix is put together in such a way
    that it is nearly impossible to view the scenario from the perspective of those
    who 'manage' the matrix (agents, architects, robots etc) - viewers come to see
    the matrix as a polity (if we can call it that) which sustains itself by subjugating
    and anesthetizing in a rather severe manner the vast bulk of humanity.  Cinemagoers
    by design sympathize with the 'terrorists' (cast here as freedom fighters) and
    we realize along with Keanu/Anderson that the matrix represents an incredibly
    oppressive world system that must be stopped for the good of humanity (the whole
    bodhisattva bit comes in here).   The reporting on the series of bombings over
    the last few years (US, Spain, UK) in much of the global mainstream media does
    the exact opposite - the conditions and ideologies that make people like the Leeds
    4 see themselves as freedom fighters are as inconceivable as it would be to view
    all of the identical agents named Smith in The Matrix as legitimate law enforcement
    officers doing counter-terrorism work.  This is a problem the 'they hate us because
    we are free' approach and the 'nothing we can do can stop them, so why bother
    thinking about other ways of dealing with this than war' interpretation do absolutely
    noting to resolve.  Perhaps a bit of sci fi can help us be a little more imaginative
    in assessing and addressing radical militant Islamist responses to the domestic
    and international policies of the allies in the so-called 'war on terror'. The
    point, however, is most certainly not to test it all out and see if these are
    perfect analogies."

  content: I agree with the first comment by Luke. This is nothing but refined sophistry.
    I notice that you are implying the prescription is to address the "selling points"
    i.e the root causes. And so you legitimize the very same "selling points". You
    imply the issue of injustice in "Palestine and Kashmir". I wonder how the issue
    of Palestine has anything to do with Muslims or Islam. After all this is all about
    land and displacement of a group from land, and this group includes non-muslims.
    You refer to the injustice in Kashmir, in the same context of the muslim community.
    What about the injustice resulting from the ethnic cleansing of the Kashmir valley
    by these jihadists with the same idea of "injustice"? You conveniently ignore
    the terrible injustices perpetrated in most of the "muslim world" including (I
    gather your home country Pakistan) to the minorities, both muslim and non muslim,
    living in these countries, as well as to their womenfolk, not to speak of the
    genocides (remember Bangladesh, 1971?) that they have gotten away with. If you
    expect all the communities to address the "selling points" of the jihadists, you
    better be prepared for the same questions to be asked of the societies the jihadists
    come from. It is a coward's way to blame the rest of the world for the problems
    they face, without ever taking a look at themselves.

    <i>It is a coward's way to blame the rest of the world for the problems they face, without ever taking a look at themselves.</i>

    Then Sepoy's post is evidently not cowardly, because he's asking us to take a look at ourselves.  Looking at ourselves and holding terrorists morally culpable for their murders are not mutually exclusive.

    Nothing in this post suggests that the "red pill" is good medicine; on the contrary, the jihadists' "red pill" is poisonous, distorted, wrong.  The question is: Why do terrorists buy the pill, or the story that it tells, and how do we get them to stop?  One view is that we get them to stop by putting those who have taken the pill into Gitmo, by actually using their story to terrorize them (we figure out, for instance, that their narrative laments the sexualization of the West, so we put women's underwear on their heads), or by putting more troops on the ground in the Middle East.  But those policies only feed the story, and make what is clearly a poisonous pill more palatable to more people.

    To question those policies is not to say that the jihadists' narrative is right.  It's just to say that by altering our policies--by courageously looking at ourselves--we may have the means to make the wrong narrative less widespread.

    Thanks for a great post, sepoy.

  content: "Zia, Caleb's got it right. The point here is to see that romanticisation
    <i>is</i> ocurring. There are people who might consider UBL The One; I don't know.
    What the analogy with <i>The Matrix</i> does is show that there is something about
    the \"Jihadist\" narrative that is universally familiar. People don't become terrorists
    because they're pre-programmed at birth to be \"evil.\" Something specific happens---they
    are offered a red pill/narrative and take it.  The language of the War on Terror,
    couched in absolute, universal terms like \"Evil,\" suggests that there is no
    possible way of winning short of extermination. People are pre-programmed as evil,
    for whatever reason, and there's no way of defeating that through structural change---only
    execution and \"freedom,\" which is a red pill narrative of its own. Let those
    who wish confuse the issue and blame sepoy for sophistry. No one is excusing or
    justifying anything (that I see), rather exposing underlying structures and ways
    in which there are similarities. Not all \"terrorists\" are Muslims, are Arabs,
    are brown, are whatever. But they are all human. So you tell me: can we learn
    nothing from Tim McVeigh?"

    It's worthwhile to consider some of the criticism that's been made of this post.

    Luke wrote:
    <blockquote>Refined sophistry, congratulations. Just what I expected you would come up with. I shall be referring friends to your analysis for further insight into how fascism incubates in various intellectual guises and atmospheres. </blockquote>

    While I can understand why some might find the <i>very idea</i> of a Matrix analogy a little glib for such a serious subject, I don't believe that the substantive points that sepoy makes about the nature of contemporary jihad are at all sophistical.  As the secular West confronts those would would negate it, we have to learn about those who hate, both to prevent their ideology from flourishing, and to use knowledge to undermine and defeat them.  Sepoy is hardly the only observer to remark on the intellectual and doctrinal bankruptcy of contemporary militant jihad and the "shame and helplessness" which may be felt by potential militants in a world increasingly dominated by Western secular and Judeo-Christian cultural values.  These are descriptions and explanations for violence, not excuses or justifications for violence.  Perhaps, we may not agree with the description of the roots of jihad that sepoy presents.  But if we disagree with his ideas, it is worthwhile to engage with them.  Why do you disagree with the diagnosis he makes?

    And, "fascism"?  Surely you didn't mean that literally.  At the very worst, sepoy's post is a little slick with an analogy.  It does not defend jihad, and certainly does <i>not</i> advocate fascism, a right-wing, undemocratic, nationalistic, racist ideology.  Do you intend "fascism" here to mean "any liberal humanism I dislike"?  Do you disagree that we ought to try to figure out what makes jihadists tick?

  content: "As for a later comment which echoes the charge of sophistry,  <blockquote>I
    agree with the first comment by Luke. This is nothing but refined sophistry. </blockquote> I
    am surprised that a second critic has had the grace to call the supposed \"sophistry\"
    of sepoy's post \"refined\".  I assume it's just a pat phrase.  But it is still
    the case that the mere use of a pop-culture analogy does not invalidate the ideas
    that lie behind it.  krisv, at least, does sepoy the courtesy of engaging with
    his ideas.<br /> <blockquote> I notice that you are implying the prescription
    is to address the \"selling points\" i.e the root causes. And so you legitimize
    the very same \"selling points\". </blockquote> You are right to imply that
    there is a risk that in our attempt to understand what motivates contemporary
    jihad, we may lend legitimacy to some of the grievances of jihadists.  We would
    presumably also agree that no grievance can justify the offhand slaughter of civilians.
    \ But even if <i>all</i> the \"selling points\" are inflated beyond resemblance
    to fact by psuedo-religious hyperbole, isn't it still reasonable to figure out
    what those selling points  are, and why they are so compelling to some, so as
    to counter their appeal, and cut off the supply of suicide bombers?  And in any
    case, is it not possible that <i>some</i> of the grievances have a grain truth?
    \ If so, isn't it not only right and proper that the West do what it can to alleviate
    them, but also thoroughly <i>wise</i> - in the interest of undermining our opponents'
    appeal - for it to do so?  And how are we to know truth from falsehood, unless
    we examine the claims?  Now, I can't provide a convenient list of all the possible
    religious, political, psychololgical, and cultural factors that might fuel jihadists'
    fury, but it's reasonable to start by looking at situations which the jihadists
    themselves say motivate them, social and political situations in Saudi Arabia,
    Pakistan, and, yes, Kashmir and Palestine, and Iraq. <br /> <blockquote>  You
    imply the issue of injustice in \"Palestine and Kashmir\". I wonder how the issue
    of Palestine has anything to do with Muslims or Islam. After all this is all about
    land and displacement of a group from land, and this group includes non-muslims.
    </blockquote>  Of course, there are, for example, Christian Palestinans.  But
    the \"displacement\" they share with Muslim Palestinians is still a huge grievance
    with many Muslims, and, at least, a convenient pretext for governments throughout
    the Middle East to avoid cooperation with the West.  Whatever you think of the
    justice of the Palestinian and Israeli causes, whatever arrangement an impossibly
    clear-eyed justice might bring to a riven land, I don't know how you can sincerely
    deny that the disposal of Palestine has become a central issue in the politics
    of Muslim countries, and central to the way very many Muslims view themselves,
    Israel, and the West.<br /> <blockquote>You refer to the injustice in Kashmir,
    in the same context of the muslim community. What about the injustice resulting
    from the ethnic cleansing of the Kashmir valley by these jihadists with the same
    idea of \"injustice\"?</blockquote>  To reiterate: sepoy was describing grievances
    used by militant jihadists to motivate themselves and others.  Muslim Kashmiri
    militants and various non-Kashmiri allied militants themselves say they the political
    status quo in Kashmir is a grievance.  To examine their claims is not to ignore
    the injustices they themselves inflict on others.  Of course, their violence is
    horrible.  But by trying to understand what they think, we'll strengthen our abilities
    to undermine their wrongheaded beliefs, and to defeat their violence. <blockquote>You
    conveniently ignore the terrible injustices perpetrated in most of the \"muslim
    world\" including (I gather your home country Pakistan) to the minorities, both
    muslim and non muslim, living in these countries, as well as to their womenfolk,
    not to speak of the genocides (remember Bangladesh, 1971?) that they have gotten
    away with. If you expect all the communities to address the \"selling points\"
    of the jihadists, you better be prepared for the same questions to be asked of
    the societies the jihadists come from. It is a coward's way to blame the rest
    of the world for the problems they face, without ever taking a look at themselves.</blockquote> You
    imply some familiarity with the recent history of Islamic societies, and with
    the history of the subcontinent.  I wish you showed similar familiarity with the
    blog you criticize.  This site <i>routinely</i> speaks out both against violence
    against minorities and against the inequities and systematic political repression
    common in some Muslim countries, and particularly in Pakistan.  Read the blogs
    on <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/the_rosa_parks_effect\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Mukhtar Mai</a> for a clear-cut opposition to rape and honor-killing.
    \ Look at <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/softer_side_of_freedom\"
    rel=\"nofollow\"> CM's recent thoughts on Musharraf</a>, and indeed virtually
    anything that sepoy writes about Pakistani politics.  In fact, in this very post,
    sepoy writes that \"the flashpoints of Palestine or Kashmir still need tangible
    justice,\" but he also states that \"dictatorships still need unbuttressing,\"
    so that their corrupt structures might collapse under their own weight. <br
    />A little attention to what sepoy actually wrote in this post doesn't hurt.  Of
    the ideology of the madrassas that urges young men to violence, he writes <blockquote>The
    Islam it presents is fundamentally and intentionally flawed. The structures it
    uses to propogate - madrasas or mosques or communes - are blindingly hierarchical
    so that no one can ever ask for information not deemed necessary. As to their
    objectives - they are concrete and designed towards political hegemony.</blockquote> You're
    right that \"the same questions\" should be asked of Islamic societies that some
    ask about Anglo-American policy in our confrontation with Islamic militants.  Looks
    like sepoy agrees with you.<br />"

  content: "I hope that my comments at older posts don't annoy readers/writer. Actually,
    I came upon this site a week ago and am going through the articles mentioned in
    the CM tour.   Has anyone read Talal Asad's book \"On Suicide Bombing\"?
    Is it worth a read? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/talal-asad/thinking-about-just-war_b_56605.html
     \"It is often claimed that particular wars may be unjustly declared, that
    wars may sometimes use immoral means and be concluded in a vindictive way but
    that in itself war -- even brutal war -- is sometimes necessary. \"Necessity\"
    makes us look for ways of justifying it. Terrorism, on the other hand, is always
    and in principle evil -- even though terrorists also claim that the atrocities
    they commit are sometimes necessary. Interpreting the motives of fighters is a
    tricky business but it is central to arguments about the distinction between the
    conduct of state armies and that of non-state gangs. Thus it is argued that the
    motives of military commanders are complex: they kill non-combatants but wouldn't
    if they didn't have to. Yet couldn't the same be said of the terrorist whose killing
    of civilians is at once deliberate and coerced? He has reached the limit, he has
    no other option left -- or so he claims, when he says that in order to try to
    defend his people's freedom he must carry out immoral killings. If he kills enough
    civilians (so he reasons) perhaps those who are politically responsible will respond
    in the desired way.\""

    radicalization of the jihadist internationalist youth. They are attracted by a

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/redpill.jpg">Why exactly did the Columbine killers decide to murder in cold blood their school mates? Or what are the motivations in any of the other cases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting">school shootings</a>? How do kids from a suburban family, with all the trappings of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/attackonlondon/story/0,16132,1527429,00.html">normal existence</a> decide to become deadly packages of terror? I ask because the biggest question on my mind is why did the Leeds 3 [not 4, as I originally thought] did what they did? They were all <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/attackonlondon/comment/story/0,16141,1528094,00.html">British</a>. They were all of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4683073.stm">Pakistani descent</a>. They were all <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/attackonlondon/comment/story/0,16141,1528484,00.html">Muslims</a>. Is it ordained that only in those indices of identities an answer must be found? So, let's question what it means to be British. Let's figure out what destructive gene is carried by Pakistanis and let's identify the virus that is Islam [let me guess, salafi, wahabi, sunni craze?]. My point is not that terrorism is akin to random violence in the school or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal">workplace</a> but that we need to cast a wider glance at the instances of social violence, if we are to try and figure out the Leeds 4. We have to question the assumptions that we are making about the terrorists and their actions. We have to question the narrative that is dominating policy and public.</p>
<p>Let me try this columnist trick of pop-culture philosophy: One movie about terrorism that gives us hints towards understanding the Leeds 4 is 1999's <i>The Matrix</i>. Its protagonist, Anderson, has a pretty ordinary existence. He lives just below the radar, quietly. He has a disquieting feeling that the majority world-view is somehow off-kilter; that there is something wrong with the world; that he doesn't really belong. He has heard of this terrorist who preaches some terrible truth. He is curious. Eventually, the terrorist, Morpheus, makes contact with Anderson and offers to tell him the truth. He offers him the red pill which frees his body/mind from the lies around him. He becomes one of the chosen few who have the capacity to see, and <i>fight</i>, the world. What about the innocent people who live in this world? he asks. They cannot be saved, he is told. <i>"That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Business people, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy."</i> Anderson buys the whole argument. It makes sense to him. He is part of the select few, the cell, the chosen one. He belongs, finally. No one can harass him anymore. He can, and does, kill indiscriminately because everyone is, after all, the enemy. </p>
<p>Jihadists tell a similar narrative. They convince the foot-soldiers that reality is a cryptic illusion and that it is their narrative red pill which unpacks the hidden meaning [and hidden atrocities] in this reality. This jihadist narrative has its pivotal moments - the 1967 war, the Afghanistan struggle, Kashmir, and now, the Iraq War. This narrative is driven by the language of faith and religion but that is almost <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/09/AR2005070901425_pf.html">incidental</a>. This narrative uses two primary techniques of manipulation: shame and helplessness. Shame from subjugation, from moral decadence, from a fall from grace. Helplessness from lack of access to <i>real</i> power, from secrets and groups who control all events. It is a cyclical and highly repetitive narrative that continously stresses the victories of Israel or the US. It proves those feelings of disquiet were right. That the racism had a reason. That the powerlessness came from a source. And it says that the destruction of those responsible - the Zionists and the Imperialists - can only come by annihilation of the self while engaged in a war - an asymmetrical war that targets innocent civilians, who are the enemy. This narrative concerns itself with a particular and peculiar historical past - a specific teleology. The Islam it presents is fundamentally and <i>intentionally</i> flawed. The structures it uses to propogate - madrasas or mosques or communes - are blindingly hierarchical so that no one can ever ask for information not deemed necessary. As to their objectives - they are concrete and designed towards political hegemony. Christians, Jews and Muslims are all equally invalid. Remember, <i>they are all enemies</i>.  </p>
<p>Olivier Roy or Nazih Ayubi's work has consistently pointed out that the jihadists [Roy's neofundamentalists] come from middle class families and are almost always under the age of 30. They point towards disenfranchisment, sexualization of society, and alienation as pivotal factors in their initial attraction of these young men and women towards the jihadists. The Leeds 4 - "normal" kids all - bought the narrative because maybe they were all susceptible in those ways. Maybe the pitch was made in a local mosque or in a kebab house or on the cricket ground. Maybe they got further training in a madrasa. The question we have to ask is why? Why did they buy <i>that particular</i> narrative? Why not any of the many other narratives that would explain their lives? What are those alternative narratives? </p>
<p>The flip-coin of my question is why isn't every British Muslim of Pakistani descent in Leeds not a suicide bomber? Obviously because there is no magical seduction in the jihadist narrative. Yet, it remains a challenge for all of us who believe in the liberal ideals to seriously engage with it. It should not be dissmissed as ahistorical or unmodern. The liberal response of secularization or modernization is not only pat and inadequate but wrong. The WH response of Gitmo or Abu Gharib or Fallujah is just more grist for the mill. The jihadist narrative can easily be shown to lack basic structures of truth and logic and built on expoitation - yet, the flashpoints of Palestine or Kashmir still need tangible justice; dictatorships still need unbuttressing. We have to address the selling-pitch points squarely. No way around it. Still, it can be effectively countered by other narratives of Islamic, South Asian or diasporic pasts. But, we have to highlight those narratives - we have to fill the vending machines of history with them. We have to have answers based on justice when asked what is wrong with this world. The "we" is not just the Muslim community but all who construct and consume daily narratives - from No. 10 Downing Street to BBC to Friday Imams. Above all, we cannot dismiss religion - we have to take the believers, and their faith, seriously. How? Later, maybe. </p>
