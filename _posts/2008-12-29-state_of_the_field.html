  content: "My contribution is humble. The two titles that I have read on South Asian
    history in the 00's were both bought at the great airport mall.\r\n\r\nI would
    add The Great Arab Conquests How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live
    In. By Hugh Kennedy. It is a spectacular story, even (particularly?) when told
    without the standard Islamic mythology. There is a lot of \"but how do we really
    know this is what happened\" and \"even if it is very unlikely that this happened,
    what clues can we find in the myth itself.\" \r\n\r\nI also enjoyed Dalrymple.
    \ Why is he last, and not on your lists? Why controversial? Why the possibility
    that he would have a negative mark?"

  content: Not a specialist on S. Asia but two assigned books I recall liking are
    Guha-Thakurta's Monuments, Objects, Histories and Pinney's Photos of the Gods.  I
    left the seminar with the vague impression that Modern South Asian history momentum
    was shifting to art history.  objects, objects, and more objects

  content: "Thanks, just when I was making my list for generals :-)\r\n\r\nI'd definitely
    recommend Mrinalini Sinha, Spectres of Mother India: The Global Restructuring
    of an Empire (Duke, 2006) which is one of the best works I've seen that manages
    to mainstream gender history and place the \"national movement\" in a transnational
    field. \r\n\r\nI'd also imagine that Vazira Zamindar, The Long Partition  And
    The Making Of Modern South Asia (New York, Columbia, 2007) and Joya Chatterjee's
    The Spoils of Partition (Cambridge, 2008) would be must reads for all those who
    want to push against the 47 barrier.\r\n\r\nLastly, Manu Goswami, Producing India:
    From Colonial Economy to National Space, University of Chicago Press, June 2004
    forces us to rethink Chatterjee and brings political economy into the cultural
    turn."

  content: William Dalrymple's 'The Last Mughal'? Why in the world? One could possibly
    argue 'White Mughals' was influential in that it  popularized early modern Indian
    history aongst a wide readership. But why 'The Last Mughal'?

  content: "jawad: WD is last because the list is largely chronological. He _is_ on
    the list. The negative mark is not him/his work but whether the field will recognize
    that TLM demonstrates a hunger for well-written social history in the general
    public and, well, produce such work. If they ignore him/the book because of the
    occasional bombasticy of his comments/claims, it will be a negative mark.  The
    academic crowd is under no obligation to think about the general public, though,
    it seems.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that Doniger's newest is dedicated to WD and
    for the general public and hence an excellent start."

  content: In these days of Niall Ferguson, and imperial "rehabilitation", I would
    also suggest Dirks' "The Scandal of Empire"...and Guha's "India After Gandhi"
    is a really good addition to the "survey" histories written for a general readership.

  content: The Other Side of Silence by Urvashi Butalia (2000) a shocking omission
    imo. One of the best accounts of narratives from the Partition that seeks to take
    into account marginalised voices and covers highly sensitive topics such as the
    "missing women" phenonmenon with great sympathy and insight.

<blockquote><b>update:</b> On FRIDAY, JANUARY 2, there will be a roundtable discussion of the state of the field, moderated by David Ludden and possibly others. The event will be held in THE HILTON NEW YORK, NEW YORK SUITE (4TH FLOOR), FROM 5-7PM.</p>
<p>I will be there. See you all there, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking out aloud about the historiographical landscape of current South Asian studies is a pretty silly thing to do at Medici's coffee shop ("Obama Eats Here!"). You get all kinds of unsolicited advice - <i>what do you mean Burton Stein's <i>History of India</i> is under-appreciated?</i></p>
<p>If most of the 80s and all of the 90s can be given over to Subaltern Studies in particular and Postcolonial Studies in general, than how will we look back on these 00s? </p>
<p>Since 2000, I think these four titles are significant and merit (ed) widespread attention (in chronological order): </p>
<p>1. Dipesh Chakrabarty. <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_LgfM0Q4kwIC">Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial thought and historical difference</a></i>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000.</p>
<p>2. Velcheru Narayana Rao, David Shulman, and Sanjay Subrahmanyam. <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ffFMJNa_jdwC">Textures of time: writing history in South India 1600-1800</a></i>. New York: Other Press, 2003.</p>
<p>3. Richard Eaton. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cGd2huLXEVYC"><i>A Social History of the Deccan, 1300-1761: Eight Indian Lives</a></i>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.</p>
<p>4. Sheldon Pollock. <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0UCh7r2TjQIC">The Language of the Gods in the World of Men: Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India</a></i>. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006.</p>
<p>It is instructive that the latter three are concerned largely with the pre-modern. But maybe, this shows <i>my</i> bias more than a trend. Casting widely, I think the following would have to be on, again, my list of "significant" works on South Asian history since 2000. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ronald Inden, Daud Ali and Jonathan Walters, <i>Querying the Medieval: Texts and the History of Practices in South Asia</i> (2000)
<li>Ayesha Jalal, <i>Self and Sovereignty: Individual and Community in South Asian Islam Since 1850</i> (2001)
<li>Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi, <i>Refashioning Iran: Orientalism, Occidentalism, and Historiography</i> (2001)
<li>Cynthia Talbot, <i>Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra</i> (2001)
<li>Nicholas Dirks, <i>Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India</i> (2001)
<li>Romila Thapar, <i>Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300</i> (2004)
<li>Muzaffar Alam, <i>The Languages of Political Islam: India 1200-1800</i> (2004)
<li>Manu Goswami, <i>Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space</i>, 2004
</ul>
<p>Romila Thapar, <i>Somanatha, the many voices of a history</i> (2004), Partha Chatterjee, <i>A Princely Impostor?: The Strange and Universal History of the Kumar of Bhawal</i> (2002) and James Laine, <i>Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India</i> (2003) are of special interest to those of us who dabble in questions of memory and history. </p>
<p>Most recently (and this may very well be controversial), I think William Dalrymple and his <i>The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty: Delhi, 1857</i> is going to leave a mark on the field. Hopefully, a positive mark. Looking ahead, Wendy Doniger's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hindus-Alternative-History-Wendy-Doniger/dp/1594202052/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230601740&sr=1-2">The Hindus: An Alternative History</a> is going to be monumental. </p>
<p>What would you add?</p>
