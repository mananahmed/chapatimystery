  content: "Thanks for writing about this.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed tunnel vision that
    the US has when it comes to countries that are geo-strategically significant to
    \"US interests.\" It matters little what the citizens think, desire, or aspire
    to. There are numerous examples in history.\r\n\r\nThe crackdown of the press
    just adds more fodder to the idea that Musharraf needs to go."

  content: 'It''s not amusing to see our history repeat itself again and again. In
    the not too distant past we propped up one right-wing dictator after another in
    the "national interest" of opposing the spread of communism, with little regard
    for the fate of the people living under such rulers, nor for their right to self-determination.
    Many Americans accepted this without having any clue about what the people in
    such countries actually were like or wanted: as they were told, it was either
    this ruler stays in power or communism will be the inevitable result. Now we see
    the same thing, with only slight variations: either this guy stays in power or
    Islamists take over; either this guy stays in power or terrorists have their way
    with us. It''s doubly  exasperating to hear all of our candidates (yes, even ones
    I like) dish out the same nonsense so they won''t appear "weak" to us. What can
    I say. Ultimately the Pakistani people will decide for themselves, right?'

  content: "Nusrat:\r\n\r\n\"Instead of blaming America, why not take a mini tour
    back into Pakistan's history.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with you that
    one tends to lay the blame on America often. But you cannot discount the fact
    that a superpower can apply pressure to weaker states, no? For example, look at
    how many Pakistanis have vigorously protested Musharraf's sacking of the Chief
    Justice and the attempt to quiet journalists who are critical of him. And yet
    the US has pledged its support of the Musharraf regime. This isn't just by words,
    but by multi-million packages of weapons and support. This fact is not lost on
    critical Pakistanis (and others, obviously, like myself). \r\n\r\nPakistan's lack
    of democracy from its inception has certainly laid it vulnerable to the whims
    of superpowers, but it's not enough to say, \"Look at Pakistan; don't blame at
    the US.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blame Jinnah first, whose lust for power and hatred led to
    the partition.\"\r\n\r\nAre you sure about this? I'd like to know where you are
    getting this idea from (books? mags? ideological assertions?). Jinnah wasn't \"lusting\"
    for partition; in fact, the Muslim League was initially against the idea of partition.
    Furthermore, there were Hindu fundamentalists who had also been prime supporters
    of Partition as well. So it's not simply Jinnah's lust for power and his hatred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Blame
    the Generals, who following Jinnah's demise never allowed democracy
    to even get a foot hold, let alone foster, like it did in India.\"\r\n\r\nOk,
    the Generals have been messed up; but come on, you're holding up India as a paragon
    of democracy. Though these are in some ways all separate arguments, are you thinking
    about Indira Gandhi when you say this? The anti Sikh riots that left 3,000 people
    dead? The Gujarat pogrom of killing nearly 2,000 Gujarati Muslims? NONE of the
    inciters and participants of this violence- to this day- have been charged with
    any crime and/or murder. This absolute impunity that murderers enjoy does not
    resonate with \"democracy\" at all. There are many, many incidents that are not
    as high profile like the above three that seriously challenge the idea that India
    is not the land of milk, honey, and democracy. When we talk about a just law being
    equally applied to everyone, when aberrations in terms of sidestepping the law
    are no longer the norm, and so on, then we can talk."

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/06/01_04.gif' alt='media boycott' width='210'/>Last night during the democratic debate, a history professor asked the candidates what they thought of the lack of democracy in Pakistan under Musharraf. Obama responded first with some baloney - something about hunting UBL or something. Hillary followed suit and said she thinks Musharraf is doing the best he can. Only Edwards answered him directly and stated clearly that the United States doesn't just want democracy but a particular type of democracy and what if Musharraf goes and Islamists come to power? </p>
<p>Remarkable, isn't it, this tunnel vision of imperialism? Even a cursory understanding of Pakistani history can show the lack of traction the Islamists have had. Even a dubious grasp of current events can demonstrate the solid pushback by ordinary citizens against the Talibanization of Pakistan. But here we stand...the ying and yang of Pakistani analysis in any and all public spheres of USA: Musharraf or Else.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the General issued an amendment to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance (2007) "barring television networks from airing talk shows and carrying out live coverage of events relating to the judicial crisis". Today <a href="http://www.geo.tv/">Geo TV</a> and <a href="http://www.aaj.tv/">Aaj TV</a> - two popular cable channels - were <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/06/04/top4.htm">shut down</a> by the State from broadcasting across the country [and specifically in major metropolitan areas]. More restrictions will undoubtedly follow. </p>
<p>Edwards, Obama and Clinton may not know this - or care - but the Press in Pakistan has been the most vital organ of civil society throughout its existence - through Ayub or Zia or Bhutto or Nawaz. The rise of cable channels has been largely on the back of opinion and news shows anchored by strong personalities with live-studio call-in elements. These same channels carried live footage of the MQM thugs shooting and killing on May 12 as well as the police raids on the channels for attempted shut-down of the transmissions - much to the embarrassment of the spin machines.</p>
<p>Like I have been saying since the judicial crisis started, this is the General's endgame. He has no real moves left beside force and oppression. He has finally lost the hearts and minds of even those, most forgiving souls of Pakistan's silent majority. The wise move would have been for a face-saving election, but with the blessing of freedom and liberty, Musharraf has decided to toss aside the farce of <i>Enlightened Moderation</i> and embrace his inner Mugabe. </p>
<p>You can see the outrage pouring from <a href="http://blog.jang.com.pk/view_comments.asp?id=921">citizens</a> and <a href="http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/asia/pak04jun07na.html">observers</a>.</p>
<p>To my journo readers, this story is worth your time. I hope you can help give it some traction. I wrote off an op-ed to the NYT but since I don't have a book out, it ain't getting printed.</p>
