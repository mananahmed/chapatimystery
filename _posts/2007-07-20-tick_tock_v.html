  content: "\"I find it hard to imagine how The General will survive all this.\"  According
    to the Dawn, the PPP is going to \"back\" Musharraf:  \"The talks between
    the government and the Pakistan People's Party have made some
    headway, with the PPP reportedly assuring the ruling coalition that it will not
    create hurdles in the way of President Gen Pervez Musharraf's
    attempts to get re-elected from the present assemblies, according to some highly-placed
    official sources.\"  http://www.dawn.com/2007/07/20/top9.htm  And
    this, after Musharraf jailed some of their members!  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/05/AR2007060501899.html  I
    thought PPP was one of the opposition parties...?"

    its blind support for BB, and that at least some of the leaders do too, and break
    away from the mother ship... in Aitzaz Ahsan, they have an electable leader...
    of course he's been around for ages, but after driving the CJP around the country
    and dishing out yet another defeat to Sharifuddin Pirzada, he's more than just
    an intellectual in the Senate...  BB has a history of giving in to the generals...
    it is said that she was ready to cut a deal with the man who hanged her father,
    no less... luckily for her, he died... this time too, she wants to go against
    the will of her voters by supporting Musharraf... I just hope her voters finally
    see the light of day..."

    may be wrong, but she has always struck me as someone who doesn't really have
    a clear and consistent platform of her own; her positions are often whatever the
    overriding popular sentiment at the time is. She's a bit of an opportunist, in
    my opinion.  And in reference to what you have said about Bhutto, Comment
    is free published this speculation that Bhutto and Mush are discussing a \"power
    sharing agreement:\"  http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/simon_tisdall/2007/05/_pakistans_odd_couple_eye.html
      Ugh. One victory (CJ one), but several setbacks- Bhutto, the PPP's reported
    solidarity with Mush, and the US' unwavering support of Mush in light of the National
    Intelligence Estimate."

    this handy acronym any way you please) a \"bit of an opportunist\" is like calling

      and yes, i hope the feudally-minded PPP and its feudally-spirited voters
    can finally grow the b*lls (there's a request here to \"keep it clean\") to ditch
    the b*tch, so to speak. (i doubt it though)"

  content: "Well, what can one say about BB... in 1988, she had the world at her feet,
    and look what she did to that opportunity... picture: the man who hanged her father
    was dead, the establishment had conjured up the IJI and rigged the elections,
    but still couldn't stop her from winning, she had been greeted by hundreds of
    thousands in Lahore no less upon her arrival in 1986, and whats more, when they
    found out that she was pregnant, the dates of the elections were chosen to coincide
    with the delivery (they actually missed it by a month or so)... and the generals
    were unwilling to accept her as PM, but in the end they had to give in... the
    first female head of a Muslim state, educated, eloquent, good-looking... and look
    what she did...  The trouble with the Bhutto clan is that they've always
    taken the loyalty of their voters for granted, as if its their divine right...
    I remember reading \"The Terrorist Prince\" last year, and Raja Anwar was of the
    opinion that this tendency afflicted not just BB but her brother too... when Bhutto
    pere was overthrown, some of their workers set themselves on fire to protest...
    the Bhuttos just took this for granted... similar examples abound...  Going
    by their past record, the best the PPP workers/voters will do is to stay away
    from the polls if they're angry at BB for her deal with Musharraf... more likely,
    they'll come up with some sort of justification for the deal... in either case,
    the combined opposition, featuring the MMA will gain from this, not to mention
    the PML-N and the Tehrik-e-Insaf... lest we forget, they're enough to the right
    to be more comfortable with the MMA than with the PPP anyway...  That leaves
    the liberal/left \"represented\" by a dictator and an opportunist..."

  content: "I feel ashamed in asking this, but I don't really know what the \"deal\"
    entails. Times of India in May reported that she would be able to return if she
    supported the Mir Khan Jamali government.  ****   Umar:  \"Then
    again, she says she might come to an arrangement if such an arrangement is necessary
    for ensuring fair polls&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; confusing?\"  Not confusing,
    just very middle of the road. I think she is less interested in a robust, democratically
    active citizenry than she is in her gaining political power. Hence, the odd stance.
    So she's \"bit of an opportunist.\"   But now I am not in a generous mood
    anymore, so I say she is TOTALLY A HYPOCRITICAL OPPORTUNIST. :)  http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=52217  And
    speaking of this deal, here's what Nawaz Sharif had to say:  \"Referring
    to the PPP's deal with President Musharraf for the upcoming
    elections, he said: &ldquo;It is not a matter of elections, but the
    restoration of democracy without the army's involvement.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Freedom cannot be begged, but one should struggle
    for it,&rdquo; he added.   He expressed his reservations about
    the recent growing contacts between the PPP and the government. He said the PPP
    had violated the CoD, as the accord &ldquo;prohibits any deal with
    a dictator&rdquo;.\"  http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C07%5C23%5Cstory_23-7-2007_pg7_19  On
    PPP's own website, in May this was published. Who's scared of the deal? Why, no
    one who's interested in \"democracy\"! And anyway, you can't bring democracy through
    \"street protests\" and of course, \"President Musharraf is not averse to political
    deals if they bring stability and promote democracy.\"  http://www.ppp.org.pk/Party/Party%20Issues/P_articles61.htm"

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/07/img-1php.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Celebrate' />The Supreme Court of Pakistan, finally realizing that they can do better by not <a href="/archives/homistan/lawless_in_pakistan.html">trussing up</a> the dictatorship, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/world/asia/20cnd-pakistan.html?hp">reinstated</a> CJ Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and nullified the <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6228&Itemid=2">reference</a> filed against him by Musharraf.</p>
<p>I find it hard to imagine how The General will survive all this. CJ Chaudhry back at the bench will surely pick up where he left off - hearing cases about the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/19/asia/pakistan.php">disappeared</a>. Musharraf has lost all credibility and legitimacy since Feb/March. Even the Lal Masjid operation provided temporary relief. The General has already declared that there will be elections and he will run in them 'in uniform' - which sounds as unhinged as anything Yahya declared in East Pakistan. </p>
<p>In the meanwhile, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/07/20/top1.htm">human bombs</a> continue to blast away.</p>
<p>I feel like reciting some <a href="http://www.roshanpakistan.com/urdu/poetry/ahmad_faraz/poems/ab%20kay%20hum%20per%20kaisa%20saal%20para%20logo.php">Faraz</a> but I will restrain myself. </p>
