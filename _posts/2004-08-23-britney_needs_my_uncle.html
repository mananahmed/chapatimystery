  content: I am keeping my fingers crossed to see what really is on Britney's mind.
    The western lifestyle is surely getting weirder.

    It just goes to show: even Britney Spears is just plain <i>better with tablas</i>.

    Sorry, couldn't resist.

    This does promise to be a weird video. By casting for a bunch of old dudes, maybe it's something akin to the "I'd like to buy..." Coke ads, just all old guys getting along instead.

<p><img src="/img/olddude.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Britney was seeking to cast her new video and, apparently, she asked for a Pakistani. She should have called me. Unlike <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/000192.html">sven</a>, I am not a fan of Ms. Spears talents but I do want Pakistan getting proper respect in soft-core music videos. I would have asked one of my retired elders to lend some dignity to the proceedings.<br />
But seriously (ok, I kid) what could possibly be the script for this music video that calls for a 100 year old Pakistani male? Is he a pimp-daddy? A mystic? Perhaps Britney wants to show the softer, older side of Pakistan which is not busy fighting War On Terror By Proxy...the waaay older side. I really, really want to know.<br />
Also, I want to make sure that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700875/">Om Puri</a> does not get the role. He is a screen hog.<br />
