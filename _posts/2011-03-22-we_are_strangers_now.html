  content: Thank God I only studied in Pakistan until I was 12 years old. I shudder
    to think what would've happened to me had I not moved away in time. Is it any
    surprise that we have an entire generation of young people for whom informed analysis
    is that which focuses on the unseen hidden hands of hidden powers?

  content: "Hasnain, your orgasmically celebratory comment is annoying. I studied
    in Pakistan till I was 19. I was well aware of all the crimes my country had committed.
    Hell, by the time I was 12, I'ld accumulated enough political horror stories that
    only the combined slaughter of 1971 could outway the stuff I'ld seen and heard
    during my childhood. There are many in Pakistan who have not forgotten, and
    in reaction to the prevalent reaction, make an effort to remember what happened,
    and why. And all those who mumble on about foreign hands are marked as intellectually
    incurious, gullible idiots, with a likely vested interest in an iniquitous status
    quo."

    e waqt, urdu digest and almost all of those digests had stories and stories of
    '71 on every december 16th and  my mother would actually cry with tears and would
    make my heart swell up too. I can still feel the pain. it was real. my turning
    point was reading Faiz in 1991. then i spent years investigating '71 and other
    things. but i think knowing somewhat truth did not make me a better human being.
    It just made me a very angry man.

  content: "Sorry for the long post, but this is the text of his speech at BRAC University.
    Obviously it covers some of the same ground:   Liberation War-Historicizing
    a Personal Narrative                                                                  Ladies
    and gentlemen, thank you for providing me with this opportunity to be in the great
    city of Dhaka and be in the BRAC University addressing this august gathering.
    But this interaction can only be meaningful if you ask me questions. I will answer
    your questions honestly and candidly. Hopefully, we will add to each others' knowledge
    in this interaction . Historicizing a personal narrative is difficult in the
    best of times. Recalling 1971 is a very sensitive issue and it touches most of
    us very deeply.  First, a litte of the personal: I was in Dhaka at the Army
    Ordnance Depot at Tejgaon from 1962-1964 and in 3 Commando Battalion at Thakurgaon
    and Chittagong from 1965-1966. As an army officer, I also happened to know several
    Bengali officers who later became major players in Bangladesh.  Among them, General
    Zia-ur-Rehman was a fellow instructor at Pakistan Military Academy. Brigadier
    General Khalid Musharraf was my roommate and course mate at Military Academy and
    a fellow officer in the commandos in the early sixties. General Mir Showkat Ali
    was also a course mate in the Military Academy. Major Ziauddin of the Naxalites
    and now a maulana is a personal friend. Brigadier Abu Tahir was a fellow officer
    in the commandos and a friend too. Many of my students at the Pakistan Military
    Academy also rose to high ranks in the Bangladesh Army. The life of an average
    West Pakistani officer in the then East Pakistan, remained confined to cantonments
    among the overwhelming majority of West Pakistani officers. The handful of Bangladeshi
    officers who had also served in West Pakistan were naturally much more relaxed
    here. But the majority of Bengali officers remained distant from the West Pakistani
    officers, who occupied the command and key staff positions. I spent the happiest
    four years of my life here, but my life remained confined to family, office, officers
    mess, Dhaka Club. Language is the house of being. We remained non-beings in Bangladesh,
    or alien beings in this respect  ,because we did not learn the Bengali language.and
    did not partake of the rich culture of this land.  While my personal experience
    in Bengal had been very positive, the story in the historical context was very
    different. The Bangladeshi fellow officers in the Pakistan Army rarely became
    close personal friends with West Pakistani officers. Even two of the very prominent
    Bengali officers, Lt Col. (Retd) Qayyum, whose elder brother was the Head of Bengali
    Dept at Dhaka University, and Group Capt MM Alam of air force who stayed on in
    Pakistan, are now  alienated and lonely beings.  People as prominent as Sher-e-Bangla
    Mr. Fazlul Haq and Mr. Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy, despite their prominence in
    the Pakistan Movement and Pakistan politics , were alienated by the dominance
    of West Pakistanis in politics  ,which  resulted in the creation of the  Awami
    League, which played a central role in liberation. AK Fazal Ul Haque started his
    career  as early as Praja Conference of 1914 . Mr Surawardy was not only a Prime
    Minister , but opened the China door door and set up Pakistan Atomic Energy Commision
    and Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Technology . all these came to play key roles
    in our subsequent history . There may even be some lesson in history ,in the sub-continental
    context , in the fact that the Neta Jee Subhas Chander Bose was the most fascinating
    of figure in the forties . He was very different from Mr. Gandhi. Who was more
    right is a question for you to decide. In any case, \"History,\" as Hegel said,
    \"has a certain cunningness and history is always rational.\" We the Punjabi Pakistanis
    were fighting against reason and we were the oppressors. At the same time, Sheikh
    Mujib-ur-Rehman's leadership defined the rationality of history. The Indian Army
    only acted on the rationale that had been created by the Awami League victory
    in the 1970 elections. But today I want to talk about Bangladesh and my limited
    personal experience in the midst of these historic and tragic events..                Before
    I move on to the grim events of 1971, let me recount some of my earlier experiences
    in Bangladesh that may illustrate the way we, as army officers, thought and were
    encouraged to think. Qne of the major political events of the sixties was the
    1964 winter presidential election, contested by General Ayub Khan and Miss Fatima
    Jinnah. Historically, it was a non-event, but it gave me some insight into the
    working of the civil government at the time. I, a young  non-entity of a captain,
    while doing election duty in Manik Ganj subdivision of Dhaka district, was personally
    called on the telephone by Mr. Monem Khan, the then Governor, to say that the
    area magistrate police officer and Member National Assembly were working for the
    Combined Opposition Party. I submitted that I had come on duty in aid of civil
    power and the magistrate and police officer were supposed to tell me what needed
    to be done and not the other way around.  Again, while on duty during the Hindu-Muslim
    riots in Narayangunj area, I received a call from Governor House to ask why I
    was feeling restrained by the DIG Police and magistrate, i.e.: I should go out
    and open fire whenever I felt the need. During the  day, I had been reprimanded
    by Gen. Yahya, the General Officer Commanding,  as to why some civilians were
    standing around as he drove past. I said that I had been evacuating some Hindu
    families who had been attacked. \"You are not the Red Cross, boy!\" the General
    had roared.  It is likey that he had reprimanded the Governor as well. I was then
    ordered to carry a machine gun instead of single shot rifles and the DIG and magistrate
    were removed. Legally, the position was that the GOC was junior to the governor
    and I was way junior to the DIG and magistrate, and I was also supposed to get
    their written permission before opening fire. But in actual practice, the GOC
    could order the governor around and I could freely bypass the civilian magistrate
    and the senior police officer. The next significant political event in the
    sixties was the Agartala Case. In 1968, at Staff College, we were given a briefing
    by Director General Military Intelligence. It was done very dramatically, by shutting
    all doors and with music from the movie \"From Russia, With Love.\" It was a common
    joke in the officer messes , that the Bengali officers called each other &ldquo;General&rdquo;,
    a rank they would supposedly hold when they seceded from the Pakistan army. What
    we had always treated as a joke was now being cited as \"treason discovered.\"!
    The farcical nature of the &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; can
    be gauged from the fact that someone as junior and insignificant as an air force
    sergeant and corporal were also mentioned as major characters in the conspiracy
    to topple state authority.  I felt then that we were headed for disaster because
    the powers that be were living in another world. The die was finally cast in the
    1970 elections, but rumbles could already be heard. I was  at heart against martial
    law and West Pakistan ruling over East Pakistan. But I was a young nobody and
    among a tiny minority in the army. The 1970 election was as cyclonic as the
    cyclone over Hatya Island that year. The Six Points had been voted for and that
    meant autonomy for then East Pakistan. Bangabandu had thrice used the word \"Bangladesh\"
    in his election speech in Nov 1970. The then head of Pakistan Television, Mr.
    Roedad Khan, has written that he had told Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman to delete these
    words. But the agreement was to allow the leaders to say what they wanted and
    he refused to delete those words, it was aired as such. The results were stunning.
    History had been made. But while the fellow Bangladeshi officers were elated,
    West Pakistanis were not happy with the results.  Then came the unwillingness
    to accept the election results, the military action in East Pakistan and the Liberation
    War  !The  war touched your lives deeply and those who lived through it in Bagladesh
    \ mentally and physically paid a very heavy price. The entire population of Bangladesh
    was terribly  oppressed when the army ran riot. Death stalked everyone's life
    and neither life nor honor nor property was safe. I unfortunately, was  a witness
    and participant in those events, though I never killed anyone or ordered anyone
    to be killed. Still, I knew and heard about a lot of killing and other atrocities
    \ . I may have a thousand stories to tell of what I saw from early April 1971
    to early October . But one persons, experience is not history nor its accurate
    picture .                                                                   I
    rejoined in 3 Commando Battalion on 10th April, 1971 as second in command of the
    battalion and took over its command on 6th June 1971 and was there till the beginning
    of October 1971. A detachment of this battalion had arrested Bangabandu Sheikh
    Mujib-ur-Rehman on the night of 25th-26th March 1971, only two weeks before I
    joined it. I was directly under the Eastern Command Headquarter and  I interacted
    frequently with General Niazi GO C-in C Eastern Command, and General Rahim and
    General Qazi, commanders of 14 Din and Gen Mitha who assisted Gen Tikka till Gen
    Niazi took over. The first major incident was the arrest of Sheikh Mujib-ur-Rehman.
    Colonel Zaheer Alam, who led the detachment  charged with arresting him, saluted
    Bangabandhu and said, \"Sir, we have been ordered to take you into custody.\"
    According to his book , when he reported to Eastern Command after the arrest the
    three generals, Gen Hamid, Chief of Army Staff, Gen Tikka and Gen Mitha who were
    present all  asked only one question: \"Why did you not kill him?\" Imagine, if
    he had been shot, that would  have been a catastrophe and changed many things
    even further for the worse. The reaction would have been far worse and the whole
    of Bangladesh would have gone up in flames.  But though we did not kill him
    then, did we not murder him as well as Mr Bhutto in a span of four years in the
    late seventies?  In Pakistan the state apparatus was dictatorial and willful and
    it got worse over time. ,The State's insensitivity to the dictates of law and
    justice was neither political nor civilized. It would decide the fate and state
    of the nation. Murder Incorporated had taken over.   I arrived in Bangladesh
    on 10th April 1971 .On 11th April 1971, I traveled to Rangpur as one of our sub
    units was there. The night before, I had heard enough accounts at Army and Air
    force messes. I wanted to orient myself. Most of the boasting in the messes was
    of the night of the generals on 25th/26th March   and how a brigade column from
    Joydeblpur had &ldquo;sorted  out&rdquo; Dhaka. There were
    tales galore of the Mukti Bahini's alleged massacre of non-Bengalis and there
    was an album of blood and gore at Chittagong.  When I got to Rangpur, the senior
    tank unit commander boasted of how he had lined up the miscreants, the noisy political
    workers who had taken over the town till 25th March. He added some professors
    too for good measure. Then he took them all to a nearby brick kiln and had them
    shot. When I asked if there was any resistance or use of arms by those people
    or others in town, he said, \"Nadir, you should have seen how they behaved before
    25th March. They jeered at us&rdquo;. &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.that jeering
    and protesting was apparently enough to earn them a summary death sentence.  Then
    he added, &ldquo;One of my Bengali officers too-he was protesting
    too much. I had him shot too.\" I mildly protested \"He was a fellow officer and
    only a proud kind?\". And he was a brother officer.  Sympathy for civilians was
    even less likely.  While the commanders in Rangpur were painting a picture
    of too much resistance in Rangpur, Gen Mitha had landed there in a helicopter
    singlehandedly with a Bengali ADC, whose pistol was the only weapon they carried.
    He rebuked the local commanders. He had known Bangladesh and knew what and how
    much resistance was likely. Perhaps his background also mattered. Gen Mitha, from
    Mumbai, was married to a Christian lady of Bengali origin, whose father was, Dr
    Chatterji, the famous philosophy teacher .  The other had come to be defined in
    religious terms in India and Pakistan. Your level of education and political beliefs
    could go only as far as the fellow soldiers and your army commanders allowed it.
    There was a feeling of revenge among the troops for the social siege and aggressive
    political stance of the Awami League. The soldiers thought that Awami Leaguers
    were not patriotic. But the senior commanders/Generals led the way and decided
    that this supposed rebellion had to be put down with the force of arms.  Somewhere
    the think tank had also decided that Hindus were the root cause of the problem.
    Orders were given to spread out and pacify by force of arms, by terrorising and
    by picking out and killing the Hindus. A license to kill, given to a soldiery
    with a besieged mentality, to whom the whole of Bengal appeared alien, made it
    a free for all, a horrifying dance of death.                        I had gone
    from West Pakistan. I found relief in walking out and seeing for myself. I drove
    all the way from Rangpur to Dhaka by road with only a driver and our personal
    arms. I faced no resistance or threat. If you were sympathetic with the politics
    of the people and could gauge the extent of resistance, you saw hought and behaved
    differently.   My first so called operation was on 15th April, after a day
    of aerial reconnaissance, I took off with two columns of commandoes and was helidropped
    east of Faridpur town. I was told \"It is a hard area. It is Mujib-ur-Rehman's
    home district. Go and let them have it! And pick out especially the Hindus.\"
    The man giving orders was my old teacher and friend.  I said \"Sir, I cannot kill
    anybody who is not armed or firing at me. Don't expect me to do that. That is
    against the law sir, even if it is martial law.\"  He said \"You have just
    come from West Pakistan, teaching your Bengali students and drinking with your
    Bengali friends, you don't know what has been happening here.\" When finally
    I was dropped on the road to Pabna, east of Faridpur, we took position and fired
    to make a base for ourselves. We were up high on the road. On the low ground,
    I saw some civilians running towards us. I halted the firing. \"What do you want?\"
    I asked the man with a bucket. \"We have brought water for you to drink.\" I ordered
    a ceasefire. We sat down, resting against the bridge wall and started making tea.
    I asked the civilians, \"I saw Awami League flags here yesterday, from the air.\" \"Sir,
    we have taken those down. We have put up a Pakistan flag. You can see one from
    here.\"  I did not know whether to laugh or cry. Then I saw a glimpse of collaboration.
    The villagers were kicking and dragging a poor fellow. \"Sir, he is an Awami Leaguer
    and was demanding money from the villagers.\" I searched his pockets and found
    some thirty bucks. I returned these to the villagers. \"Should I shoot him?\"
    asked a soldier.  \"I will shoot anyone who so much as touches his weapon.\"
    I said. But the villagers too wanted to join us in eliminating this innocuous
    symbol of rebellion. They wanted to earn our approval.  Soon the main army column
    that had come through the city of Faridpur . They were setting fire to every village
    along the road.  \"What is the score?\" asked a Rommel like colonel standing
    in a machine gun fitted jeep.  \"Sir, there was no resistance so we killed
    no one.\" He gave a burst from his machine and some of the innocent onlookers
    standing around us fell dead.   The next episode was around 25th April ,
    to clear Barisal , the last district town to come under army control. I knew the
    area and had gone as a guide with the battalion attacking Barisal. The advance
    party of thirty who had gone by naval gun boats the night before was missing.
    The colonel waited out the night on the outskirts and called an air strike before
    moving in the morning. As we moved forward, the city of Barisal had already been
    conquered by our missing advance party of thirty men! Only a sweeper, whom the
    colonel had killed in panic, was a casualty. But after that the battalion did
    do a lot of killing and looting, as I learnt later during a tour of the area.
    Meanwhile, \"Three-pronged attack on Barisal repulsed,\" said a banner headline
    in an Indian paper from Calcutta.  On 6th June, from a dug-in position  a
    regular rebel battalion of East Bengal Regiment in Belonia with minefields, repulsed
    a brigade attack from the Pakistani army . The 53 Brigade from Commila  failed
    with forty dead. I was called in to give commando support to a reinforced brigade
    attack .  The night before the planned  attack I jumped into the midst of the
    battalion at night. We faced little resistance as we were in the midlle of forward
    and rer positions .   Where the brigade attack had failed, I succeeded. The whole
    salient next morning was found vacant .  Somehow, with this I became a hero. My
    CO, who had refused the mission, was sacked and I became commando battalion commander.
    The General commanding 14 Div,  Gen Qazi, after that took me along on most visits
    and I traveled all over Bangladesh. We provided flying guards to PIA aircrafts
    flying in the area and I could issue air tickets. I was very mobile.  One day
    after my taking over as a commanding officer , they announced demonetization of
    big  denomination notes . I was sitting having tea in my balcony. It was raining
    and I saw a lot of high denomination notes flowing down into the drain. Some soldiers
    of mine had obviously looted those notes. My command  was going to be difficult.
    I would never know what would happen when I turned my head! I was also reminded
    of an event in a distant past .In 1947 after the first monsoon rain on Aug 16
    ,1947 I had seen looted material floating down a drain. How many holocausts was
    one to see in a life time !   To stay away from the kill and burn forays
    on the home ground, I started operations across the border with volunteers provided
    by Jamaat-e-Islaami. I met Prof Ghulam Azam and Ch Rehmat Elahi, who used to come
    to my office. I also frequently met Mr. Fazlul Qadir Chaudhry and Maulana Farid
    Ahmed.   I did not indulge in any killing nor ordered any, but I was aware
    of a lot of killing and looting done by the army all round. Dhaka. At the same
    time, a false sense of normalcy prevailed in the limited circuit of my social
    life i.e , Dhaka Club, Officers Mess, Chinese food near Dhan Mandi. Meanwhile
    every Bangladeshi was oppressed and terrorized, even if not directly a victim
    of it. When I saw hundreds of abandoned cars on the Ghat on the road west of Dhaka
    and saw a fleet of cars in my own unit, I was aware of the missing or robbed masters.
    There were nearly 10 million refugees in India and more than ninety percent of
    them were Hindus. Casualty figures may have been exaggerated, but every citizen
    was scared and oppressed and  feared for his life .Nobody felt secure even in
    his own house. When I received orders to move back to West Pakistan for my
    promotion at the end of September, I was suddenly shaken out of my state of unreality.
    I completely lost my mind. I got out of my VIP power boat over Rangamati lake
    and got onto a nauka to share dal bhat with the surprised poor boatman. I was
    dined out later that evening by the rich and famous of Dhaka. I was also given
    a farewell dinner at Gen Niazi's house, who as usual gave me the gift of some
    dirty jokes that always interspersed his daily order sessions.   I returned
    to West Pakistan and broke down with paranoid schizophrenia, completely out of
    touch with reality. I was a  mental patient for two years , was hospitalized for
    six months and lost my memory in the process of treatment. I was retired as a
    disabled person in 1973.  Over many years, I have rediscovered and reconstructed
    myself as a Punjabi poet. I  acquired  a literary and artistic consciousness from
    Bangladesh and I hope I can now validly represent the literary conscience of Punjab
    .  Now, as a Punjabi poet and writer I offer apologies and ask forgiveness
    from those who suffered so terribly in 1971. And I want to say that there are
    many more in Punjab who feel the same shame and regret and who are also discovering
    a connection between the military mindset that led to those tragic events and
    our own loss of culture . But alas at the time of my departure no one except my
    brother —in- law Justice Sajjad Sipra , decried my choice of
    posting . Today, the world is changing fast. Any of the three looming crisis:
    the falling dollar, rising oil prices or runaway inflation and high food prices
    may ruin us and the regional economy. Let Bangladesh, which is thriving after
    liberation, lead the way. And why not ; it was here that you first talked of praja
    , the people  , swaraj  the independence and Liberation War Mukti Judh . Be it
    Azad Hind Fauj . Krishak Praja Dal or Mukti Bahini , these all had their origin
    in Bangladesh .  Neither across the ocean nor across the Himalayas is anyone coming
    to rescue us. Together, we three can make a formidable alliance. Let us attend
    to our teeming millions of poor and not be misled by our habitually misleading
    leaders. Half of the entire world,s poor live in the sub continent  . Let us not
    raise huge armies that can only destroy each other. I will sum up with Faiz Ahmed
    Faiz's lines on Bangladesh:  \"After how many Shraban rains,  Shall be
    washed the blood stains After friendly intimacy. We became strangers again.\" There
    was a lengthy question and answer session .Instead of twenty minutes I spoke for
    over an hour at the directions of the chair and people received it very well and
    wanted some more .There had been a lot of discussion on the subject of War Crimes
    Tribunal .When asked my opinion , I submitted , &ldquo; Sir between
    you and me , the War criminals do very well in life . The real culprits always
    live well above the Law . Only poor and politically marginlised people will be
    prosecuted.&rdquo;"

    of the 1971 war. Do you run the Bangladesh Genocide Archive? That site is fascinating.
    I wonder who is transcribing the material from urdu and bangla into English.  Anyway,
    your father sounds like an amazing man."

  content: we Bangladeshis are not much different from you. we were taught a lot of
    myths about 1971 in our school history books. i am glad that we as young students
    were least interested in those subjects, and studied just to take tests. later
    we would forget them completely. the majority of young people in Bangladesh don't
    know why the Old pakistan broke. the little they know is all political rhetoric.
    few people know how Non-bangalis were massacred by some Bangali armed cadres and
    how some conservative Bangalis in the ulema were also not spared. our disinterest
    in studying the one-sided accounts may be a result of listening to our parents'
    nostalgia about how their lives were in the Old pakistan, how careers took some
    of them to West pakistan, their relations with West Pakistani neigbours who came
    to reside in the East, the Urdu/Bangla movies of that time (Punjabi films were
    probably not big then), the Dhaka-Karachi trips and the general prosperity people
    in the two wings of the new nation were experiencing. later some young Bangladeshis
    found a way to vaguely acknowledge how 'evil' the Pakistanis are and at the same
    time, enthusiastically support Pakistani cricket. rather we find little factual
    basis to keep practising the former. i am delighted to see many Pakistanis supporting
    our cricket team. the history books should reflect the true history of our countries.
    i expect our history books to include both Bangladeshi and Pakistani input

<p>No one born after 1975, in my family's circle of acquaintance, remembers the fall of Dhaka. They don't know the year. They don't know that Bangladesh was created out of blood spilled by their own army. I asked them what they had been taught in schools and they said nothing. I went to the market and purchased the history text books assigned in the Punjab Textbook board (serves a population of ~ 80 million and mandatory for all school/college students) for grades 7th - 12th. For giggles, I also purchased the M.A. History curriculum from Punjab University. These are my tweets as I read through them:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to PK History Textbook Grade 12, Jamaluddin Afghani (d. 1897) supported the Pakistan Resolution on Mar 23rd, 1940. #FAIL</p>

<p>Today, Pakistan plays the West Indies cricket team in the World Cup Cricket quarterfinals. Today is also March 23rd, the day celebrated with tons of patriotic fervor. It is on March 23rd, 1940, in Lahore, that the Muslim League made a demand for separate state(s) for Muslims in India. This <a href="http://radhikaranjanmarxist.blogspot.com/2009/09/bangladesh-lahore-resolution-1940.html">Lahore Resolution</a> became the political platform for League and the elections/negotiations during and after WW2. Today, the memory of East Pakistan and the sins of West Pakistan lay forgotten. I have a piece in <em>Pakistan Today</em> on this. Go <a href="http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/pakistan-news/Opinions/Columns/23-Mar-2011/Blind-spots-of-history">read in full</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In that soil lies the writer of that Lahore Resolution of 1940 — A K Fazlul Huq (d. 1962). There lies also Khwaja Nizamuddin (d. 1964) who was the second Governor General and the second Prime Minister of Pakistan. There, next to him, lies H S Suhrawardy (d. 1963) who was the fifth Prime Minister of Pakistan. These men were the architects of the Lahore Resolution though their visions differed on significant points with that of Quaid-e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. They urged for a Pakistan that was inclusive, diverse and which was the sum of all its parts. Their graves in Dhaka signal the deepest silence in Pakistan's history. A silence that extends all over Dhaka and the bloody violence it suffered in 1971. It became a city soaked in the blood of its own inhabitants, as the, then, West Pakistani army purged it of its intellectuals, its leaders, its poets, its dreamers, its students. After the separation of East Pakistan, the creation of Bangladesh, the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report valiantly tried its best to document that bloody Dhaka but it fell short and, in any case, the report itself lays forgotten by patriotic Pakistanis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note: The title is taken from Agha Shahid Ali's translation of Faiz Ahmed Faiz's 1974 poem, "On My Return from Dhaka": </p>
<blockquote><p>After those many encounters, that easy intimacy,<br />
we are strangers now —<br />
After how many meetings will we be that close again?</p>
<p>When will we again see a spring of unstained green?<br />
After how many monsoons will the blood be washed<br />
from the branches?</p>
<p>So relentless was the end of love, so heartless —<br />
After the nights of tenderness, the dawns were pitiless,<br />
so pitiless.</p>
<p>And so crushed was the heart that though it wished<br />
it found no chance —<br />
after the entreaties, after the despair &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; for us to<br />
quarrel once again as old friends.</p>
<p>Faiz, what you'd gone to say, ready to offer everything,<br />
even your life —<br />
those healing words remained unspoken after all else had<br />
been said.</p></blockquote>
