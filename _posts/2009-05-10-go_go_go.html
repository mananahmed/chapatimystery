  content: "notice: No Burning effigy of the taliban. \r\n\r\nCould it be because
    it would be weird for bearded guys in salwar kameez to burn bearded guys in salwar
    kameez?  Or is it a sign that the taliban are not as hated as america and mush?"

  content: 'Yes man:  the reason for burning effigies is a symbolic one - effigies
    are of individuals who are associated with the cause/country/issue being protested.  since
    there is no one visually recognizable leader associated with the taliban, it doesn''t
    make sense to burn an effigy of a ''bearded guy in shalwar kameez'', since that
    beareded guy in shalwar kameez could be my grandfather.  and no, my grandfather
    is (rather was) not a fundamentalist or an extremist of any sort.  Apologies if
    you were making a joke, but your comment comes across as a little offensive.   Also,
    wrt to your (rehetorical?) question at the end, I would advise against trying
    to read complex political statements into such symbolic acts as effigy burnings.'

  content: "\"Or is it a sign that the taliban are not as hated as america and mush?\"\r\nNobody
    left their houses when 'Taliban\"  were   \"running the place\"(SWAT).\r\nNow
    military with approved dollars has its kind gaze on the area and people are fleeing
    in hundreds of thousands. Make your own deductions"

  content: "It is interesting that you made the observation that you made. \r\nAre
    you implying that Pakistanis identify with Taliban or perhaps all bearded ones
    do? I have a feeling that if there was a picture of a bearded man burning a bearded
    effigy,  you would point out something else like the effigy isn't big enough or
    the beard on the effigy isn't long enough or that the protestor's beard isn't
    long enough or that he isn't wearing the right kind of Shalwar Kameez :-)"
