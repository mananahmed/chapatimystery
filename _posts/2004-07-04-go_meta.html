<p>Our friend Paul has a <a href="http://www.metameat.net">really interesting thread</a> going on. He is letting readers ask questions and he answers them as only he can - so damn cleverly. It is some <a href="http://www.lacunae.com/archives/000222.html">meme</a> or other going around the blogosphere that I am too damn lazy to partake in. But do read Paul's and then come back and tell me which questions were asked by me (hint, 3 consecutive).</p>
