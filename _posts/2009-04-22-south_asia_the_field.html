  content: Thank you for this list. I will soon be a complete outsider joining a History
    program, for unclear reasons under the "south asia" tab - and I am getting really
    worried about "area studies"!

    published by the University of Chicago''s Committee on Southern Asian Studies,
    for a look at these issues through a retrospective lens (the text was published
    in ''85) focussed on one department''s history.'

  content: there is an amazing young anthropologist called leo coleman doing this
    kind of work (aka, figuring the origins of India as subject matter for social
    scientists in the 50s &amp; 60s) at Princeton (though perhaps he's moved on).
    I would add McKim Marriott's early works to your list too -- and R.W. Nichols.

  content: John P. Lewis has some essays on this in "Indian's Political Economy" and
    there was a very good article in the 1980s in EPW by PAul Brass; where he argued
    that US scholars who studies India and South Asia, by large ended up being advocates
    for their subject of study back in the US in policy and advisory circles. Mostly
    relevant for India but could be extended to the region as a whole.

  content: "As I recall, the first person to raise these issues and also cause much
    stir by his 'whistle-blowing' was Prof. Gerald Berreman of UC Berkeley. In response
    to my request he kindly sent me the following. Back in those  days, Nepal was
    an important Cold War front.: \"\"In answer to your quest for information on
    cloak and dagger activities of academic colleagues in India and Southeast Asia.
    \ I was indeed involved in trying to expose such skulduggery, as were a number
    of others.  My most succinct,  effective written piece -- and explicitly on the
    topic you described was the following;  it may suffice: 1969  Berreman, Gerald,
    \"Academic Colonialism: Not So Innocent Abroad,\"  _The Nation_ [magazine], 209:16,(Nov.10,1969)
    pp. 505-508.  Some others:  1971  Berreman, Gerald. \"Ethics, Responsibility
    and the Funding of Asian Research,\" _The Journal of Asian Studies_,  Vol, XXX,
    No. 2, Feb. 1971: 390-399.  1968  Berreman, Gerald. \"Is Anthropology Alive?
    \ Social Responsibility in Social Anthropology,\" _Current Anthropology_,\" 9:
    391-396, 425-427.  1973 Berreman, Gerald, section editor and contributor:
    \"Social Responsibility and the Anthropologist\" (pp. 5-61), and \"Anthropology
    and the Third World\"  (pp. 109-179). _In_: _Anthropology  and Modern Social Issues._
