    not so much."

    \ just try telling a maharashtrian that hapus-alphonso is overrated (which it
    is).  every once in a while you get a truly exquisite florida mango, but
    most of them are a bit too acidic and fibrous.  too much inbreeding, perhaps."

      Btw, the best flavor of Mangoes (and one that comes closest to the subcon
    variety) is a brand from Mexico called Marathon. Hard to find, but it is reasonably
    good."

    few weeks! :) Can someone identify the varieties in the photos?"

    good mangoes from central america pretty much year round (sorry, slow/local food
    folks: i''m good about other produce but can never pass by a ripe mango). my buddy,
    who loves to gnaw on the pits, got me a mango splitter/slicer from amazon which
    is amazing, so now i split and she gnaws and we both are blissed.'

  content: "IMO, the best mangoes in the world come from the Philippines, particularly
    the Philippine Carabao mango. In terms of physical appearance, sweetness, juiciness,
    and fiber content, they are superior to any mango I've ever tried. Interestingly,
    in 1995 the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Philippine Carabao mango
    as the sweetest fruit in the world.  Don't be fooled by the label \"Manila
    Mango\". You might think that they are grown in the Philippines. That label is
    a ploy used by Mexican businessmen to market their mangoes, and are inferior to
    mangoes grown in the Philippines."

  content: I'll second the opinion on the Philippine Carabao mango!! In a pinch, the
    Marathon mango from Mexico will get you your mango fix. After you try a Philippine
    Carabao mango and you try some other brand you will be disappointed as there is
    NO substitute.

  content: The very best mango's to buy are the Marathon Onese outta mexico later
    on in the season like mentioned before. But i also really Like Farmers best produce
    mango's from mexico also just as much. But earily on in the season (march-sept)
    Mango's that come from guatamala are the very best in my opinion. Usually the
    mexican mango's are sweetest Mid - late in the season. I live in an area where
    some local small ethnic produce/meat markets almost know their produce as well
    as me. Lucky i guess

Enough doom and gloom ... mangoes are in the market people! MANGOES. Mangoes like Sarholi, DoSahri, Almas, Sindhri, Choonsa, Anwar Ratol....which must mean that <a href="/archives/homistan/first_day_of_summer.html">summer</a> is nearby. And guess what? Next summer, we desis stuck in pardes will be able to buy some of those fine, fine Sindhi mangoes in <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=945&Itemid=2">Chicago</a> too. </p>
