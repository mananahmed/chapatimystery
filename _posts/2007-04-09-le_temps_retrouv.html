  content: happy anniversary!  and hurrah to lapata (who i'm hoping might license
    that awesome ataturk portrait for a book cover someday) for ensuring that the
    show's continued to go on.  we're glad y'all are still here.

  content: "Heartiest Congratulations! And many thanks to Lapata....your analysis
    of Cheney's abbreviated smile was quite entertaining.  Is this a sick joke?
    CM going under? Never. Good blogging must prevail...and while I'm at it, I implore
    sepoy to post, post more. Perhaps you are not stuck behind an office desk all
    day and are not privy to the trials of locating decent blogs on the internet...and
    frankly, though there  exist many a fine blog, CM outshines them all like the
    sun outshines a candle and unlike my metaphor here which outshines nothing. No.one.comes.close."

    a big middle finger for Sepoy for threatening to bail.

<p>It all began on <a href="archives/homistan/basmati_rice.html">April 8th, 2004</a>....this Chapati adventure. <a href="/archives/holydays/welcome_to_the_dollhouse.html">Year One</a>. <a href="/archives/holydays/happy_chapati.html">Year Two</a>. And now it is the end of Year Three!</p>
<p>That it still continues is rather astounding to me. My wholehearted thanks to the amazing contributers - lapata, farangi, dacoit, bulleyah - and to all of my thoughtful, engaging and gentle readers and commenters. </p>
<p>But the credit for CM surviving it's third year goes entirely to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lapata/">artist</a> and <a href="archives/author/lapata/">blogger</a> extraordinaire, lapata.</p>
<p>If you have enjoyed a single post on CM since July 2006, gentle reader, thank lapata. I was going to close shutters here - for various reasons. And it has been her involvement, her awesome posts and her amazing humor that has kept me going. </p>
<p>I have something to say - maybe entirely too much and maybe entirely too messy - about my experience as an 'academic blogger'. Look forward to that post. In the meantime, join me as I wish CM a happy birthday...and thank lapata and farangi for being here for all of us. </p>
<p>Let's see if we make it another year.</p>
