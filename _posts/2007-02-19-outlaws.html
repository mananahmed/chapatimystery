  content: "The NYer also had a fascinating piece 'Hip Hop Machiavelli' on the influence
    of 'The 48 Laws of Power' a while ago--not online sadly but written about here:

<p>I absolutely demand that you read Samantha Shapiro's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/magazine/18djdrama.t.html?ex=1329454800&en=47aa2cf1c159a3e0&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Hip-Hop Outlaw</a> from NYT Magazine. It is such a great read with asides like "(The Fox report on the DJ Drama raid included a shot of a grave-looking police officer saying, &ldquo;In this case we didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t find drugs or weapons, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not uncommon for us to find other contraband.&rdquo;). Furthermore, I absolutely recommend <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39829/Clipse_Hell_Hath_No_Fury">Clipse</a>'s <i>Hell Hath No Fury</i>. </p>
<p>While we are on the subject, anyone catch SFJ's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/">riff</a> on Arcade Fire in the NYer? He gets their live insanity right - their show we watched in Chicago kicked ass - and he points out that they own their distribution channels. </p>
<p>ps. I really wish NYer would use permalinks.</p>
