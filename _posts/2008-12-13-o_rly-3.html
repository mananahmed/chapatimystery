  content: "Long time reader of this blog, one of my favorites. Curious what you think
    of the Hoodbhoy interview, actually Juan Cole says something quite similar in
    Salon as well:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/15/stories/2008121556691100.htm\"

  content: 'Sasha: I think Pervez Hoodbhoy''s interview was good (a bit simplistic)
    - though my one quibble is that he continues to defend the Army. Or at least,
    he defends portions that he believes are good. I just don''t see  how the Army
    can be a force of good in that nation, any more. His broader points stand: the
    state is in three different civil wars, it is militarily over-extended, and the
    only solutions are internal growth of civil infrastructures, political dialogues
    and a reduction of the anti-Americanism.'

<p>George Packer, in the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/12/15/081215taco_talk_packer">NYer</a>: "The core problem is that Pakistan is no longer really a country, if it ever was."</p>
<p>Actually George, the core problem might be that <i>you</i> (read, U.S.) have never understood it as a country.</p>
