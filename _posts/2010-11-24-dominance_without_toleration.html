  content: "I agree that on so many occasions, the illiterate village farmers use
    the name of blasphemy to settle their personal rifts but Law of Islam is very
    clear regarding the honor of Prophet Muhammad Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam, His
    companions and family members and the accused if found guilty is to be executed.  So
    no one holds anything against one as long as any one be it muslim or non-muslim
    commits any of the above mentioned acts, everyone has equal right to enjoy the
    life in Pakistan but no one holds a single right to insult any of the religions
    (major or minor) that exists in Pakistan."

    Bukhari has Allama Iqbal leaving 'Nathshay' /Nietzsche speechless and dumb following
    an intimate pillow talk. Except Nietzsche died in 1900 and Iqbal left Cambridge
    for Germany only in 1907 or thereabouts. Who knew Iqbal could raise the dead and
    beat them around with a large copy of Bahishti Zewar?  That the learned
    professor refers to Sipah Sahaba's Azam Tariq adoringly as a Maulana in a mainstream
    publication is only a reflection of how far the syphillis of jihadism and bigotry
    has mutated Punjab's cultural dna."

  content: "Blasphemy laws ensure that such outrages will continue and their repeal
    will be resisted since they have served their purpose well. These  blasphemy laws
    were put in place to enforce a hardline Islamist vision that the Pakistani security
    establishment regarded as a useful tool (some were true believers in it, others
    were using it as a tool, hard to say which group was larger, I personally lean
    towards the notion that most of our security elite are pure opportunists). In
    any case, they helped to create and nourish a mindset that the deep state considered
    desirable. But the project has run into a problem. The deep state also has an
    actual state to run. That actual state has to exist in a world that does not match
    Islamist fantasies.  This real world can be very cruel and criminal, but its biggest
    gangsters are not Islamist gangsters, though they did use Islamist toughs in the
    bad neighborhoods. In fact, they now regard Islamist gangsters as something of
    a menace (though some may still regard them as useful to have around, provided
    they are confined to the barbarian lands). So the deep state has been forced to
    makes compromises. Those compromises have upset true believers. Now the deep state
    itself is fractured and confused. In such difficult times, they dont want to turn
    around and repeal the law and have a new crisis on their hands. Christians and
    Ahmedis are relatively powerless \"little people\"..Such risks will not be taken
    on their behalf. They will continue to live under this threat for the foreseeable
    future. About the self immolation, keep in mind that we are talking about a
    society where you can actually find someone willing to set themselves on fire
    in exchange for money. Do not underestimate the extent of the misery of the poor
    in Pakistan (or India, for that matter). We are part of the criminally corrupt
    upper classes, now richer than ever before, what is boiling below is frequently
    invisible to us."

  content: Blasphemy laws should be there but the ambiguities in them should be removed.
    Anyone who is found using them for his/her own personal gain should be given strict
    punishment. Moreover, using blasphemy as a source to target minorities is a crime
    against teachings of Islam. It is time that we understand the reason why blasphemy
    laws were created at first place and their importance in creating a society free
    of hate-speech. The amendments introduced by Zia needs to be looked again and
    any loopholes shall be removed from them.

  content: "Thanks for putting up this tragic but useful time-line. Of course, it
    should be read together with another list referring to the Ahmadi Muslims. And
    a third list referring to the Shi'ah Muslims. who too have been targets of sectarian
    fanaticism for some time. Recall the 62 Shi'ah doctors killed in Karachi in one
    year.  There is much grandstanding going on. Gov. Taseer could have ordered
    an inquiry into the job done by the police in this case. He could have gone to
    Shekhupura and met with the accusers and the children and husband of Aasiya Bi.
    Instead he went to the jail to meet with her, and then introduced prematurely
    the matter of a presidential pardon. That gave an excuse to all the fanatics to
    come out full blast.   Thankfully, many more voices challenging the oppression
    are now available in the media. In Urdu, many columns in Aajkal, Express, and
    even Jang have expressed sane views with urgency. In English, Dawn, Express Tribune,
    and Daily Times have constantly published editorials and columns. Incidentally,
    a recent column by Yasser Hamdani in the Daily Times was particularly good in
    exposing how Jinnah's name was being used by fanatics in this matter."

  content: "I suppose middle aged people from the sub continent, like myself, tended
    to be complacent about an eventual course correction in this regard, but perhaps
    this is because we are out of touch with young people- late teens, early twenties-
    especially those completing professional or technical courses who are sure to
    play a vanguard role in the coming decade. What has happened, while our attention
    was distracted by the headlines, is a reduction in linkages across communities
    for young people.  The result is you have the sort of situation Satre depicted
    in 'the childhood of a leader'- a young man gains a sort of materiality, an authenticity,
    he turns into 'a regular guy', a 'good egg' by confessing- 'no doubt, I'm a bit
    of a nutcase, but say what you like, I enjoy shouting 'la'nat on those Shias'.' The
    odd thing is he can continue to revere the poetry of Ghalib and listen to the
    Qawwalis of Aziz Mian. What is frustrating is that there's no real counter-argument
    we can offer. You can confute conspiracy theories, you can engage in theological
    debate- but when a young man with clear eyes and a robust body tells you shouting
    \ la'nat' is fun, it feels good, anyway it's not harmful to the health like smoking
    or drinking, so it's my choice, my freedom- what is one to do? The younger
    generation did not create this problem. An older generation- generally free of
    sectarian prejudice- had instrumentalized communal violence for narrow political
    ends.  Bhutto brings in the anti-Qadiani legislation. His executioner sponsors
    the Sipah e Sahaban. What is next? Full scale hostilities between Bahrelvis and
    Deobandis? Across the border in India, Bahrelvis are feeling neglected because
    the minority gets more attention from the Govt.  These things can spill over.
     How is the rising generation to be educated to meet these challenges?"

---
<p>1. According to the 1998 census, there are slightly more than 2 million Christians (1.59% of total population) distributed roughly equally across urban and rural areas. As a minority the Christian community in Pakistan is predominantly located in the province (state) of Punjab. Although sizeable communities are found in the cities of Quetta, Karachi and Peshawar as well.<br />
1a. <a href="http://therepublicofrumi.com/archives/liaquat19490309.htm">The Objectives Resolution of 1949</a> stated that in the Republic of Pakistan "adequate provision shall be made for the minorities freely to profess and practise their religions and develop their ultures;" The Objectives Resolution was made the preamble in the 1973 Constitution. The word "freely" was removed.</p>
<p>2.	The Church of Pakistan was amalgamated from Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican churches in 1970. </p>
<p>3.	The earliest recorded attack on Christian communities was in 1952, when a family of 7 were burned alive in the village of Matti. The criminals were caught, prosecuted and hanged.</p>
<p>4.	During the first two decades of Pakistan, Christian communities were largely integrated. They had a political party and in the 1951 and 1954 elections, they won four seats (each) in the local Punjab Assembly.</p>
<p>5.	The 1973 Constitution of Pakistan declared that &ldquo;Islam shall be the state religion of Pakistan&rdquo; and restricted minority participation in government and politics. </p>
<p>6.	General Zia ul Haq took over the state through a military coup in 1977 and the hung the deposed Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1979. He also undertook a strict policy of &ldquo;Islamization&rdquo; through which laws and practices in the country were to brought in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence. Some of the most damaging new laws fell under the rubric of &ldquo;Blasphemy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>7.	In 1980, he introduced Section 298-A under the Martial Law Ordinance which criminalized derogatory remarks against the earliest leaders in Muslim history, as well as the family and friends of the Prophet Muhammad. Section 298-B & C focused on disrespect to the holy book Qur'an as well as the declaration of apostasy towards the community of Ahmadis (a sect within Islam).</p>
<p>8.	Section 298-A: Use of derogatory remarks etc. in respect of Holy Personages: </p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representations, or by any imputation, innuendo, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of any wife or members of the family of the Holy Prophet or any of the righteous Caliphs or companions of the Holy Prophet shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine or with both</p></blockquote>
<p>9.	Section 295-B: Defiling etc. of copy of Holy Quran</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever willfully defiles, damages or desecrates a copy of the Holy Quran or of an extract therefrom or uses it in any derogatory manner or for unlawful purpose shall be punishable with imprisonment for life.</p></blockquote>
<p>10.	Section 295-C: Use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet.</p>

<p>11.	Furthermore, in 1980, General Zia ul Haq by constitutional amendment created the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) through Article 203-D which had the following powers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Court may, either of its own motion or on the petition of a citizen of Pakistan or the Federal Government or a Provincial Government, examine and decide the question whether or not any law or provision of law is repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam, as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet, hereinafter referred to as the Injunction of Islam.</p></blockquote>
<p>12.	In 1990, the FSC concluded that the &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo; under Section 295-B and 295-C was unjust punishment according to Islamic law. The Sections were amended so that the only penalty remained was the death penalty.</p>

<p>16.	A series of terrorist attacks occurred in 2001 and 2002 against Christian establishments, perhaps as a result of Pakistani cooperation with United States in the war in Afghanistan: In October 29th, gunmen killed 16 Christians in the St. Dominic Roman Catholic Church near Multan. A grenade attack on International Presbyterian Church in Islamabad on March 17th, 2002 killed five and injured 40.
