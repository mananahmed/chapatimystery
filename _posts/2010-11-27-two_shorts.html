  content: Thanks for the post.  I'd very much like to watch the Pandeya film but
    the link doesn't work and Googling didn't turn up anything.  Is there another
    link through which the film can be viewed?

  content: i remember pupul jaykar mentioning that originally the hinglaj peetha had
    a priestess and men were not allowed into the shrine. but when i looked at her
    book "the earth mother" she mentions hinglaj and its possible links with the indus
    valley civilization and mesopotamia , but no mention of a priestess. now there
    is a proper male pujari who is onviously not a nath yogi or tantric. what happened?

<p>To the many "Pakistan" related things clamoring for your desensitized attention, may I add a couple more?</p>
<p>I. Artist and film-maker Sophiya Pandeya travels to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=safari&q=hingol+balochistan&ie=UTF8&hq=Hingol+National+Park&hnear=Hingol+National+Park,+Awaran,+Balochistan,+Pakistan&z=9">Hingal, Baluchistan</a> and visits "Nani Mandir" of Hinglaj Mata. This darshan tale is touching, illuminating and worthy of your time. You can watch it below. You can also see a picture gallery <a href="http://offroadpakistan.com/pictures/hingol_2005/">from KO</a> of a trip to the same Park.</p>

<p>II. <a href="http://sastimasti.wordpress.com/">Sasti-Masti</a> is a short made by director Ahmer Naqvi aka Karachikhatmal. A homage to Lollywood, to Lahore, to  Ji-woon Kim's <em>Bittersweet Life</em>, it works wonderfully on many registers - not the least being the tongue-in-cheek one. </p>
