  content: "\" I want to survive or not-survive, in a just and ethical way.\"   On a different  note I wonder if you have
    seen this analysis of historical upheavels by Prof Turchin published sometime
    in 2012. The three historical markers of impending upheavels, namely multitudes
    of elites, misery of masses and unprecedented Governmental Debts.  http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic951425.files/Peter%20Turchin%20Paper.pdf"

<p>As a visually-read Muslim and an immigrant, I stand alongside many others who contemplate a precarious and hostile future in United States. There are many reasons, and I am sure you know most, for the threat that Trump's presidency holds for all of us. I know it will be very difficult and unbelievable and racist and sure, many are telling us that we will survive. But. I want to survive or not-survive, in a just and ethical way.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will increase manifold the mass-deportations that Obama-- some <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/31/u-s-immigrant-deportations-declined-in-2014-but-remain-near-record-high/">2.4 million</a> the majority of which were 'non-criminal'-- has maintained throughout his tenure.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will intensify Obama's drone war and assassinations of military-aged men in Pakistan or Somalia or Yemen. Trump will perhaps break the "city" barrier and those drones will fall on multi-story homes inside densely packed Karachi or Islamabad's subruban bungalows.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will close Refugee Settlement plans from allies and victims of Iraq, Libya, Syria or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will ask that Muslims inside America "do more", starting with mandatory registrations so that their whereabouts are known and accounted for-- akin to George W. Bush's "National Security Entry-Exit Registration System" of Sep 2002 which targeted students and workers from "terror-prone countries". (I remember my visit to security services and I remember friends who were picked up and never came back.)</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will increase surveillance on Muslims like the NYPD's decade long <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program">program</a>. There is also no doubt that surveillance of data-traffic will be the first increment.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will make the path to citizenship harder or impossible for those same people.</p>
<p>We can be sure Trump will introduce legislations against veiling, against political mobilization and other 'Un-American" activities.</p>
<p>We can be sure that Guantanamo will remain open and be re-populated.</p>
<p>In other words, let us not start with a notion that this is some great new rupture in the history of US or the world. Trump will not invent new tortures, new discriminations, new horrors. He will merely continue or expand what has happened for decades here. In fact, we even know Trump from countless roles outside of United State-- from Afghanistan, Philippines, Pakistan, Nicragua, etc.-- known as our "strong man".</p>
<p>I grew up in Doha Qatar where, as an immigrant, my father and our family had no rights, no protections and no shield from draconian police state. I went to college in Pakistan's Zia ul Haq where once during a simple reading of the daily newspaper, a dear friend cautioned me not to say General Saab with a mocking tone or else he would feel compelled to break our friendship. I was undocumented for many long years in United States.</p>
<p>As a scholar and a digital humanist, I have studied and written and thought about both the technologies of oppression and the technologies of resistance. This very site is a testament to some of those acts which emerged as the country willfully and forcefully invaded Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>What we cannot do-- is grant any space-- intellectual or material-- to isolation. We cannot survive by keeping quiet and minding our business. We cannot survive by looking out for only our interest and our concerns. We do live in perilous times, but it is incumbent on all of us to remember that the bombs have fallen elsewhere even as we loved Obama. That our victories for civic freedoms came exactly as we gave billions in military aid to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Money, power and prestige that links bombings in Yemen, migrant workers on football stadiums and Shi'a in Bahrain. Let's not pretend that our solidarities in Ferguson and Staten Island absolve us from casting our eyes elsewhere. As Malcolm X once said, "If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad". So pay attention to fellow intellectuals who are fighting for the same rights around the world. Resist not only the domestic policies by writing against them or canvassing against them but also global and climate policies.</p>
<p>There are solidarities which will matter and there are modes of being, writing, thinking and doing that will protect us and our loved ones. This site, like many others, will be a place for your thoughts and our techniques of engagement. We who can write, will write, and we who can march, will march, and we who can sing, will sing. Do our best to think outside the nation-state. Connect through distributed means. Look to our peers in India and Turkey. Create, or join, new cultural spaces; know that those domains of irony, pleasure, satire, and laughter will never succumb and cannot be subverted.</p>
<p>All this accompanies the daily task of being scholars, students, thinkers, artists, workers, lovers, fathers and mothers. Faiz Ahmed Faiz, in prison, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as now,<br />
since forever,<br />
have people tangled with<br />
oppressors</p>
<p>nor are their customs new<br />
nor are our ways new</p>
<p>Just as now,<br />
since forever,<br />
have we blossomed flowers<br />
in fire,</p>
<p>nor is their defeat new<br />
nor is our victory new</p></blockquote>
<p>(You can see Faiz recite this full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ6JNMKfwFM">poem</a>.)</p>
<p>I do not quote Faiz to suggest hope and optimism. Only to indicate that the hard work of surviving is continuous historically and throughout our past. In this, we can learn and grow.</p>
