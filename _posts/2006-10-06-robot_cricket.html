<p>The word around the cricket ground was that Abdul Qadir did not have bones in his wrists - rather greased metal balls that allowed him 360&Atilde;&euro;&Atilde;&para;of motion. And then, the same is said of Shane Warne, whose <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=aYzH1R36D_k">Ball of the Century</a> inspired Dr. Andy West [winner of the <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/mm/research/sports-engineering/Staff_Pages/West.htm">Stoner prize</a> - heh heh] to create a <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/news79359101.html">robotic bowler</a> that will &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;mimic Warne, McGrath or the style of any other bowler."
