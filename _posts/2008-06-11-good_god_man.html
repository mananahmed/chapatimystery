    lie\" kills me; oh, please, do speak truth to power Tom, do, please defend the
    republic with clear-sighted insight and hard-headed analysis.  \r\n\r\nActually
    I read most of it. Hard not to galk at a roadside accident, even if it makes you
    feel yucky afterwards."

  content: "I thought Friedmans' column was OK.  It's the good part of breathy American
    exceptionalism. Go Team!\r\n\r\nAnd though Obama isn't Muslim, but he is a member
    of your country's major minority -- like Copts in Egypt, Shias in Saudi (the Bahai-Iran
    thing is wrong though -- should be Azeri -- which has already happened). Possibly
    Catholics in the UK (Blair only converted after he resigned).\r\n\r\nCan you imagine
    a Sindhi leading Pakistan?  Impossible.  That's why America is exceptional!"

  content: "Sadly no, Ikram. Friedman is not setting up 'minority rules' argument
    - he is setting up Muslim in the White House. \r\n\r\n\"While Obama, who was raised
    a Christian, is constantly assuring Americans that he is not a Muslim, Egyptians
    are amazed, excited and agog that America might elect a black man whose father&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    family was of Muslim heritage. They don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really understand
    Obama&acirc;&euro;&trade;s family tree, but what they do know is that if America
    &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; despite being attacked by Muslim militants on 9/11 &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name &ldquo;Hussein,&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    it would mark a sea change in America-Muslim world relations.\"\r\n\r\nThe example
    para I cited in the post doesn't highlight ethnic, or racial minorities - it highlight
    RELIGIOUS minorities: Shia, Copts, Baha'i. Friedman's rhetorical point is exactly
    that Obama is analogous to them. Oh, except he ISN'T.\r\n\r\nIn any case, a Sindhi
    (and a Shi'a) have already led Pakistan, twice. The Bhuttos."

    the worst in op-ed page concern trolling; between this one and Applebaum and Lutt-whack
    it's like the perfect storm trifecta of stupid."

  content: "You still pissing on Freidman when you write:\r\n\r\nIf a Shiite cannot
    become the leader of Saudi Arabia than a Muslim cannot lead United States either.
    Okay? Do you have a functional brain??\r\n\r\nOr do you mean to say America wouldn't
    elect a Muslim president because Islams are kind of scary?\r\n\r\nIf you're saying
    that the U.S. hates Muslims like Saudi hates Shia, I have to call shenanigans
    on you. A Muslim <i>could</i> certainly be president: Article VI, section 3, and
    states: &ldquo;...no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification
    to any office or public trust under the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe probability
    of the United States having a Muslim president is quite low for now. Yet, many
    of the framers, who were aware of the difference between the words \"religious\"
    and \"creedal,\" did not likely intend the United States executive to be <i>anything,</i>,
    least of all Christian. We've already reached the point where Mormons and Jews
    can make serious claims to electability to high office; Muslims <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-23-american-muslims-cover_x.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">may not be far behind</a>. In contrast, the Saudi monarchy, which
    probably does not include many Shi'a, can blow me.\r\n\r\nOh, and Barack Obama
    is a Protestant Christian; we should end every missive so, just as Cato ended
    every speech to the Senate with <i>Carthago delenda est</i>!"

  content: "Oh, and Ikram, America's population breaks down thus:\r\n\r\nWhite: 73.9%
    or 221.3 million\r\nLatino/a: 14% or 44 million\r\nBlack or African American:
    12.2% or 37.1 million\r\nAsian: 4.4% or 13.1 million\r\nAmerican Indian or Alaska
    Native: 0.8% or 2.4 million\r\nNative Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander: 0.14%
    or 0.43 million\r\n\r\nIt's a common misconception that African Americans are
    America's biggest minority. They're not. With the exception of Native Americans,
    whose population at the time of Columbian contact has been reduced by probably
    90% or so (totally a genocide), African Americans have been the worst-treated
    of America's minorities, and thus have a special narrative foothold. Latinos/as,
    on the other hand, have generally been treated to a \"kind of like white guys\"
    status (consider that no one batted an eye when Cuban emigre Dezi Arnaz married
    and reproduced with Lucille Ball in the '50's). This is not to say that white
    people in Greenwich, Connecticut don't mistreat their Puerto Rican gardner. Just
    means it's a little more complicated than the easy binary calculations of white/not
    white that take place where African Americans are concerned."

  content: Fair enough, Farangi. I did mean that "America wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    elect a Muslim president because Islams are kind of scary?" And I take your point
    about there being no constitutional hurdle to a Muslim in the White House.

<blockquote>I just had dinner at a Nile-side restaurant with two Egyptian officials and a businessman, and one of them quoted one of his children as asking: &ldquo;Could something like this ever happen in Egypt?&rdquo; And the answer from everyone at the table was, of course, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; It couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t happen anywhere in this region. Could a Copt become president of Egypt? Not a chance. Could a Shiite become the leader of Saudi Arabia? Not in a hundred years. A Bahai president of Iran? In your dreams. Here, the past always buries the future, not the other way around.</p></blockquote>
<p>OBAMA IS NOT A MUSLIM!</p>
<p>If a Shiite cannot become the leader of Saudi Arabia than a Muslim cannot lead United States either. Okay? Do you have a functional brain??</p>
<p>Friedman's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/opinion/11friedman.html?partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">hilariously painful</a> column is - as usual - full of inanities but two points are worth yelling out aloud about. 1. American exceptionalism 2. American exceptionalism. </p>
<p>Thanks to Lapata for telling me not to read today's Friedman.</p>
