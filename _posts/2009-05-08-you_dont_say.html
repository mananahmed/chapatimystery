  content: "<i>Since moving to the United States, Mr. Haqqani has developed an affinity
    for American culture. He taught international relations at Boston University from
    2004 to 2008, and he roots for the Red Sox.</i>    Well that seals
    it for me - never trust a Red Sox fan LOL!  More seriously, have you had
    a chance to skim through his books Sepoy? I have heard it mentioned several times,
    without knowing who he was or his background and was curious to see what people
    think of it."

  content: "Well, he started off with the Islami Jamiat-e-Tulba (IJT), the notorious
    student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI)... he had a stint with the PML-N too,
    but now seems firmly entrenched in the PPP... quite an ideological ride, isn't
    it?  Nadeem Farooq Paracha accuses Haqqani, who won the top slot in the
    1979 student body election at Karachi University, of introducing sophisticated
    weaponry into Karachi University, a trend that soon caught on in the rest of Pakistan
    as well...  http://nadeemfparacha.wordpress.com/student-politics-in-pakistan-a-celebration-lament-history/  His
    shady past aside, he does seem to handle the press well...  By the way,
    it would be illuminating for everyone to share their encounters with the IJT on
    a separate thread... they have terrorized campus life in Pakistan for well over
    three decades... did I tell you about the time they shot one of their own point
    blank at my school?"

  content: Rather charmingly, CM presented me with a purple-tongued bibhatsa sepoy
    banner to accompany this post.  Perhaps it's trying to forecast a future as "catnip
    for American journalists, offering a mix of high-minded analysis and <strike>street-corner
    gossip.</strike>pop kulcha punditry?

    the US to install in Pakistan.

  content: It would make for interesting research  to see how people the NYT, WSJ,
    WAPO and the Hindu have  priased and recommended for Pakistan have actually turned
    out for Pakistan over the years.  Even more interesting would be to see the Pakistani
    intellectual community's reaction to these names and such coverage.

  content: "Haqqani is a very sharp and funny fellow, can say pretty outrageous things
    at times and I guess the journos like that. I met him a few times when he worked
    in DC and found him an odd mix of opportunist looking for influence/cash and journalist
    proud of having stood up to government goons, though not above making peace with
    the bosses who ordered the goons around. Much like political playas anywhere who
    crave access and influence, and as he really does know the Washington establishment
    well, you can see why he'd be a good choice for ambassador. Apparently the line
    he keeps repeating is \"we need to look forward, not backward.\"  As for
    being a media whore, am guessing he just did it for the money, was juggling a
    few other jobs too."

<p>Oh NYT, why do you always fall for those "<a href="http://nytimes.blogspace.com/genlink?q=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/09/world/asia/09envoy.html?hp">silver-tongued interpreters</a>".</p>
