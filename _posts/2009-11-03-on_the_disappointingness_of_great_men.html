It made me lose respect for the Booker, and now I fear I may lose respect for Orhan Effendi.  I had a plan to film a goat eating it, and post it to CM, but I couldn't find any unsupervised goats hanging around Palo Alto so I gave up on the project. Maybe she's funny?"

I'm loosing my respect for Mr.Pamuk who was crazy about her books... As for this smart and &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; ;-) lady, Pamuk is a very good advertisement for her... if she could become Mrs. Pamuk :), as Turkish press promised us all the summer. Well, let's forget literature at least all the Turkey knows how to kiss!"

Pamuk is a lucky man that she will have *him* (Great Writer, though he may be) and his devout fans should give him credit for knowing it."

  content: "Did none of you ever see this brilliant satirical piece by Kiran Desai
    in India Today, Dec. 26, 2005 ? The link is: http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20051226/guest-kiran.html  But
    here's the whole piece. Wow !!  The True Nature of the Beast Kiran Desai  (A
    tongue-in-cheek look at Indian-American writers as well as their desi counterparts)  A
    writer named Aloo arrives in America and gets embroiled in the debate on whether
    to continue saying tomAAto, or join the locals in saying tomAEto, or say tomAEto
    to locals and tomAAto to fellow desis. After the vast effort it has taken to surmount
    the US Embassy-which must count as one of the world's top 10 barriers along with
    the barbed wire of Gaza and the police of Lampedusa-poor Aloo tries all the 101
    ways to stay. However, to save his pride he throws his inconvenient sharam (shame)
    down the drain and replies when Americans ask as they always do, \"Are you planning
    to stay?\" \"No ...\" \"Why not?\"  \"My subject is there in India ...\" But
    the market is here. There are tastes that will never be quenched. For example,
    like the Pashmina shawl, the arranged marriage story will always be in season.
    While Aloo immediately begins to sell the book that will support him like stock
    in Coca-Cola, this product of India's finest education (that is, brought up to
    leave) tries to find the opposite of an arranged marriage to increase his status
    in his own eyes, get a green card plus someone who can rent a car at the drop
    of a hat and drive him to Canada with aplomb. When lucky Aloo finds this pale
    creature, he has an excuse to stay, and once he has a green card he can safely
    begin to proclaim his heritage and feel nostalgia instead of terror while thinking
    about his motherland. He becomes a martyr forced to leave, which adds complexity
    to his character and creates the impression that he is not a drab immigrant like
    the rest, but an exile. Exile is a forlorn, literary feeling and allows him to
    indulge in moods of elegant grey. Fulbrights and Guggenheims, lakeside conferences,
    a tenured platform from which to comment on his nation's relationship with the
    West, post-colonialism, India's nuclear programme ... he is like a fly in a box
    of laddoos. Only, he soon finds that he cannot stand the other flies among the
    laddoos and gets hysterically anxious on learning of each new desi writer's name.
    What if they usurp his position or get the same laddoos that would make his laddoos
    taste that much less good. \"Which Indian authors do you like?\" asks every journalist.
    Aloo says he does not read Indians and names Kawabata and Turgenev. \"No Indians?\"
    Pressed, he mentions the dead or dying. \"I admire R.K. Narayan.\" \"Rushdie?\" Oh
    no. There was that red-letter day when Salman Rushdie proclaimed that the best
    work out of India was being done in English-and they condemned him harsher than
    did the Ayatollah, whether out of indignation or oedipal fervour, it was hard
    to tell. Aloo immediately adopts the politically correct position and says Indian
    writers writing in regional languages are the best. Such as Mahashweta Devi. She
    does not write for the West. She is pure. Thus Aloo kills two birds with one stone:
    he does not help a competitor and comes off a patriot. He is just about to relax
    a little when Arundhati Roy with a love-across-caste-lines book does even better
    than Aloo did with his arranged marriage book, and goes on record to say that
    unlike the fancy fake pants that abound (like Aloo), she is the authentic product
    with an authentic Indian address, and without privilege-a claim that is hotly
    disputed. You are in the club. I'm not in the club. You ARE. No-you spoke
    English, ate macaroni and sold yourself to the West just like the rest of us. I
    am not privileged-I grew up poor and alone, dark and female. (This is a mantra
    that unlocks many a door. Shout, \"Brave Third World woman overcoming all odds,\"
    and you'll get to leap in the air and earn a million). Never was someone more
    adamantly invited to take a seat in the club. Never has it been so resisted. Aloo's
    wife can't understand the fight about who owns the Indian subject. Who owns India?
    The wife thinks everyone does. Aloo thinks all desis do. The desi writers writing
    in English in India think all desis living in India do. The writers writing in
    regional languages think they do, not the ones writing in English.  One
    morning, it's inevitable; Aloo acquires his own personal enemy. Someone from a
    small town in India he has never met has posted a hate note about Aloo's work
    as seen in the light of his current address, and all his well-meaning friends,
    expressing horror (not really), send it on. When Aloo's new book comes out, the
    critic cuts off his head on samachar.com. \"Desis abroad are rotten-bad-egg-bastards
    with no talent except for the shabby talent of prostituting themselves to the
    West.\" The critic must have defined a larger hate for Aloo, for the critic becomes
    popular. \"English is a foreign tongue and can never accurately portray the Indian
    reality,\" the critic writes in English. A year later, the man who hates Aloo
    is writing for England. He has caught the eye of an editor from the Times who
    likes to know the story behind the story. \"Indian writers writing in English
    are privileged, come from Doon School and St. Stephen's, go to Oxford and Cambridge.
    They are not really Indian.\" \"You know how they are in India,\" says Aloo's
    sister in Ohio, when he calls her to complain. \"You are sitting here getting
    invited to parties, eating smoked salmon and flying off to France-it bugs the
    hell out of them,\" she says. Meanwhile, just to make things more difficult, V.S.
    Naipaul, who has just been given the Nobel Prize for literature, returns the favour
    by announcing that the novel is dead. The next year he writes a novel and that
    year he doesn't announce that the novel is dead. The year after, the novel is
    dead again. After 9/11, Americans agree. It's in the papers. Fiction cannot
    have the weight of non-fiction. Terrorists may have no shoes but they have raised
    the oil prices, they are running circles around George Bush and the novel, both
    amazed to be keeping each other company. Aloo reads Stein and Beckett to escape
    his horrible world-they didn't face 9/11, only World Wars, the holocaust, poverty,
    but that didn't kill their novels. There is joy here. And madness. Aloo howls
    that night at the full moon. Brilliance creates desire for brilliance. Only
    the sublime novel can create the need for a novel ... Funnily, the cowbelt critic
    agrees with Aloo. It turns out he has an ulterior motive. The real thing will
    come along, he writes, and the real thing happens to be himself. The critic reveals
    he has just finished a novel on an authentic India--a torrid love affair between
    a white girl and an Indian boy against the backdrop of India's finest tourist
    locations. On BBC radio, they ask Aloo, Why are you writing of India while
    living in the West? Scared, Aloo answers that art has no address, look at James
    Joyce, Henry James, look at Rohinton Mistry, who has lived abroad and yet can
    exactly describe the bathroom problems of an ageing Parsi gentleman in Mumbai.
    Methinks thou dost protest too much, says the BBC lady's sceptical eyebrow. Aloo
    gets the distinct feeling that she, too, would rather he returned to India and
    solved the West's immigrant problem. The farce continues-when the real thing
    happens. The tsunami strikes and 2,75,000 souls are dead. It even drowns out news
    of two marines killed in Iraq on the front page of the American papers. The South
    Asian Journalists Association rises to the occasion and organises an Indian Writers
    Read to Raise Money for the Tsunami Night. Hundreds of desis attend. Aloo, in
    the interest of being authentic, now says tomAAto, no matter who he's speaking
    to. He is dressed in an achkan and has begun looking at real estate in Goa to
    counter the cowbelt critic with irrefutable proof of desire to return. Aloo reads.
    Magic realism has become a dirty word, so Aloo has replaced an elephant with a
    dog and has removed a beggar, for it feeds the preconceived ideas of India as
    a land of beggars. He is boring, but boring is ... authentic. The next reader
    climbs the stage. Aloo blinks at the name announced--No! Surely not ... But it's
    him-the objective critic-turned-writer from the cowbelt! He has hopped over the
    insurmountable barrier of the US Embassy. Over the great barrier of the British
    Embassy. He opens his mouth and spouts a fancy pants English accent--he must have
    caught it like the flu, or else he was practising in the cowbelt a long time ago,
    plotting, planning. Aloo runs to catch him, this man who has ruined his life,
    but he's a master at slipping away. He has gone in a flash into the western world
    he wished to save from Aloo and keep for himself. He has gone away from this event
    held for those so poor they will never read or write at all-away he flies ...
    the only fly in the box of laddoos now. On the other side of the world, the
    sun rises on another young writer in India, who is getting really mad. He is going
    to pick up his pen and he's going to tell the world the true nature of the beast.
    We know the story. It's an old Indian story. One that has never been sold to the
    West.  (The writer is the author of Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard.)"
