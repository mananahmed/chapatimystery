    ill be honest with you. i do recall seeing a falcon on a plane in the gulf once or twice. but it was just a single bird tethered to a perch... not "cages full of sqauwking falcons".



    if you want to see some more Orientalism then check out this beauty:

    it would seem that Ms. Zoepf is referencing that NYer article a while back which made the claim that *because* of [insert forgotten Middle-East-based airline here]'s extensive drop-down menu of titles (including, but not limited to: Dowager, Sheikh, and Rear Admiral (Upper Half)), its passengers must be accordingly worthy of such-ranked designation.



    she does not, however, seem to have made it to the conclusion of said article, in which it was also noted that Amtrak, too, boasted a remarkable myriad of honorifics (including suffixes!) in the ticket-sales portion of its website.

  content: She does say "the idea" conjures. Doesn't that sort of buttress Said's
    thesis, and by extension, Sepoy's? Also, let's not be too hasty. Without Orientalism
    I would have no sexual fantasies of any kind. Humbly yours,

  content: "...odd, too, because this is the same k. zoepf who's done some good and
    sensitive reporting from syria in the past, esp. on the kurds; as well as probably
    the only article on the issue of the assyrian christian minority in southern turkey
    that i've seen in the mainstream US press.  also she was a college classmate of
    dear S., who has said nice things about her.  lord knows what prompted the above-quoted
    flights of fantasia, but she's not just some dim orientalist on a two-week press
    junket in dubai."

  content: You know, I did google around for Ms. Zoepf and found nothing as inane.
    Hence, I addressed my rant to NYT. That paper is losing its mind.

<p>What in tarnation is wrong with you? Forget the whole Clinton marriage thing that you just "covered". Forget even the earth-shaking headline today, "Terror Fears Hamper U.S. Muslims' Travel". No Duh! Just explain to me <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/travel/01webletter.html?ex=1306814400&en=de0edd882620fa65&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">this piece</a> by Katherine Zoepf which is so over-the-top with inanities that the only response I have is a blogrant:</p>
<p>Look at the opening lines: <i>"There was a time, not long ago, when the idea of jet travel in the Persian Gulf countries conjured up images of white-robed sheiks accompanied by cages full of squawking falcons and of European oil executives lounging in first-class luxury &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg; of a frequent-flier population more at home with a large entourage than a humble rolling suitcase."</i></p>
<p>Dear Ms. Zoepf, when was that magical time? During the Abbasid Caliphate? On Aladdin's flying carpet? Because I have flown in and out of the Persian Gulf since 1975 and I don't -EVER- recall any abundantly garbed <i>sheikhs</i> with falcons. Have you been watching one too many re-runs of Lawrence of Arabia? And then you go on and find a quote from someone who, supposedly, does travel in Arabia.</p>
<blockquote><p>David Bender, a graduate student in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University who often travels throughout the Arab world, said that while in Damascus during Ramadan last fall, he had been surprised to see billboards over the Syrian capital's main traffic circles advertising special fares to the United Arab Emirates for Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of the Islamic fasting month.</p>
<p>"It's been interesting to see advertisements encouraging people to spend the Eid in Dubai, on vacation; this suggests that there must be a middle class who can afford that kind of thing," Mr. Bender said."</p></blockquote>
<p>It <i>suggests</i> to Mr. Bender that there might be some kind of <i>middle class</i> that might, you know, need/enjoy/desire/consume <i>that kind of thing</i>. Because, lord knows that Mr. Bender in his travels throughout the Arab world has not seen anyone besides sheikhs, their falcons, and Mr. Hammond from Exxon. </p>
<p>WHERE do they find these people!?? </p>
<p>Yeah. I stopped reading after that. Do let me know if the parade of Orient's indelible imagery ever stopped.</p>
