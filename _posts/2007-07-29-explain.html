  content: I don't think that the cartoonist thinks of Buddhists are brown - the other
    guy is probably supposed to be yellow. No, I think it's because of his ignorance.

  content: I don't think that ethnicity has much to do with it, especially as these
    days, Buddhism tends to often be associated with vapid, upper-middle class white
    people.

  content: "Maybe I missed something, but how is the above cartoon associated with
    Buddhism? Because it could be Hindu...\r\n\r\nPerhaps:\r\n\r\n1. Depicting Westerners
    as rational and dealing with the material world's matters (man who comes to inquire
    about something with a briefcase in hand), whereas the Easterner (dressed in swami
    attire, sitting down on the ground and chanting some obscure mantra in English)
    is more spiritual and abstract. And then, by extension...[see #2]\r\n\r\n2. Critique
    on Hindu/Buddhist philosophy, which is \"I renounce everything, I have chosen
    to become inactive, I give up living and life, I disengage myself from the material
    world since it is all maya anyway, and I will mentally cocoon myself in order
    to spiritually perfect myself.\"\r\n\r\nI am probably totally off the base here,
    as I am wont to do :)"

  content: "I don't think it has anything to with brownity. But I'd lean closer to
    #2 suggested above. Desi Italiana, you do realize who the cartoon is about I presume?
    (lying sack of partisan flesh --oh, and and attorney general for Bush-- Alberto
    Gonzales)\r\n\r\nThe cartoon could have easily been directed at Libby or others.
    I would say that it is poking fun at Buddhist trendiness in the US by comparing
    Gonzales' adamant refusal to take part in the reality everyone else seems to be
    experiencing with the new-agey yuppie religion trends. To me the robes look less
    Buddhist than Hare Krishna, but chalk it up to ignorance or a deliberately generic
    portrayal."

  content: "Nate:\r\n\r\n\"Desi Italiana, you do realize who the cartoon is about
    I presume?\"\r\n\r\nI KNEW I was going to be off the mark somehow! And sure enough,
    when I read your comment, yes, I now see I missed the little part of the cartoon
    where it says \"Attorney General.\" My bad [am slightly blushing out of embarressment].\r\n\r\n\"To
    me the robes look less Buddhist than Hare Krishna\"\r\n\r\nYup. Same here.\r\n\r\nBut
    speaking of Buddhist trendiness in the US, the impression that I get living in
    the Bay Area is more that Hinduism is trendy (but then again, Tibet is a fashionable
    hot \"cause\" right now in Berkeley which supporters can endorce by activist consumption.
    Buddhism and Hinduism are definately pushed here). There's a lot of Hare Krishna
    individuals and forces (many of whom are, I have noticed, German converts) that
    are flocking passerbys in front of Indian restaurants, trying to get people to
    convert."
