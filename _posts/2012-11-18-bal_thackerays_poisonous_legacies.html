  content: Just another attempt to target ShivSena/BJP for its role in protecting
    Hindus in the 1993's riots. This article is indeed written in bad taste, sponsored
    by Congress, to please Pakis &amp; Muslims.

  content: No sane person can defend Thackeray, let alone eulogize him. That he was
    not brought to books, and remained scot-free is a blot on our polity and tells
    a lot about our law treats people differently.

  content: Bal Thackeray went to his end wrapped up in the Indian tricolor flag. Surprising,
    because he went against what the country and the constitution stands for. He was
    against the rights of an Indian citizen living and working anywhere in India.
    He was a narrow provincial rabble rousing character, completely negative in his
    politics who promoted violence to reach his political goals. He eschewed everything
    that is reasonable, liberal, cosmopolitan and good. I for one am not mourning,
    even though out tradition tells us not to bad mouth the dead. Needless to say
    many have seen their deaths because of this guy. Hope he finds his peace on the
    other side.

  content: Finally !!! Someone has the guts to really say it like it is. You cannot
    make a hero out of a man who admires hitler oh no! This man hasn't earned my respect
    nor has he earned it by the millions of mumbaikers who sit at home today out of
    fear or because of the snowballing effect put to play by the media and cops to
    stay indoors. I just hope these maniacs don't sit to discuss to have an holiday
    next year on his death anniversary. It's a disgrace. Truly is.

  content: "Honoring thackeray by giving him a state funeral shows that as democratic
    society we have bid goodbye to convention and the basic concept of propreity.
    \ \r\n\r\nthackeray was no chief minister, nor was he a part of any government.
    \ the police bandobast was essential no doubt; but what about the gun salute,
    the wrapping of the corpse with tricolor?  Could these have not been avoided?\r\n\r\nDemocracy
    requires education.  Education should evolve the mind and develop profound common
    sense.  In a nation which rewards demagoguery and kowtows to parallel centres
    of power, what can you expect?"

  content: How come no one writes any blog on how Indians feel when India used to
    loose cricket match against Pakistan, the Muslims of Mumbai used to celebrate
    and distribute sweets in Bhendi bazaar, Mohammed Ali road. Why no one complained
    about how this mullahas tried to instigate violence blocking traffic in Mumbai
    for friday prayer. When congress leader like DIGVIJAY calls OSAMA as OSAMAJI and
    condemns that OSAMA a terrorist was not given any respect. Pseudo intellects like
    this one, arundhati roy are nothing but hypocritical cowards, who are too afraid
    to call spade a spade. And that is what BALASAHEB did he was courageous enough
    to call out cowards of this nation.

  content: I think some of his views were correct, but his actions may not be. His
    stance on illegal migrants was correct, that illegal migrants should be sent to
    their respective countries. But our leaders welcome them with open arms and make
    them legal citizens of country. As a result, today state of assam is burning.The
    day would come soon when we would have to be a minority in our country and these
    illegal migrants will rule our country.

    assassinated.He remained in his hotel room assuming that the offices would be
    closed.The government officials after  waiting for him finally reached his hotel
    room.It was explained to him that unlike India,USA does not shut down when a leader
    dies.\r\nA dean of a medical college in Kerala had a similar experience.When he
    was a student in UK,he was immersed in his work in the laboratory.After continuous
    and intense work with the microscope examining slides,he went to the window for
    a brief respite.He found the Union Jack at half mast and was told that the King
    died that day."

  content: What an intellectual mind!Mr.Gupta,you are too great to attempt tarnishing
    the image of a man who just passed away.Remember he was neither a coward ,nor  hypocritical.He
    was a man of masses,who made mistakes also &amp; admitted them.He was not hiding
    in any American university .He knew that finally only son /religion of the soil
    will prevail. The pseudo intellect that you represent is only good for people,who
    read history  without understanding the same.Your type will never understand Shivaji,for
    you,he was only a man who fought against Muslims,using Guerrilla warfare .You
    are ignorant of the public mood,in Mumbai.You should be aware,that the history
    is created not by warming chairs,but by movements on road.it is not surprising
    that Japan &amp; partly Australia has banned Muslim religion

    Listen u fool.\r\n\r\nThackeray was a great personality.\r\nHe did not hate anyone
    but spoke for right of local marathis .\r\n\r\nMost of the S.indians would set
    up hotel and employ S.indians not marathis , same with others who set up industry
    but would not employ marathis....so he spoke out against it....that what a true
    leader does unlike the corrupt DMK, mayabathis etc ..they are only fooling ppl
    to gain power unlike thackeray. He did not accept CM post even when Shiv sena
    gained power..\r\n\r\nAs for muslims it was the hooligans and criminals among
    them that he spoke about....at least \r\nhe had the guts ...unlike congressi crooks
    like sharad pawar who used dawood ibrahim and his criminal network to make his
    money and stay in power."

    man you fanned hatred and had no love for our country.

  content: "This is quite possibly the worst article written and should be taken down
    immediately. This is clearly written by some bigoted communist who has conveniently
    forgotten the atrocities committed against the Hindus during the riots. This person
    intends to shed \"light\" on the Bala Sahebs and Shiv Sainiks actions during the
    said riots but will someone please shed light on what about the actions. Then
    you say he inspired hatred against various communities. If you study closely then
    Bala Saheb has always demanded a fair reservation for maharashtrians. And how
    is that unfair. Most of the developed countries have that policy in place. Its
    called giving the locals a fair chance(in case you are too blinded to understand).
    But again if you were a reasonable person you would have done a research on facts
    before writing such crap this article would have been a eulogy on the great man.
    \r\nAll said and done, this has only reinforced my long standing belief that we
    need many more Bal Thackerey's in todays times. Long live Bala Saheb !! I hope
    you come back coz this city and this country needs you."

    so are things happening that way and nothing more than that. He might have touched

  content: Admirably written! I'm flabbergasted how this man who caused so much grief
    to so many people is venerated in such fashion. He spent the better part of his
    life cocking a snook at the law and even after death, has succeeded in inconveniencing
    millions of ordinary Mumbaikars who had no access to food, transport or basic
    services on a Sunday. It's a shame that the Government is paralysed into allowing
    this state of affairs and of not instilling confidence in shopkeepers to open
    shop. It's a shame that so many leading journos, filmstars and other "eminent"
    personalities indulge in such despicable sycophany by eulogising this man and
    it's a disgrace on ourselves that we mutely bear out this drama, that cost all
    of us a day's worth of life at the very least, till it blew over.

    minded regarding these issues. I feel racism is on its peak in India itself, who
    as per its slogan everybody is same. they don't make differences regarding cast,color,
    creed, religion. Who was Bal Thakeray?\r\ni still wonder, y the hell the media
    is raising this issue.\r\nHe was a racist, he was the symbol of hatred. It was
    him who pointed out non-residents of Mumbai should b thrown out from the city.
    It was him, who wish to throw out the Beharis. Who are integral part of India.
    \r\nIndia is not just named after Mumbai. India is not named after Mumbai. India
    is not famous for just one state so called Mahrashtra. India has 28 states which
    consists of different aspects of people.\r\nIndia is called Incredible India because
    of having different cultures, tastes, religion, tradition, customs and placez.\r\nPlz
    excuse me..\r\nbut i can't even regret of his death, and i can't even say  RIP.\r\nTHAT'S

  content: Brilliant piece. No intelligent, educated Indian can dispute these fundamental
    facts. As a literate, political Maharashtrian, I can say that I'm embarrassed
    of how he represented the state and it's people. Everyone knows (but were too
    afraid to say) that Bal was an old crone - from from a "Tiger" of any kind - just
    a coward, surrounded by thugs, and protected by the lethargy of a weak and corrupt
    Congress govt, too busy making money to do anything else. very similar to the
    situation surrounding both Hitler and Mussolini at the beginning of their despotic
    careers. The great thing about this mans death, though, is that (like Stalin,
    who fabricated myths around himself), we shall see history devour him, like weeds
    that occupy a forgotten building. The fake glory that he built around himself
    will slowly vanish - leaving only the image of him as a brutal and greedy dictator
    with little else left to his name.

  content: Sympathy and respect has been forced out of people in Bombay ( I still
    love the name). Forcibly shutting down the city due to death of a politician is
    stupidity of the highest order. Why should students starve a day before their
    University exams ? Why should stone sbe pelted at taxis ? I wonder why not much
    attention has been drawn to his eccentricities. Balasaheb was a megalomaniac .
    He has left behind a legacy of hatred and delusion. Dailies were replete with
    pieces and pictures portraying him as a saintly figure. This shouldn't happen
    in a democracy. It is sacrilegious. I feel sorry for people who have lost their
    two days' daily wages.

    people are secretly joyous that he is no longer around to destroy what was once
    a great city. Why do people bring up Kashmiri Pundits every time you mention old
    Bal? That's a separate discussion and one should definitely have that, but some
    other time. Two wrongs don't make a right, fools.

    the Western India would have been full of MinorityCommunity vote banks &amp; at
    the mercy of the Pakistani/Congress/Muslim just like Bangladeshi infiltration
    in the east &amp; pakis in the north. Therefore, request this forum to give this
    a thought &amp; not merely repeat the views of Congress-sponsored-Media. And yes,
    FEAR works wonderfully with people to whom Words make no sense. FEAR also works
    wonderfully with people to whom HungerStrikes by Gandhians make no sense. Well,
    how many of u support the Pakistanis/Congress/Muslims? You may disagree with us...\r\nwww.jaimaharashtranews.com/en/maharashtra/mumbai-en/hang-kasab-immediately-thackeray/"

  content: "Firstly congratulations to the writer and I myself am a Maharashtrian.\r\n\r\nIt's
    sheer disgrace of what has happened at funeral of a fanatic. State honors, national
    flag, now they will ask for a memorial at Shivaji park, are you kidding me? Fear
    is NOT RESPECT dear supporters of Mr. Hitler. Two million blind followers makes
    me wonder where the hell they go when their party needs to win elections!! Just
    pure $#!T.\r\n\r\nBiggest fools is the entire machinery, the other parties, the
    administration, the well known personalities and those morons who don't have balls
    to keep their shops open. Mr. Fanatic has been personified by these fools. What
    the hell did he do for welfare of Marathi manoos?? Small kids barely able to hold
    their pants being given guts to yell at a shopkeeper to pull down the shutters?
    Marathi people living in heart of Bombay i.e. Girgaon and Dadar made to leave
    due to their disastrous situations and go to far flung suburbs just to come back
    everyday for work in same heart of Bombay! Was Mr. Fanatic doing anything to help
    them instead of making their blood boil with speeches spitting venom??? Did he
    even bother to change people's mindset and attitude towards taking even the lowest
    grade of work? To stop union-bazi and rather work hard to grow themselves? And
    for that matter the third class attitude of some of people in this community who
    are ahead to pull legs of people who they see progressing?\r\n\r\nMr. Fanatic
    and his goons did they have balls to beat the daylights out of well to do bhaiya's
    in city? Those sitting in high offices or for that matter those of likes of Kripashankar
    Singh or Sanjay Nirupam? Did they have balls to take Lalu Prasad Yadav or Nitish
    Kumar by their collar to curb the so called migrant menace?\r\n\r\nIt's disturbing
    to see that when very few good Maharashtrian's who do not support such fanatics
    and are vocal in protest; the other communities who have got beating in the past
    still sing to their tunes. This is DISGRACE.\r\n\r\nFor that matter all these
    followers of this fanatic don't support an Anna Hazaare but dignify a person who
    amplified communal riots. It's a big DISGRACE to Indians and this is death of
    democracy. Jai Hind."

  content: "Funny how the writer mentions the 'minority' like they bathe in milk,
    as the popular Hindi saying goes. It's funny how the 'minority' is termed just
    that by the media, instead of calling a spade a spade. It's as if uttering the
    word 'Muslim' will invite trouble. I wonder why, since the writer is so convinced
    that they are an entirely peace loving community. \r\n\r\nIf the writer can criticize
    a dead man, why not raise a finger at the living? I ask the writer this:  How
    come mosques, illegally built in the not so recent past, are allowed to stand
    in the way of progress and delay crucial projects, while the BMC won't bat an
    eyelid pulling down crosses that have stood for centuries? On a similar note,
    how are ancient Parsi Fire Temples and Churches sent demolition notices in Bandra
    for road widening work, while the mosque sitting bang in the centre of the road
    in Marine Lines is left alone. How come the ruling party allows Bangladeshi 'minorities'
    to infiltrate into our borders and then massacre the local Indians? How come video
    grabs taken of the minorities destroying public property, molesting women in uniform,
    snatching weapons away from the police and desecrating memorials at the recent
    riot at Azad Maidan fail to get them convicted? Has the writer ever had the constant
    flinging of bags of faeces thrown into the window of his ancestral home in Bandra,
    so that the local thugs, belonging to the 'minority', can seize the property for
    cheap? Has the writer ever protested to the slaughter of goats in public spaces,
    despite the fact that it might be disturbing to people of other faiths? How come
    walking your dog in certain areas could invite abuses while those same people
    won't think twice about tying their herd of goats outside your door step? How
    come mosques are allowed to blast their prayers numerous times a day, but for
    other faiths, even a single evening involving an audio system requires a police
    permit and what not? \r\n\r\nI'm not against any minority, heck, I belong one
    myself. All I want is uniformity across the board and when a rule applies to the
    majority, it better apply to the minority as well."

    regional muscleman (maybe just in and around Bombay) and all that praise, obituary
    that is being showered on a "glorified" mafia don is disgusting and nauseating
    at best. While, the Bombay page three celebrities, politicians of all hue, corporate
    media and film personalties who possess sub-human intellect, praising Thackeray
    is understandable, what is not understandable is the reaction of the so-called
    "educated, urban middle class" falling for the man. This guy made a political
    career by launching hate campaigns against his own "imagined" enemies, be it South
    Indians, North Indians, Muslims, Christians etc. If one were to trace the timeline
    of his life, he made convenient friends and foes as the situation demanded and
    then moved on to other. He represents to India, what Hitler and Mussolini represented
    to Germany and Italy. He was worst scum to ever float on the cess-pool of Indian
    political scene.

  content: "The only article by an Indian, at least in the English media, that says
    it like it is. The last few days reminded me of the time when after the Srikrishna
    commission's indictment of Thackeray there were rumours that he might finally
    be arrested. Within an hour, all of Bombay, including me, had ducked for cover
    - run away home - in fear of what was to come. \r\nI also remember the time when
    we'd helplessly watched 'live' on television the demolition of the Babri Masjid
    - there was never a more powerful feeling of shame. \r\nBy wrapping a murderer
    in the national tricolour this disgrace seems to have outdone all the past indignities
    - but then, perhaps its befitting - nationalism is a bloody affair, as we know
    from our human rights record in kashmir, the north east - all flags are sullied."

  content: "Superbly written. I'm sickened by the \"outpouring of grief\", \"adulation\",
    \"let's not speak ill of the dead\" and worse of all \"reminders of the good he
    did\", and using the numbers that showed up for his funeral as justification of
    his life and ways.\r\n\r\nDear Mumbai-ites: Hitler convinced the German population
    that the Jews were to blame for their economic problems. He convinced the German
    people of the need for \"Aryan pride\". He convinced them that his actions against
    Jews were really a \"response\", and were in fact \"necessary\". If he didn't
    do what he did, their children would be forever disadvantaged. He used a simple
    mind manipulation technique  - nothing unites a people more than when they believe
    they are constantly under attack and fighting a common enemy. He was a forceful
    orator and effective leader. He was the master of the politics of divisiveness.
    Millions idealized him. He has been credited with several achievements - anti-smoking,
    led development of an affordable car (volkswagen), revived the German economy,
    built the Autobahn etc. His supporters forever saw the good, and somehow, inexplicably,
    were blind to what the rest of the world saw. Had he died of natural causes in
    non-war time, millions would have turned up for his funeral, wrought with emotion,
    and waxed eloquently about his greatness. Sounds familiar? Someone who idealized
    him may have pulled off an encore to his life, half the world across, half a century
    later. Shame on us for not seeing through it. Those that ignore history, are doomed
    to repeat it."

    your valour for penning down your thoughts.Only difference is that the person
    whom you have described would have openly spoken about it rather than your stealth
    mode attitude.If I am wrong please check the statistics that describe his attitude
    as being the same from day one before he was in power.\r\n2)Appreciate Thackeray
    Sir only for the sake that he was one of the most excellent orators and crowd
    pullers of his time and could actually transform his life from being a simple
    middle class cartoonist to being one of the most influential persons which many
    entrepreneurs long for.Something which happens very rarely in a decade.\r\n3)I
    guess apart from the vandalism and public sentiments that he played with very
    wisely we youngsters should try to grab the attitude of his through which he could
    influence a complete society .As far as the facts and figures go we could definately
    have a debate and criticize or appreciate as per personal opinions."

    (as Mr. Rohit says).\r\n\r\nOr, as Mr. Hitesh feels that those asking for a fair,
    liberal society are bigots and morons! Ha! How delusional!\r\n\r\nAnd why do people
    think that ANY riots where ANY community was killed / bullied is any less disgusting?
    ('84 Sikh riots, Kasmiri pundits exodus). Since when did we start putting 'weight'
    on an Indian's life? Of course no one is condoni any of these acts of violence
    or barbarism! But do people realise that more often than not, these acts of violence
    have targeted one particular community? Why? Ever thought of that? In fact, a
    lot of these things go unreported. Assam violence was massive, yet was brushed
    away for the longest time. Why?\r\n\r\nQuestions our 'secular' citizens cannot
    answer. Media has done their role, in aiding the politicians' dirty vote bank
    agendas. And in the bargain, EVERYone is suffering. I wish people realise this,
    sooner than later, and unite in this cause, rather than being at the throats of

    degradation of Indian political discourse, what we also see is the triumph of
    cliche (and hence the death of thought): the same language, with perhaps occasional
    adjective changes, is used to describe anybody and everybody, be it Ambedkar or
    Thackeray, almost as if the convention of marking someone''s death has overtaken
    the reality of the kind of life lived.  I am reminded of sports commentary, where
    a number of commentators will say things like "beautiful stroke" for a slog sweep,
    a classic cover drive, or a lofted inside-out shot -- they are most interested
    in the fact that the shot has yielded four runs, and seem to lack the vocabulary
    or imagination to do anything but recycle words they have heard other commentators
    use.'

    just blindly followed him and made him a hero. Infact there are lots of hindus
    I know who faced huge problems due to Thakreys hatered.\r\nNot surprised but even
    media made him hero as they were scared of his threats (Gundagardi). What do u

    They were present b&acirc;&euro;&trade;cause they are scared of his terror. Otherwise
    what has he done for bollywood for them to be present there??\r\nFor people who
    think this article is wrong, xcuse me, but theres no favourism of Muslims or any
    other religion out here, author has just written about the riots which were related
    to Hindu -  Muslim.\r\nTalking about history, go and read real history from other
    countries about ancient India, and you will know what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the
    fact. History taught here in Indian schools are all fake. In fact kids of India

  content: "The kind of divisive politics Mr Thackeray played for power in India is
    not at all patriotic. It's meant to weaken the social structure and is build on
    convincing and emotionally charging ill-informed, less educated, under-confident
    masses about extremely short term goals. With time our politics (Mr Thackeray
    is a extreme example but it also includes congress and other parties) is build
    on protecting people and making them incomptent so that they always need to look
    at the goverment for livelyhood. That makes government extremely powerful and
    corrupt as we are seeing in India now.\r\nOver time meritocracy has really taken
    back seat in India and all people want reservations! Congress supports reservation
    to Minorities, special castes whereas Bal Thackey promoted reservation and protection
    of Marathis. \r\nIn my opinion the only criteria for any job or work or renumeration
    should be merit and only merit. It cannot be muscle power or the capability to
    create chaos or ability to harass. In an meritocratic society everyone will clearly
    know what it takes to achieve something and works hard to get it. If the only
    way to get jobs or do good for oneself is to compete in open exam and do better
    than other candidates or compete with other businesses in quality and services,
    then people with align to that. The ability to get jobs or do good for oneself
    cannot be based on \"voting out the fair people\" or creating rukus.\r\nI regret
    to say that most businesses and job opportunities in India are not based on fair
    competition or fair practices but they are based on relations, community and bribes.
    That is why you see the Mumbai or India the way it is. Mumbai has the worst roads
    and infrastructure in world among large cities (I have visited 33 largest cities
    in the world), while being equally expensive. It is not because govt does not
    assigned right budget for works but its because allocation of contracts and works
    is totally non-meritocratic, only based on relations and bribes.\r\nPeople in
    India are not dumb or incompetent but are being continuously misled into wrong
    goals. The same Indians are the richest ethnic people in USA. We have to understand
    and work towards a really fair, rich and powerful society. We currently choose
    to be led by leaders like Mr Thackeray or Ms Mamata, while being contended with
    living in a worse than medieval lifestyle of slums in Mumbai. It's not our destiny,
    it's not that we cannot do anything better. Its just that we do not have confidence
    and lack of fairness, protectionism and reservations have let us to where we are.\r\nWho
    needs protection or preferential treatment? \"It's the incompetent people\". Do
    people of India want to be counted in best people of world or among the \"incompetent
    people\"?\r\nOn the last note, bravery is not about beating helpless cab drivers,
    shop owners and creating nuisance. Lord Rama was brave because he was compassionate
    and while being fiercly competitive with the powerful people, he was extremely
    forgiving to the poor and helpless. People who beat powerless and helpless people
    are tyrants and cowards."

    Bal Thakre was there because of the support of the big bad Bollywood which is
    itself corrupt to the core and are amnuwadi manhoos from the core of their heart.
    And another thing Shiv Sena and MNS will ensure their untimely death.So Sharad
    Pawar is the future of Maharastra provided he comes back to Congress right now.

  content: A very good article indeed. Those who do not seem to like this write-up
    simply do not want to accept the truth. And those who do, are no 'bigoted' Communists.
    He is a product of History, of our failures. True, that one should not bad-mouth,
    the dead. But, one should not over-hype either. Indian Media has managed to amuse
    most of us in recent times. While Bal Thackeray spoke of 'identity', one cannot
    ignore the fact that it was based on the lines of pure 'hatred'. One should be
    open to see the other side of the story. Coming to Shivaji, he was the man who
    first spoke of a 'Hindu-Rashtra'. And that too was limited to Maharashtra. This
    is a fact, However, keeping this discussion beyond religion is necessary because
    some of us feel that 'All Muslims, Communists and Macaulay-ites are bad, and should
    therefore, be purged. Our history has seen a lot of bloodshed, and we seem never
    to realize it. We condemn it, but that too, lasts for a few days. We sit at home,
    watch TV, believing what we want to believe and what is fed to us. Never do we
    think that there could be another side to what is being fed. More importantly,
    just because we see the other side of a story, we are branded as 'intellectuals'.
    We are no 'intellectuals, we are 'wide-awake' or at least try to be 'wide-awake'
    and hence, we can see the other side of the story. To put an end to bidotry, dogmatism,
    regressive politics based on a regressive ideology, we must, first and foremost,
    read and read good books, accept that we are all one, that a cosmopolitan society
    is indeed a vibrant one, open our minds to see truth from all sides, and understand
    those various aspects. Most importantly, we are products of our past. We should
    learn. Seems like our past, present and future move in circles, in a loop, cryng
    out loud, calling this whole mess a farce. What began as a tragedy ended up and
    continues to end up in a series of farce. People like Rajdeep Sardesai and Barkha
    Dutt can only shout without giving us an meaningful side of the truth. None of
    us are angry. We dance to what is fed to us by the Media, the Celebrity, and the
    Politicians. The three 'holy trinity' if I can call them. On one end of the spectrum,
    here is a Thackeray who is a 'great' personality and on the other end, a 'mass-murdering'
    opportunist. You cannot ignore the 'other'. That only adds to myopia and a lop-sided
    information of facts. Again, this World is too big to play the 'blame-game'. Let
    me sum up by saying this we are all one. And those who think otherwise, may look
    up at History books and sharpen their analyzing skills.

    appreciate, to recognise, to respect a person for good things he has done. When
    he was alive he did tremendous social work for people of Maharashtra (including
    Muslims) and therefore entire Maharashtra, including people of different religion,
    stood by him when he was taking his last breath. \r\n\r\nFrom reading the article
    and few comments its clear that there are a few people who do not recognise this,
    but the fact remains fact."

  content: "1. A man does not suddenly become blame free just because he died. If
    the evil that he sowed prevails after he's dead, his criticism must also continue
    much after he's cremated.\r\n2. Hate politics has many violent fans and ardent
    supporters, it is natural to be able to galvanize a mob on the pretext of hate.
    Thackeray did just that. The only real challenge he must have had to face would
    have been fighting his own conscience while killing thousands of innocent people
    and directing hate towards his own countrymen (not just muslims but the south
    Indians in the 70s and the people from UP/Bihar more recently).\r\n3. State honors
    being conferred on a man who threatened the integrity of the nation and made a
    mockery out of the very principles by which we stand is indeed a shame.\r\n4.
    Killing people in the streets of Mumbai for gain of power while thousands of poor
    farmers died each day in not so far away places of the Vidharba region is in no
    way something the dead man should be proud of. He and his supporters are, sadly.\r\n5.
    Switching his loyalty/support between BJP and Congress shows how much of a believer
    he was in his own principles and how much was he willing to bend to please his
    benefactors."

    due to his nonsense and mahaartis it commenced in january!! He killed many many

    do? Why did he feel the need to send his people and burn a random muslim home?
    It was him who made it worse for the city! He so so din't stand up rather worsened
    the situation! But still people SHOW this respect out of shit FEAR! People are
    being forced to keep their shops closed. WHY?? Why force? If he was so good people
    would have done it themselves! Mumbaikars were informed to be home and avoid going
    outside! WHY? FEAR OF BEING STABBED BY THEM ! the people in cars were showered
    with stones by the shiv sainiks for travelling without knowing why that's FAIR
    and RIGHT? That's what their party aims for! Vandlism in every sense! A girl commented
    against them so they go the hospital owned by her relative and destroy it!  \r\nRemoving
    immigrants is fine cause it was getting too crowded but for that you beat them
    up or even kill them. You take extortion. You don't bother any big personalities
    who are non maharashtrians is clearly a signal that he so so din't do it for good
    but only to make it ugly and fill his pockets!\r\nOther riots have also taken

    a state honour! And its all been given in mere FEAR cause if denied they would
    surely break your leg! Utter nonsense! \r\nBefore you follow, know who you're
    following! Those claiming to follow him and continue his so called 'legacy' i
    just hope you'll make a better image of shiv sainiks and don't harass innocent

    But if that is true why is this city still the way it is? Why is the entire city
    still complaining about the same old basic issues of the 60s? Where is this progress
    we all keep talking about? Is the adoption of internet a sign of progress? Or
    fancier cars and more bridges to drive them on? Or mobile phones and hospitals
    and international quality hospitals? More parks maybe? And what role exactly did
    the orange army play in any of it? \r\n\r\nAll of this just goes to that the biggest
    bomb of them all is propaganda. If you have enough hate, you can force just about
    anybody to go to war with you. You can tell them you'll fight for them and get
    them a nice flat instead of a shanty in the slum. You can tell them they'll be
    well fed and guaranteed a job somewhere. Whoever said anything about living up
    to those promises?\r\n\r\nMy dear Shiv Sena fans, if his propaganda over the years
    meant much and actually had enough will to change things for you alone, most of
    you (hate to say it) wouldn't be lost in a dirty shanty. Like plastic bags in
    this city's drains. \r\n\r\nCalling a spade a spade is just all right. Maybe he
    should've tried to do a bit of shoveling too?"

    Thackeray's legacy; she's not in India at the moment. I remember several of her
    shows drawing attention to the divisive politics of the Thackerays, from this
    one, asking whether Bal Thackeray's comments on Tendulkar were an attack on the
    idea of India, to one on "Marathi pride or Goonda raj" some years ago. Much as
    I agree with and admire the rest of your article, I don't think she belongs in
    this list, and it's inaccurate to give the impression that she was part of the
    disgracefully sycophantic reaction from TV's high priests.

    then have people who don't accept what someone has done for them. Just by being
    born doesn't make you a human. At the end of the day, its how you live your life
    is what separates us from the others. Bala Saheb lived in a way that would lead
    as an example for generations on how to live your life. He stood by and worked
    till his final breath for his people. I know that I will try my best to emulate
    him and if while doing that I meet my end then I will know I am going trying to
    serve and protect my people. \r\n\r\nZilika, you say he didn't save our lives
    during riots. Then who did ? Was it the congress govt or was it some other god
    ? You are right riots weren't as bad in mumbai but that again is only due to the
    Tiger and his sena. You say his maha aartis were nonsense. Then what do you call
    the loud blaring from the various mosques spread through out mumbai. And that
    continues till date even though the maha aartis have stopped. Then you say he
    killed many poor muslims. What about the hundreds of Hindus killed by the muslims.
    What was he supposed to do ? Sit back and watch his people getting slaughtered
    ! Just so you know, today the bandh wasn't called by shiv sena. It was the regular
    people who stood up and declared that they will shut their businesses. If that
    is not RESPECT then what is it. Certainly not fear in my books. And please give
    me one instance of stone pelting today. And if anyone deserved to be draped in
    the Tri-Colour in his final journey it was him. He lived for Maharashtra and Hindustan.
    \ \r\n\r\nSonia, please enlighten me on how exactly did Bala Saheb create a sectarian
    rift or communal discord. Maybe you have forgotten the role of muslim mobs when
    an entire mob killed helpless women and children. The violence post the demolition
    wasn't started by him or any other Hindu for that matter. What Bala Saheb and
    his sena did was a reaction to the violence started by those fanatics. I agree
    that communal harmony needs to be maintained but certainly not at the cost of
    Hindu lives or their feelings. And no, people like Bala Saheb Thackerey are not
    in every country. They are not in even born regularly. They come once in a while
    and that's why we are blessed and privileged that we live in an era in which God
    himself walked the earth."

    get good education so that they may also become scientist, doctor, lawyer, ias,
    ips, pcs and serve the nation like other north indian, up-bihari instead of  hateing.  He

    a policy of divide and rule, to be very frank if u turned back the pages just
    any one of his admirer or fan can tell me one notable piece of work he did for
    marathi people leave alone the country, u find none, all he did was that he played
    a role of that lethal catalyst and trigger violence  with his hate speeches and
    muscle power, he was no different from any other corrupt politician of this country
    belonging to any state, like all corrupt he used his influence and power to regulate
    and control innocent people initiate riots and be a beneficiary to those who licked
    his power sole for there own benefit, i have just one thing to say and if this
    is implemented in our country we no longer need debates like this - politician
    and people like bal thackrey are like diapers, they need to be changed and removed
    regularly and for the very same reason, i hope all of u got my point.

    That too without any law and proper reasoning?! If someone would just demolish
    your temple and dance on its dome wouldn't you be hurt? Even they were. Even you
    would be deeply hurt and abuse and do what they did. So stop getting regional!
    I'm not a muslim but i'm a human atleast! They retaliated cause they had a point
    ! A darn big point ! They din't start it right ! They so din't wanna fight or
    kill !\r\nAnd about the riots he surely was the one who didn't save it! Go get
    your facts right and ask the common people and the people who went through not
    his followers who blindly follow him! he was the one to send shiv sainiks on the
    road. He sent them to a muslim houses and burnt them! The muslims had a reason
    to do it cause it hurt them! What was his reason to ransomly burn people who did
    nothing and weren't a part of the mob who was attacking! And for your information
    the muslims initially did nothing to the people they only damaged public/government
    vehicles without killing anyone literally to depict their sorrow and rage for
    the government! But then people gathered and it got worse. The police had handled
    it the situation was getting under control but bal thackerey sent his men and
    killed muslims. You think its right to comment that kill whichever muslim you
    see? Is it humanity in any way?  sending your men to localities and seeing who
    are muslims so that you can bur their home who have done no harm to you that's
    right? When you stop a riot you don't go again killing people. you rather try
    to make them calm cause they just din't get out of their houses for no reason.
    The police did it and time did it. Him SO SO NOT! if u do think he did give me
    one instance where he did!\r\nAnd the bandh wasn't called by the sainiks agreed
    but on saturday my brother, my friends, my friend's dad, were all out eating and
    they were told to just stop and go home! That's not forcing? They declare no bandh
    but when its open you force to shut it! Perfect politics! And his followers might
    have closed it in his respect but majority did just and just out of total fear!!
    Ask the common man and you will know it! They din't want to hit handicapped by
    sainiks so decided to stay home. The police mentined stay home and go out only
    if its urgent!-that's respect? Open your eyes!\r\nAnd please read your daily paper
    it quotes saying best buses were stone pelted cause they were working. My uncle
    was returning home. Even he was. Know before you speak. No offense to you but
    all what i know and have heard and read is really not good and doesn't impress
    me! Atleast not that he mus be honoured !"

  content: "Zilika, \r\nAccording to you if muslims damaged public/government property,
    its okay. But if Shivsena does it, its vandalism. Isn't that hypocrisy ?? And
    by the way it wasn't just vandalising of govt properties. There was killing of
    innocent hindus too. So no, the killing wasn't started by Bala Saheb and certainly
    not by hindus. And if you are interested then please read a book(will try to get
    you the name as I don't recollect it) by Sabah Mansuri (a muslim, by the way)
    for a birds eye view(for the lack of a better term). This one book has so brutally
    shed light on the events that not only it was banned but the writer was killed
    after being raped by 13 muslim men coz it gave their religion a bad name. The
    sainiks were not sent out to kill(the then police commissioner said it too) but
    what were they supposed to do when innocent hindus were being killed. The sainiks
    and Bala Saheb responded in the same way as others. How is that wrong ? And why
    should he have calmed his people when the other side was insistent on killing.
    The police then had grossly under staffed to handle the situation. Also that time
    it was the congress in power and they saw it as the perfect opportunity to undermine
    Bala Sahebs growing power and hence the situation was allowed to get out of hands.
    These are some facts that can be easily verified if you take time to read any
    credible author/journalists impartial view on the riots. It will only highlight
    that Bala Saheb reacted to the violence and not instigated it.  \r\nNow as for
    bandh of saturday, the police of mumbai did not \"ask\" people to shut their establishments.
    They \"ordered\" them shut. This is not politics. This is common sense. You realise
    that Bala Saheb was-is a god for many people. And he was no more. Anything could
    have happened. And yeah I did read that a few buses were pelted with stones but
    no where does it mention that it was the sainiks who did that. Who can surely
    say that it wasn't the congress workers pelting stones and blaming it on shivsena
    ?? Surely they aren't above such despicable acts. I for one don't believe anything
    that was written about rioting because I experienced a different thing altogether.
    I came across atleast a dozen sainiks on their way to Bala Sahebs house and all
    they did was ask me to take a different route on my way home so that I a complete
    stranger wouldn't be inconvenienced in any way due to the massive crowd gathered
    to pay their respects. A dignified send off to a dignified leader."

  content: "@Akshata, you have demonstrated exactly what I meant when I said that
    ignorance is the root of all conflict and evil. You have no personal experience
    and hence the only way for you to have an opinion is by identifying yourself as
    a Hindu. I am a Hindu too but I really don't see myself as someone who needs to
    be identified by who I whine to when I'm in trouble. But that's another discussion
    altogether. The point is, that we all need to stop saying that we only killed
    a whole bunch of innocent people because THEY killed a whole bunch of people who
    worship the same deity I do. I'm also a Tamilian. And let's face it, if I had
    to look at it the way you do I would hate all Maharashtrians for the crap that
    my community was subjected to. But I don't. My closest friends are Maharashtrians;
    my best friend is a Muslim. \r\nAll I'm trying to say is, since everyone is going
    on and on about \"calling a spade, a spade\", we need to realize that a lot of
    people are at fault including you and me for all the stuff that has happened in
    this country. But as long as we realize that IT WAS WRONG and that violence is
    not the answer in a supposedly civilized society, we can hope to see some development
    in our country.\r\nBal Thackeray may have stood up for a few because he felt their
    pain of suppression. But by saying that he was right in responding to that by
    causing more pain and suppression directed towards other communities is encouraging
    the kind of childishness that the majority of this country loves to foster and
    glorify in the name of \"respect\" or \"awe\". That's why I said we all need to
    GROW THE FUCK UP and stop saying \"They started it!\". Just be rational about
    all his wrong doings and don't go on and on about his lovely oratory skills. I
    hate to propagate this Reductio Ad Hitlerum trend, but this time it is applicable."

    shut down. Eminent journos like Vir Sanghvi (who I mistook for being an intelligent
    man) are lapping about how they knew the deceased, how they had a beer with him,
    how he was the uncrowned king, etc. I wonder how many of them would say this had
    their car or house being vandalised by the shiv sena thugs in the name of 'direct
    action' or some hokey like that. Today it is frightening how Maharashtra has developed
    a bunch of goons who literally run riot each time someone says something that
    isn't to their liking. No other state in the country is as dangerous in this regard.
    Sometimes I think even unsafe Delhi is a better option (at least i'm on my guard
    there at all times). A time has come when I carefully think of what to post online
    lest it result in a few bones of mine being cracked. This article is very well
    written and kudos to the author for calling it out like it is. Bal Thackeray fostered
    a culture of fear, violence and oppression. Those who 'admire', 'venerate' or
    'respect' him must ask themselves whether they would do that had they been at
    the receiving end of his ire.

  content: "@Akash, Yep, it's easy for me to say that this should not have happened
    because I respect humanity as a virtue and not people who hide behind a facade
    that mocks it. Once again, people really need to start paying attention to what
    I said rather than get overly sentimental. But who am I kidding? We are an emotional
    country. We think none of our actions should have any consequences as long as
    we did it out of sentiment. Akash, I am in complete agreement with you that people
    had no other go and perhaps the Sena did protect them. But the people who got
    hurt in the process were the ones without any power on both sides of this issue.
    The Sena might have risen intending to speak for the suppressed, but in turn,
    it suppressed other people who did not have the voice to fight against it. I think
    that was what was wrong. Maybe they didn't have a choice, I don't know, I wasn't
    there. But neither were you. Not in the homes of the ones the Sena tried to protect
    and not in the homes of the ones the Sena destroyed. I only say that what is required
    now is for the average educated Indian to understand that this WAS WRONG. Two
    wrongs don't make a right. Life is not all black or white, I know. But condoning
    this sort of violence for any reason whatsoever is not a trend I would ever want
    to expect out of my country. I expect my country to be outraged for every person
    in my country equally without trying to figure out if they deserved my respect
    on the basis of their caste, religion or sexual orientation. I expect this from
    my country because I expect greatness from it; a greatness I know every Indian
    is capable of if only they would take a step back and take the time to see what
    is really wrong. I respect the Sena's intentions if they were as they claimed,
    but I can never support any part of their actions, the means they used to accomplish
    them, or the leader who turned a very-not-blind-eye to all the atrocities Indians
    suffered in the process.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that you understood what I said
    here and do not retaliate with a \"it's easy for you to say this and that\". It
    SHOULD be easy for me to say it. That's the freedom struggle we fought. I dream
    of the day when keeping it remains certain."

    This includes most of the greatest dictators the world has seen. I hate having
    to bring in world politics to India because people often argue that it is a gross
    and misdirected generalization. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from it.
    I wouldn't wish another Bal Thackeray on India even if it meant he was the most
    honest damn mass murdered we have yet seen.\r\n\r\nI read somewhere that many
    industrialists and shop owners would often welcome Mr. Thackeray's involvement
    in the shop floor because it meant total silence with one phone call and that
    people celebrated him for ruling with an iron fist. But it wasn't one phone call
    that did the trick, did it? Think about it. People's lives were put at stake with
    that one phone call.\r\n\r\nThis discussion shouldn't be about Bal Thackeray.
    This discussion should be about the people who lost their lives. Maharashtrians,
    Hindus, Muslims, Tamilians, Parsis, Christians, Assamese, whoever. And about what
    we need to do as a country to never ever let that happen. Maybe glossing over
    someone's cruel and brutal deeds and appreciating his inconsequential personal
    traits is step one. But we need to come up with a hell lot of a better step 2

    \"Saheb\" had the clout to do what Mahatma Gandhi did during the Partition riots
    at Naokhali - which was a far worse situation than what Bombay's was that time
    - that of calling people to order, that an eye-for-an-eye blinds a person.\r\nBut
    no, the chap merrily ordered his goons to fan the flame - and when it got too
    late to control, he THEN stepped in and put a word. As a result, many people from
    both communities had already lost their lives.\r\n\r\nBala \"Saheb\" inspired
    the same loathing that I have for Jinnah - for creating divisions and yet hypocritically

    is only in Bombay and a few surrounding areas of Maharashtra. \r\nYou could easily
    find out how \"popular\" he was in other parts of India.\r\nBy the way, BT was
    an admirer of Hitler."

    a hardcore nationalist .if things written in article were true muslim doctor would
    not have taken care of him .. nepali would not have stayed in his home as a caretaker..
    muslim would nt have driven his rath during funeral procession ...and so on ....

  content: "Sheer brilliance. Wonderful words. Great style of writing. A world-wise
    attitude. Dude, you are the man. You certainly know how to keep the chattering
    classes use their Like and Dislike buttons with ease. Great, Fair enough. \r\n\r\nBal
    Thackeray did the same. He had the felicity of words. He had gift of the gab.
    He has the ability to speak his mind, at least be seen as one who spoke. And you
    got 144 responses (perhaps more after wards too). Thackeray got more than 20 lakhs
    likes. But the point being he spoke, and people responded. He espoused things,
    people responded. He lead, lakhs followed. So blame it on the people who followed
    him, for 40 long years mind you.\r\n\r\nThat of course you can't do. It is easier
    to use someone as the poster boy than make a collage of lakhs of faces. Or use
    Thackeray as the analogy of hate and divisive politics. \r\n\r\nYou forget a thing-
    Mumbai was dear to Thackeray. And to the lakhs who were disgusted by a lack of
    direction, drift, marginalisation happening among Mahrashtrians in Mumbai.  So
    what do you do? You (like the desire to seek a strong Lokpal or good administrator)
    seek out someone who can get people togther. Thackeray did that. And in a city
    that was getting Hindi-ised, moving towards a cosmopolitanism that did not have
    the local culture as its base. True, Maharashtrians in Mumbai are to be blamed
    for not being energetic enough to create the strong sub-cultural bases that would
    take this forward.  And so not utterly visible them, the character of Mumabi was
    changing. And unacceptable to them. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile the migrant sought to create
    a city its own image. Fine. But do it not at the cost of a city where lakhs have
    lived in a certain style and manner. Dont trample on the natives to get the sheer
    of having arrived that migrants feel safer in.\r\n\r\nSo does this mean BT was
    anti-cosmo, ani-outsiders, anti-this and anti-that. Naah. But when you have a
    city grow, and where its underclass continues to be marginalied, its a recipe
    for disaster. Marathis are not native Indians that Whites just swished away and
    set up NYC. Any community would fight back. And in Thackeray they found a man
    who could leave out th fafff and speak plainly- yes, this is our city,  and we
    have as much a rightful share of being here.\r\n\r\nWhy does North India need
    or want a city its its spitting image.  Why does the English educated class need
    a city that they think is what an urban Indian city should look like. I agree
    it was hard for the North Indians to accept and take up a culture whose members
    were dominated. Why  \r\n  \r\nMind you most of his supporters are from the Konkan
    region. For them Mumbai is an extension of their homes, their lifestyles back,
    an place to nurture a culture (not some idea of a pan national cosmopolitanism
    that is non-native Hindi in its idea and English in its origin and inspiration/mode
    of behaviour).  In that sense Thackeray was a regional cultural force. \r\n\r\nBut
    mind you, Thackeray beyond Mumbai was never a political force as he was in Mumbai.
    The issues were different. And the cultural origin of the people slightly more.\r\n\r\nDivisive
    politics>>Hmm. You have a point here. Bt Indians at heart are racist, regional,
    parochial.  Period. Thackeray just used too much plain speak. \r\n\r\nAs for Muslim
    baiting, much as it does pain me and others to see Indian society rendered asunder,
    there are N number of reasons why lakhs accepted his vitrolic hook line and sinker.
    \r\n\r\nUltimately there is so much wrong in the way India is treating its sub
    cultures, its deprived classes, its upper class attitude of designing the cultural
    mores based on imported and not properly digested Western ideas,  that a honest
    and decent underclass will revolt. And you see it in the way Thackeray grew, and
    the way SS behaves as it does.\r\n\r\nSo Sanyasi, embrace all, and then you will
    realise that the embrace and non-divisiveness that  you think is your legacy,
    are nothing but a ruse to always assume you are the Right Way.\r\n\r\nBTW Mumbai,
    or central Mumbai is no place for a middle class to raise his family in. And Dombivli
    is too far away. For those who have never seen Mumbai, please take it in for a
    fews days, and come back to Like."

  content: "Well said sunny...\r\nBut there are some people for whom only their suffering
    is important, they will never try to understand the suffering of others. Anjie
    if u ask about BT illtreating the people of other states, the very foundation
    of shiv sena was because in the very own state of maharashtrians in their city
    of Mumbai they were not given jobs inspite of proper qualification because all
    the higher posts in the city were occupied by non Maharashtrians and whenever
    there was a vacancy these non Maharashtrians would  call and give this post to
    someone from their native place.\r\nAnd what do you mean by ignoring who started
    it?\r\nAnd taking course to non violence? If BT would have not taken that step
    in riots of 1993 today Mumbai would have been ridden of all Hindus. Its very easy
    to say that when you have not seen the terror in the eyes of someone who had experienced
    the attack by the Muslims at that moment. How can you tell whether the step of
    S.S. was right or wrong, when you dint have any one running with a sword towards
    you?? S.S. was the only hope for these people!!\r\nAnd whoever has written this
    post where were your guts when BT was alive? Why do you ask questions and criticize
    the deeds of a man after he is dead?\r\nThere might be many who are against him
    but no one has the right to hurt the emotions of the people who look up to him.
    \r\nFor God's sake, He has just died and many have still not got over his death.
    You all are speaking of humanity and what kind of humanity is it to speak ill
    of a person who has died!!\r\nFor many he is their father and how do you explain
    your action of disgracing someone's father on his death??\r\nHow would anyone
    of you feel if someone comments like that on your relatives death and please dont
    tell me that you all have relatives which have never committed any sin...\r\nTo
    complain against inhuman behaviour first you should know what humanity is."

  content: "Mr. Vijayakumar Babu, I read all your comments so I will try my best to
    answer all of them. \r\nLet's start with your comment on my comment. If you take
    the time and pain to read all the above comments by various bigots(yes, I still
    they are bigots) then you will notice that none of them have condoned the violence
    or atrocities by other religions meted out on Hindus. Some have even tried to
    call that fair. So it won't surprise me if they are pained by kasabs death and
    I have said exactly that. My comment wasn't uncharitable, it was the plain truth.
    \r\nThen you called Bala Saheb an extortionist who used Hinduism, regionalism
    and violence to gain popularity. If that was the case then Bala Saheb wouldn't
    have shunned political power and asked somebody else to become the CM of the state
    or even a minister in the Central govt. He was only interested in the welfare
    of people of his state that's why he worked tirelessly to achieve that. I agree
    he used violence against north indians, tamilians, etc but was he left with any
    choice. His demand for reservation of jobs for the local public continuously fell
    on deaf ears. So what was he supposed to do. Ignore his own people ?? If you see
    worldwide there is a percentage of jobs reserved in public and private sector
    for the local public. So how was his demand unfair. Then it is alleged that he
    used violence against muslims. Again he wasn't the one who started it. He simply
    retaliated. The people of his state, his city, his country were being hacked by
    muslims. You think any self respecting Hindu leader will not respond to that ?
    So yes I agree with Cho Cho that he should be honoured with a Bharat Ratna. He
    should have gotten it long ago but its better late than never.  \r\nAnd by the
    way he never ridiculed sachin tendulkar, he only told him to not talk about politics
    which he doesn't know or is even aware of."

  content: Very well written piece. All our sundry politicians, bollywood personalities
    and other ragtag celebrities conveniently forget or ignore Thackeray's years of
    raving, ranting, threats and violence, as well as the 'turn a blind eye' attitude
    of successive Congress Chief Ministers who allowed Bal to do all this under their
    noses and did nothing to curb or stop it. In many ways we the 'mango people' are
    also responsible for allowing the Thackeray family to rule Bombay, by not protesting
    enough and being cowed down by the goons of the Sena. Even now, how many of us
    are bold enough to write our honest opinions on social media like FB or TW ? The
    more we are scared and sit quiet, the stronger the goons become. We are equally
    responsible.

    things frankly.\r\n\r\nRegarding  Sachin Tendulkar I quote his comments:\r\n\r\n\"Mumbai
    belongs to India. That is how I look at it. And I am a Maharashtrian and I am
    extremely proud of that but I am an Indian first,\" \r\n\r\nSachin, like a true
    patriot spoke from his heart. Any body will fail to understand what is the political
    element in this! \r\n\r\nWell, on a personal note I may add that for Spiritualism
    and  Bhakti tradition, Maharashtra tops and  sets an example for people of  other
    states. No where else was there a congregation of Saints like Gnandev, Namdev,
    Eknath, Tukaram, Gora, Raka, Kanhopatra ... the list is endless.Leading the Vittal
    Bhakti movement, all of them made Maharashtra spritually vibrant and prosperous
    in materialistic terms. All those Saints and the varkaris stand for peace and
    tolerance. There shouldn't be a place for violence, bloodshed or narrow minded
    politics on this sacred soil of Maharashtra. Hope, sanity will prevail and peace
    will flourish  in Mumbai."

    i request you to kindly read this http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Shiv-Sena-chief-Bal-Thackeray-blasts-Tendulkar/Article1-476966.aspx\r\nIf
    you read this then you will see that no where has Bala Saheb said anything against
    him. And it may seem that he his ridiculing him but please note that the statment
    was given in true Bala Saheb style which always has been of satire since he was
    a political cartoonist in his early years. This style of his has always been in
    attack because it seems like he his ridiculing or insulting the other person.
    But the fact is that sachin tendulkar and Bala Saheb had great fondness for each
    other which is demonstrated by the fact that sachin rushed to pay his last respects
    as soon as the first test against england got over. You can read it here: http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sachin-tendulkar-visits-matoshree-a-day-after-bal-thackerays-cremation/306385-37-64.html\r\nSecondly
    i agree that maharashtra has produced great saints who were people of god and
    peace. But when the time came maharshtra also produced fighters like Chatrapati
    Shivaji, Lokmanya Tilak, Tatya Tope, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, etc. Just the way
    you cant call these great men violent you cant call Bala Saheb violent too because
    like them he also stood up for the cause of his men."

<p><em>The Indian elite's reaction to Bal Thackeray's death raises profoundly disturbing question, argues </em><a title="Rohit Chopra" href="http://www.scu.edu/cas/comm/faculty/chopra.cfm">Rohit Chopra</a>.</p>
<p>With news breaking earlier this evening of Bal Thackeray's death, the movers and shakers of Indian society have been in overdrive as have been their lesser-known followers, minions, and acolytes on Twitter. The event is being milked for all it is worth by news organizations, corporate sponsors, assorted media personalities engaging in "me-too" memories, and political organizations trying either to generate political capital from it or, at the very least, seeking not to alienate some imagined Hindu/ Maharashtrian/ Mumbaikar voter sentiment by appearing too critical of Thackeray.</p>
<p>The world of Indian mediapersons, the political establishment, and the charmed circle of Indian celebrities have been expressing their shock and grief even as they have been marveling at Thackeray's greatness. In perfect concert with one another, these three&Acirc;&nbsp;incestuously interconnected sectors of Indian society--which feed off and sustain each other--are colluding in a massive act of amnesia. The holy trinity of Indian elites is refusing to address Bal Thackeray's culpability in the deaths of Hindus and Muslims in the 1992-1993 riots in Bombay, the lengthy record of Shiv Sena violence and threats against Tamilians, Gujaratis, and UPites, the Sena's collusion with industrialists to break the backs of mill workers and unions in Bombay in the 1970s, the degradation of the political culture of Maharashtra and Mumbai, and the general destruction of the city's cosmopolitan culture.</p>
<p>When these fundamental, defining aspects of Bal Thackeray's life and career are acknowledged by commentators, they are immediately balanced--according to some spurious notion of journalistic objectivity, I suspect--by paeans to his personal charisma, political acumen, ability to gauge the pulse of the people, and so on. Or they are subsumed within larger narratives that efface or mitigate the violence. (He was good and bad / He was an enigma / He was sweet to me / He was a bundle of contradictions or a complex figure).</p>
<p><a title="Rajdeep Sardesai Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/sardesairajdeep">Rajdeep Sardesai's tweets</a> say it all:</p>
<p><strong>Gave me an interview in 1988 as a cub reporter. Was generous with his time and thoughts. Offered me beer too! RIP #Balasahed [sic]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tiger, Godfather, Mumbai icon, hero for many, villain for others. Balasaheb Thackeray RIP.</strong></p>
<p>Most bizarrely from Sardesai, the suggestion that Mumbai might be shut today because of "respect" for Thackeray.</p>
<p><strong>When Delhi netas die, a city doesn't shut down out of either fear/respect. Mumbai does. What does that say? Gnight.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has experienced any bandh in any Indian city knows that the cause is usually not some spontaneous expression of independently-felt love for a political leader or party that expresses itself in an act of collective intelligence or emotion like a flash mob performing <a title="Gangnam Style Flash Mob" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ2hFlLMBg4">"Gangam Style."<br />

<p>The Indian media prides itself on its independence, its critical eye, its ability to speak truth to power. Indian celebrities fancy themselves socially responsible intellectuals. Indian politicians routinely remind the world of the glorious vibrancy and dynamism of the "world's largest democracy." But neither the conventions of in-house obituary boilerplate nor the pithy wisdom of the tweets emanating from the finest minds in Indian media, celebrityhood, and politics have spoken today in any honest way about Thackeray's role in one of most disgraceful episodes in the history of independent India--the pogrom against Bombay's Muslim communities in 1992 and 1993. When they have pointed to Thackeray's involvement, they have refused to ask the difficult but obvious questions that follow; questions about justice, rights, accountability, and rule of law, but also about tolerance, coexistence, and our responsibility to our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>The list of those participating in what can only be called a soft-pedaling of Bal Thackeray's legacy, through this Fox News style <a title="Fox News: Fair and Balanced" href="http://www.foxnews.com/">"Fair and Balanced"</a> approach, is a veritable who's who of contemporary Indian political, social, and cultural life. The President and Prime Minister of India; politicians across parties; Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh and other cricketers; any number of Bollywood actors, directors, and producers who queued up to meet him as he lay on his deathbed; and reputed journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai, Barkha Dutt, and Vir Sanghvi. Dutt, on leave at the time, did not cover Thackeray's funeral on television.&Acirc;&nbsp; Yet her brief comments on&Acirc;&nbsp;Twitter (<a title="Barkha Dutt tweet" href="https://twitter.com/BDUTT/status/269954869513818113">here</a> and <a title="Barkha Dutt tweet" href="https://twitter.com/BDUTT/status/269955517068218369">here</a>) in response to arguably the biggest Indian news story of the day broadly conformed to the same pattern, in my view. They did not transcend nor were critical enough of the dominant elite discourse about Thackeray, a mixture of equivocation, amnesia, and silence.</p>
<p>This is the real legacy of Bal Thackeray. To make political violence so routine that it ceases to outrage. To make the strategy of scapegoating and targeting particular ethnic, religious, or political groups part of the calculus of everyday politics. To make fear and intimidation a legitimate, accepted part of political leadership. And to constantly remind any potential critic, in media or otherwise, of the threat of violent reprisal for saying something that Thackeray and his thugs might not appreciate.</p>
<p>No less part of Thackeray's legacy is the fact that the political establishment, world of Bombay celebrities, and mediapersons who fawned over him when he was alive as much as they are doing now appear to have quiescently accepted all of this. The curious insistence on journalists addressing Bal Thackeray as 'saheb' -- imagine, for instance, an article beginning with the words, "Herr Hitler, responsible for the death of millions of German citizens"--merely reflects this legacy.</p>
<p>In recent years, observers on the political situation in Maharashtra have sometimes described the Shiv Sena as a spent force, one that was condemned to lose its long-term political battles because there was no coherent object that it was fighting for. But in all these other poisonous and alarmingly permanent ways there is no doubt that Bal Thackeray won.</p>
<p>The free pass given to Bal Thackeray today also tells us something about the pathologies of Indian life that produced and made Bal Thackeray possible: pathologies shared across those who identify as secular and those who rant against pseudo-secularists; pathologies that unite the South Bombay whisky-drinking, rugby-playing, Bombay-Gym types with Dadar Hindu colony sons-of-the-soil; pathologies that allow diasporic Hindu nationalists in Silicon Valley and Shiv Sena footsoldiers alike to believe that they are the victims of a secret cabal of Muslims, Marxists, and Macaulayites. Thackeray did not, then, come out of nowhere. He was not the creation simply of disaffected subaltern Maharashtrian communities or of middle-class Maharashtrian communities who felt outsiders had snatched what was their due. He represented something central in Indian political society--not an essentialist, ahistorical tendency but a historically produced capacity for using violence as a form of political reason, the absence of a coherent vision of solidarity that could respect similarity and difference, and the many deep failures of the postcolonial Indian state that our exceptionalist pieties about Indian tolerance, coexistence, and secularism often obscure.</p>
<p>And no, we do not need to be silent on any of this just because Bal Thackeray died earlier today. I doubt any Shiv Sainiks or Thackeray himself spent a minute thinking in silence about any Muslim killed in the 1992-1993 riots in which the Shiv Sena played a key role. As <a title="Vir Sanghvi on Thackeray" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/VirSanghvi/Astute-amp-charismatic/Article1-960794.aspx">Vir Sanghvi's article on Thackeray,</a> posthumously anointing him the "uncrowned king of Mumbai" reminds us, Thackeray's chief objection to Mani Ratnam's <em></em>representation of him in the film<em> Bombay</em> was that his cinematic alter-ego expressed regret at the riots.</p>
<p>It is a disgrace that Bombay is shut today. It is a disgrace that Thackeray is being wrapped in the national tricolor. It is a disgrace that he is being given state honors in his death. And it is a disgrace that none of our political leaders, celebrities, or media personalities seem to think any of this is a disgrace. And that if they do they are terrified of saying so.</p>
