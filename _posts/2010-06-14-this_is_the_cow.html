    metaphor for India:\r\n\r\n\"The bear flaunts its claws;\r\nRiding the back of
    the cow.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Garver found a Maoist exposition of the poem which said:
    \"[India] is no better than a cow... it is only food or for people to ride and
    for pulling carts; it has no particular talents.  The cow would starve to death
    if its master did not give it enough to eat.... Even though this cow may have
    great ambitions, they are futile.\""

  content: "A. This has been making the rounds of the interwebs via unwanted email
    forwards for a good six or seven years now.\r\nB. Amazed that Manan would put
    up the work of such an obviously Orientalist author, even in jest. I am not really
    being a*@| here, but I feel that this \"satisfying exposition\" (for Manan) is
    just a blatant display of ignorance. How does he know the author was Hindu, and
    that Bowles did not invent it? Further, how is it a precise representation of
    \"the average Hindu's feeling about this exalted beast?\" \r\n\r\nWhat
    this blog lacks in rigor, it makes up in shameless partisanship."

    Janes Bowles partisan.

<p>From Paul Bowles, <em>Their Heads are Green and their Hands are Blue</em> (New York: Random House, 1963): 57-8</p>
<blockquote><p>The most satisfying exposition I have seen of the average Hindu's feeling about this exalted beast is a little essay composed by a candidate for a post in one of the public services, entitled simply "The Cow." The fact that it was submitted in order to show the aspirants mastery of the English language, while touching, is of secondary importance. </p>
<blockquote><p>
The Cow</p>
<p>The cow is one wonderful animal, also he is quadruped and because he is female he gives milk - but will do so only when he has got child. He is same like God, sacred to Hindu and useful to man. But has got four legs together. Two are foreward and two are afterwards.</p>
<p>His whole body can be utilized for use. More so the milk. What it cannot do? Various ghee, butter, cream, curds, whey, kova and the condensed milk and so forth. Also, he is useful to cobbler, watermans and mankind generally.</p>
<p>His motion is slow only. That is because he is of amplitudinous species, and also his other motion is much useful to trees, plants as well as making fires. This is done by making flat cakes in hand and drying in the sun.</p>
<p>He is the only animal that extricates his feedings after eating. Then afterwards he eats by his teeth which are situated in the inside of his mouth. He is incessantly grazing in the meadows.</p>
<p>His only attacking and defending weapons are his horns, especially when he has got child. This is done by bowing his head whereby he causes the weapons to be parallel to ground of earth and instantly proceeds with great velocity forwards.</p>
<p>He has got tail also, but not like other similar animals. It has hairs on the end of the other side. This is done to frighten away the flies which alight on his whole body and chastise him unceasingly, whereupon he gives hit with it.</p>
<p>The palms of his feet are so soft unto the touch so that the grasses he eats would not get crushed. At night he reposes by going down on the ground and then he shuts his eyes like his relative the horse which does not do so. This is the cow.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
