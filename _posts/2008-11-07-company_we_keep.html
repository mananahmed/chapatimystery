  content: "Thanks for this post.  I was thinking about writing something about the
    way the administration looks to be shaping up, specifically around US imperial
    interests, but this does a nice short, blunt job of it.  Then there's <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/prashad11072008.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Vijay Prashad's</a> longer piece over at Counterpunch.  It's
    worth noting that you can drop the transition team a note at: http://change.gov/page/s/ofthepeople  It'll
    probably be as effective as my vote for McKinney-Clemente, but, as with that vote,
    you might as well try, right?"

<p>Rahm Emanuel: "In an interview with Ma'ariv, Emanuel's father, Dr. Benjamin Emanuel, said he was convinced that his son's appointment would be good for Israel. "Obviously he will influence the president to be pro-Israel," he was quoted as saying. "Why wouldn't he be? What is he, an Arab? He's not going to clean the floors of the White House." <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225910047157&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">Jerusalem Post</a>.</p>
