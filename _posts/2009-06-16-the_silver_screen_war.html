    almost entirely from the last few years (the superb Hey Ram (2000); Dev (2004);
    Rang De Basanti (2006); Delhi-6 (2009)), might offer a pointer toward an emerging

  content: "Sepoy: Say more because it seems counter-intuitive to that whole body-politic
    thing.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason I avoid using \"Bollywood\" and it is because
    the Hindi film industry is different from Hollywood in a lot of key ways (though
    this is changing): Regional film continues to be a player in the India market
    (though less in the diaspora) and the Bombay industry mechanics work in  a vastly
    different ways in Bombay, things like script writing, funding, stars, etc. So
    if 9/11 had happened in LA...who knows what would have happened? Maybe the films
    would be less huge disaster/ paranoid parables and more local? I do think it interesting
    that no major indie film from a New York director has worked on terror...except
    for the maudlin 11'09''01 - September 11. \r\n\r\nI don't know how Tamil films
    deal with terror, or Bengali but the point I was making about Bombay was perhaps
    a non sequitur....I wanted to ground the discussion in the particular history/
    geography of Bombay a little and gesture to the fact that this unique perspective
    impacts the narratives. It did need more explanation, thanks for pushing!"

  content: I am probably the wrong person to talk about Indian movies since I do not
    know Hindi and have seen very few Indian movies after the early 50's. But I read
    a couple of books recently which indicate that it might be an interesting area
    to study. The first is Pankaj Mishra's 'Temptations of the West' which indicates
    that the world of movie making in Mumbai is surreal. Suketu Mehta has a few pages
    in 'Maximum City'. There is a more professional book by Brian Larkin "Signal Noise'
    which studies cinema (to mt inexpert eyes) as a part of infrastructure, unintented
    consequences of development,  opening up of social spaces etc.  His work is based
    on his studies in Nigeria where Lebanese merchants introduced Bollywood cinemas
    in the 50's. Apparently the popularity and influence is quite different in the
    North from the South. I would assume that in India too, there may be differences
    from cities to towns to villages and from area to area.  I would also think that
    the popularity of the sort of films discussed in the post may not be much in coastal
    Andhra ( I come from that area). Even the popularity of the actors seem to be
    based on caste affiliations. I have met people who said that there was no meat
    in film songs and they preferred the old type dramas where the actors used to
    sing their guts out ( sometines there would be up to five Krishnas competing with
    each other in the same drama). The popularity of the dramas is on the rise, I
    am told. So, if the current Bollywood or Tollywood movies do not fill some needs,
    they may have to share their space with other forms of entertainment. In any case,
    I would be interested to know the results of the study.

    films are concerned, which -- each -- produce as many films a year as Bombay does.  In
    certain parts of the North too, the hegemony of the Hindi industry has come under
    increasing question in recent years with the rise of the Bhojpuri industry (serving

    films.  I mean completely -- this holds true for the more urbane films as well

  content: This is a very interesting project, though one would be deterred by the
    staggering scope of your inquiry. I think the most terrifying figure in the Western
    imagination is Nieztschean Superman, travelling through such incarnations as Milton's
    Satan, Kurtz, Hannibal Lecter, R'as Al Ghul and Joker from the two post 9/11 Batman
    films et. al; the ultimate challenger to our flawed system. Transmuting this figure
    to Bollywood seems impossible, and I don't know if anyone has tried. I guess one
    distinction to be made is between evil/terrorism--a boundary which is often blurred
    in Western discourse. What about Mogambo? He, too, was a terrorist, albeit with
    a very different agenda of domination. Great post!

  content: "<i>The masala-musical Hindi filmi narrative form is not designed to capture
    political complexity, or explore historical conundrums; it is designed to entertain,
    to make people lust, laugh, swoon, sing and be terrified or angry.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
    should check out Fanaa with Aamir Khan and Kajol; it is perhaps a little strange
    in having a Kashmiri terrorist as the main protagonist and love interest and doesn't
    follow the simple jingoistic stereotype although it remains firmly within the
    Indian nationalist narrative.\r\n\r\n<i>In my mind Gabar Singh from the spectacular
    1975 Sholay is a terrorist, albeit he has no interest in bringing down a State,
    or any cause beyond being evil. </i>\r\n\r\nIMO this is a totally wrong reading
    of Gabbar and the concept of a terrorist. Not everyone who uses terror is a terrorist.
    Gabbar is simply the end line of the figure of the rural bandit-villain who bases
    his rule on the coercion of the local rural populace. This has a long pedigree
    in Indian cinema going back to the 1950s, with films like Ram Ganga and Mother
    India; the only difference was that in the earlier films the bandits/villains
    were shown very much to come from rural society itself and had personal kinship
    bonds/relations with the local population which was the main source of dramtic
    tension and motor of conflict, usually translating into a conflict between brothers,
    parents and children etc. This bond meant that their use of violence was selective
    and targeted and terror was used rarely and against specific targets.  Gabbar
    is merely an extreme manifestation of this figure but has no links personal or
    otherwise with the rural society he dominates; hence any restraint on the use
    of violence is removed and the instutionalisation of terror as a generic tool
    is prevalent. I don't think this makes him a terrorist per se, just a new kind
    of villain; increasingly from this period on Bollywood villains exhibited many
    of these proclivities - you only need to think of Om Puri's numerous villain roles
    for this, though few came close to rivalling Gabbar's. Gabbar's character clearly
    echoes the lawless and sadistic villains that were predominant from the late 60s
    onwards in the Spaghetti Westerns - I think some scenes such as the famous fly
    scene are almost identical.\r\n\r\n<i>More traditional terror genealogies (like
    those found here and here) would probably start with the 1986 Karma by Subhash
    Ghai, a crude amalgam of Sholay and 70s Hindi cops &acirc;&euro;&tilde;n&acirc;&euro;&trade;
    robbers films. Karma features a terrorist turned mercenary played by Naseeruddin
    Shah&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an actor to remember as I run through the terror films
    today. However Karma, is about vigilante justice and personal vengeance, the State
    only begins to get involved in the nineties with films like Mehul Kumar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    Tirangaa (1992) or Droh Kaal (1994) made by Govind Nihilani, starring Om Puri
    and our man Naseeruddin Shah</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to say, I disagree again here.
    Karma is an interesting film, I remember watching it several times as child since
    it was a relatively big hit when it came out; yet the figure of the State looms
    ominously throughout the film if rarely made explicit. It is also a film at least
    partially about personal redemption, since in the style of the Dirty Dozen, the
    group of heroes welded together to destroy the bad guys are former criminals,
    murderers or otherwise good-for-nothing types with one exception. And who whips
    them into shape? Dilip Kumar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ex-police/jailor; who disgusted
    with the inability of the State to track down and destroy the villains, decides
    to raise, train and fund his own private mini-commando group to do so recruiting
    Shah and others on the way. The whole film is shot through with nationalist iconography
    that relies on Gandhian and Nehruvian concepts of culture and patriotism from
    the fantasy of the early scenes where prisoners are shown to be rehabilitating
    themselves through productive manual labour and singing uplifting patriotic songs
    and collective excercises in a typical Gandhian ideal of social harmony to the
    more explicit end scenes where Dilip Kumar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s character corners
    Dr. Dang and manages to machinegun an outline of India around his figure then
    extolling the tiranga. This scene was quite famous at the time, I enclose a cheesy
    link to it below!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li1d_zy77jQ&amp;feature=related\r\n\r\n
    The ideological message and symbolism is pretty clear; from the exchange of taunts
    that occur in the film; whether it is DK&acirc;&euro;&trade;s police officer replying
    to Dang&acirc;&euro;&trade;s taunt that in Hindustan everything is for sale, by
    replying that him and by extension not all servants of the state are not; to the
    argument over what it means to be soldier DK has with Shah, who objects to the
    other younger recruits being separated from their love interests and embarking
    on what seems to be a suicide mission. The figure and role of the state becomes
    perhaps more explicit and differently configured but it incorrect to say it does
    not exist in these films.\r\n\r\n<i>Such a move will not occur again until Mani
    Shankar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Tango Charlie in 2005 that deals with the situation
    in the Northeast of India. However, both are art-house films with limited distribution
    and impact.</i>\r\n\r\nI wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t describe Tango Charlie as
    an art-house film; not sure why you say this. It isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t a conventional
    Bollywood film but has pretty much a mainstream cast and doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    exactly stray outside the consensus that exists on a lot of the issues covered
    and the undercurrent patriotism is fairly explicit. The only reason it gets favourable
    mentions is because it doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t tend to glorify violence or
    war but its representation of the Indian security forces and those who fight them
    is quite stereotypical for the most part. It also isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t really
    about the Northeast as such, only the first half of the film takes place there;
    the final third is located in the perennial favourite battlescape of Kashmir where
    the eponymous heroes go down fighting Pakistani soldiers and irregulars."

  content: "Conrad: you mean the late Anrish Puri, not Om Puri.  Good comment heer
    -- agree completely on Tango Charlie: it was marketed and released like a mainstream
    film (it featured Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgan, which made its flopping all but
    inevitable by 2005, but that is a different issue)...\r\n\r\nI always saw Karma
    as a more right-wing \"re-do\" of Sholay, and a more disturbing film (not in an
    interesting way), although it does have its moments.  It is also one of only two
    films that I know of (the other is Mandi) where Hyderabadi Naseeruddin Shah plays
    a Hyderabadi.  The \"state\" is very much a factor in this film, as it was in
    the  Anil Sharma films starring Dharmendra from this period (Tehelka, Farishtay):
    in all these films, the villainous baddie is explicitly anti-India, is allied
    to foreigners, and has control of territory on or just outside India's frontiers.
    \ By contrast, Gabbar's mythic force in Sholay arises in part from the fact that
    he is no cartoon of the poisonous foreigner threatening \"us\", but that he is
    very firmly rooted in the \"domestic\" ethos -- he isn't \"of\" the village of
    Ramgarh, but he is part of the landscape, and no outsider.  [I might add that
    in Sholay's original ending Ramesh Sippy had Sanjeev Kumar kill Gabbar at the
    end, but the sequence had to be re-shot as the Indira Gandhi government didn't
    like the idea of people taking the law into their own hands at a time when memories
    of Jayaprakash Narayan's movement were fresh, and in the year the Emergency was
    declared. A decade later, Karma \"redeemed\" this aspect of Sholay; by then, greater
    vigilantism and \"corrective\" violence had become more common in Hindi films
    (not to mention that such violence had become more and more legitimate even in
    mainstream politics), so much so that Amitabh Bachchan gunned down an entire state
    cabinet in Inquilab (1984; the year Amitabh was elected to the Lok Sabha)."

  content: "There is no back story as such, but stray dialogues in the film (as well
    as the fact that his speech/lingo is clearly supposed to \"represent\" some kind
    of rural dialect) do \"situate\" him (MacMohan tells Gabbar towards the end, after
    the dacoits have captured Hema Malini, that they had seen her dancing at a wedding
    a year ago; the staging of the legendary Helen \"Mehbooba\" song suggests usage,
    and indeed, it is Gabbar's habit of going to check out dances etc., like a sort
    of perverted twin of the aristocrat, that enables Jai and Veeru to try and get
    him there).\r\n\r\nAside: I remember reading somewhere, but now cannot remember
    the book's title, that in a handful of places audiences cheered Gabbar cutting
    off the hands of Thakur (while the film certainly ends by re-inscribing Thakur
    as the head of a virtuous economy, by 1975 it is too late for Hindi cinema's thakurs:
    he has symbolically been rendered impotent by the loss of his hands, and must
    rely on two thieves (both far more outsiders to the milieu than Gabbar, two \"unmarked\"
    urbane guys) to get Gabbar (of course, the old colonial trope of the \"metropolitan\"
    having to save the rural from itself -- this trope has continued unchecked over
    the years, most openly and noxiously in recent years in the well-meaning Swades,
    specifically SRK's speech on caste etc.)  But post-Sholay, most thakurs in Hindi
    cinema (when they still had thakurs, back when a film might actually be set in
    rural India, or even India) were villains, and typically ones who would incarnate
    the corruption of the status quo: cops would be in their pay, they would rape
    poor village girls, etc. (Amjad Khan himself played just such a thakur in Ganga
    ki Saugandh: in the film, the Brahmin Amitabh ultimately leads a coalition against
    him, one including Dalits (headed by Pran, the father of Bachchan's love interest)
    and Muslims)."

  content: 'Purdah: I think you ignore the genre of Bollywood films where "the Muslim"
    is a terrorist, but a sympathetic character who has been led "astray", or who
    responds to violence and injustice by becoming a terrorist.  Thus we have Fiza
    (Hrithik becomes a terrorist after the Bombay communal violence of 1993); Mission
    Kashmir (Hrithik becomes a terrorist when he finds out his parents were accidentally
    killed by the Indian military); Dhoka (the lead female protagonist becomes a terrorist
    after she is raped by Indian policemen); you mentioned Dil Se already (although
    Manisha''s communal identity is ambiguous).  These films of course feed into an
    older masala trope, where a virtuous man becomes a gangster/criminal in response
    to injustice -- typically these films are about the "contest" between this criminal
    (who exposes the system''s own criminality in a sense) and a younger hero/oppositional
    figure who upholds the status quo and represents its goodness: Mother India is
    perhaps -- perhaps -- part of this trend, but we certainly see it in full flower
    by the mid-1970s: Adalat (both the innocent-bumpkin-turned-gangster and his son
    are played by Amitabh Bachchan); a decade later, Mashaal (Dilip Kumar reforms
    thug Anil Kapoor, then himself becomes a gangster while Kapoor has become a crusading
    journalist.  For Rati Agnhotri, I''d be anything), and many more.  Kaalia is a
    variant of this, where Bachchan is transformed from Myshkin Idiot to cool gangster,
    but there''s no real virtuous opposition figure (perhaps testimony to the fact
    that by the early 1980s, Amitabh had become, as Truffaut called him, the "one-man
    industry", and others were often dispensed with).'

    should have included this in the above comment: the above the are the lines I
    was responding to.\r\n\r\nI would also disagree that Naxalites and Tamil Tigers
    and NE insurgents were ever habitually represented on the Hindi film screen --
    in fact the only films that I can think of featuring Tamil Tigers and NE insurgents
    were directed by Mani Rathnam, a Tamil film director (the former was a tamil film;
    the latter, Dil Se) -- Tango Charlie is an exception, but this film is a disneyland
    of Indian insurgencies, with the film lurching from one to the other.  Sarfarosh
    did feature both Pakistani-backed terrorists (although Naseer's character, offensively
    a ghazal-singer in the pay of the ISI, is animated not by religion but by a sense
    of historical injustice, as he lost everything during Partition) as well as Naxalites
    (who purchased arms from the Pakistan-backed terrorists as well as the money-minded
    Marwari seth).  There has not been a trend IMO to replace a broader category of
    terrorists with Muslim ones; instead, it has been to replace the cartoonish, unmarked
    anti-nationals seen in Karma etc. in the 1980s, with the Muslim jihadi fanatics
    of the 1990s, and (perhaps more recently) also the upstanding Muslim youths led
    astray due to injustice perpetrated on them.  Indeed, since the start of the Indo-Pak
    peace process 5-6 years ago, jihadi fanatics have mostly vanished relative to
    their heyday in the late 1990s."

    A. Dialog.  Seetis &amp; Taalis.  [Throws coins at monitor.]\r\n\r\nI would exclude
    the likes of Bhagat Singh from the \"terrorist\" movies, because there is never
    any sense in the movies that he is anything other than entirely virtuous; if he
    is a terrorist, then Attenborough's Gandhi is part of the tradition of Hollywood
    representations of convicts.  [Aside: the best Bhagat Singh movie from Bollywood
    is Raj Kumar Santoshi's The Legend of Bhagat Singh, written by Anjum Rajabali;
    it's the one that is the most honest about the fact that he was a communist, and
    is otherwise relatively solid historically]...\r\n\r\nAside, since Conrad brought
    up Fanaa: note that this film reflects the times &amp; the Indo-Pak peace process
    by having a RAW agent mouth that India and Pakistan were both victims of (Kashmiri)
    terrorism.  The terrorist outfit of which Aamir is a member (and in which his
    grandfather appears to be the only other member :-)) does not appear to be funded
    by anybody, have any connection to anybody, and operates from a forest (in reality,
    Poland) where there are no Kashmiris, or even animals.  Gotta love it."

<em>(sepoy sez: you can find an introduction to purdah on the about CM page)</em></p>
<p>Greetings CM readers, Sepoy has generously offered me a spot on his soapbox, a turn at the helm, a cameo in his story? Um a chance to reach out to some gentle minds&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;I would like to begin by discussing the current South Asia project I am working on, somewhat related to TALIBOTHRA, in that it is about the co-mingling of religion, politics and mass media. More precisely I am trying to follow the shifting figure of the terrorist in the Hindi language film industry and am curious about how Islam comes into the picture, and in fact about the precise definition of a terrorist, an &acirc;&euro;&oelig;aatankvaadi&acirc;&euro;[&Auml;ta&aacute;&sup1;&hellip;kav&Auml;d&Auml;&laquo;]. At the moment I am not sure what forms this sniffing around will take, perhaps a paper, perhaps a class, perhaps neither? Let me know what you think&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;<br />
<!--more--><br />
Usually I stay away from such egregiously wide canvases and I despise the simplistic, sociological, film-is-a-mirror-of-the-Indian-State-and/or-Indian-subconscious type readings of popular Hindi films. In my mind such approaches negate the agency of the filmmakers, ignore the ambivalence of cinematic narratives and engage in propagating ideology-driven, reductive readings of Hindi cinema. I could name names but that would be pedantic and beside the point. </p>
<p>So why am I now doing what I hate done by others? I suspect I was propelled down this path by articles on the failure of Iraq war movies; the Times article is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684509,00.html">online</a> but the better piece by Scott Hamrah in N+1 #7 titled "Jessica Biel's Hand: The Cinematic Quagmire," is unfortunately not. After screening nearly every film about the Iraq war released theatrically between 2002 and 2008, Hamrah draws some smart conclusions about both the political and cinematic situation in the US today that point to the impossibility of a Platoon, Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter being made today. And then I read Sepoy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s posts on the US media hysteria over Afghanistan and Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;unlike the Nazi, absolute-evil WW II villain in Hollywood movies, terrorists in contemporary US films are never directly Afghanis/ Saudis/ Iraqis or Muslims, the viewer has to do some work to get to those categories. The war on Terror is not the war in Iraq. At least not yet. But in India, the not-war on Terror is the only war we know, and is in fact the same war with Pakistan we have been not-waging since 1947. </p>
<p>Popular Hindi films made in the last ten or fifteen years have terrorists that are clearly marked as Muslim, and further have some narrative link to Pakistan. This was not always so, terrorism on the Indian screen had other names and other historical contexts (Freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Naxalites, Tamil Tigers, Northeastern insurgents). But now they are all Islamic psychopaths, trained and funded by the Pakistani government, intent on destroying India. I give you the four phases in the love affair between terrorism and the Indian film industry:</p>
<p><b>I: Just friends</b> </p>
<p><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/ck77d3joH6I&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/ck77d3joH6I&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="405"></embed></object></p>
<p>In my mind Gabar Singh from the spectacular 1975 <i>Sholay</i> is a terrorist, albeit he has no interest in bringing down a State, or any cause beyond being evil. More traditional terror genealogies (like those found <a href="http://passionforcinema.com/911-and-how-it-changed-the-hindi-film-aatankwaadi/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.glamsham.com/movies/features/08/dec/02-terrorism-redux-how-hindi-films-have-tackled-the-issue-120810.asp">here</a>) would probably start with the 1986 <i>Karma</i> by Subhash Ghai, a crude amalgam of Sholay and 70s Hindi cops &acirc;&euro;&tilde;n&acirc;&euro;&trade; robbers films. <em>Karma</em> features a terrorist turned mercenary played by Naseeruddin Shah&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an actor to remember as I run through the terror films today. However <em>Karma</em>, is about vigilante justice and personal vengeance, the State only begins to get involved in the nineties with films like Mehul Kumar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Tirangaa</em> (1992) or <em>Droh Kaal</em> (1994) made by Govind Nihilani, starring Om Puri and our man Naseeruddin Shah. However, in both these films the exact political causes remain murky and the players  are anonymous, the emphasis is more on espionage and reliable intelligence than violence and chaos.</p>
<p>An interestingly different terror film in this period is Gulzar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Maachis</em> (1996), set in Punjab in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s assassination and the Sikh killings. This film humanizes (and thus complicates) the figure of the terrorist by presenting a possible how-he-became-one story. Such forays into alternate narratives of terrors remain rare, but thankfully do exist. Of the handful of other films that explore other histories of terror <em>Maachis</em> is perhaps the most widely distributed, but it would still be considered an art-house Hindi film with limited audiences. </p>
<p><strong>II: First thrill</strong> </p>
<p><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/PswYMcW-Pfk&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/PswYMcW-Pfk&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="405"></embed></object></p>
<p>Everything changed with the Bombay blasts of 1993. Thereafter Terror in Hindi film had a target city and a cause. This is also when the talented Mani Ratnam entered the national stage with his stunning terrorism &acirc;&euro;&oelig;trilogy&acirc;&euro; <em>Roja</em>(1992)-<em>Bombay</em>(1995)-<em>Dil Se</em>(1998). These three films are among my favorite Hindi-language films because of their breathtaking cinematography and amazing music (by AR Rehman). It is <em>Roja</em> which directly features the situation in Kashmir and presents us with Indian Army (good) versus Islamic militants (bad) for the first time. In the late nineties a handful of mediocre mainstream films continued to build on this scenario and link domestic terrorism with Pakistan  - <em>Jaan</em> (1996), <em>Border</em> (1997) and <em>Sarfarosh</em> (1999) with, of course, Naseeruddin Shah. </p>
<p>The odd film in these few years was Santosh Sivan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Tamil <em>Theeviravaathi</em> featuring a female terrorist from a nameless organization determined to blow up a nameless politician (er Rajiv Gandhi anyone) in 1999. Once again we see that rare attempt to move away from a conflation of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;terrorist&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Muslim&acirc;&euro;. Such a move will not occur again until Mani Shankar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s<em> Tango Charlie</em> in 2005 that deals with the situation in the Northeast of India. However, both are art-house films with limited distribution and impact. </p>
<p><strong>III: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgoNppbAuAs">Saying it out loud</strong></a></p>
<p>The military events at Kargil in 1999 launched a slew of Indo-Pakistan war films. A few were romance films on patriotic steroids like Anil Sharma&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Gadar: Ek Prem Katha</em>, Yash Chopra&acirc;&euro;&trade;s<em> Veer-Zaara</em>, and Kunal Kohli&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bizarre<em> Fanaa</em>. The majority were action-war films on patriotic steroids like VV Chopra&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Mission Kashmir</em>, Raj Kanwar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Farz</em>, J. P. Dutta&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>LOC Kargil</em> and Farhan Akhtar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Lakshya</em>. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most bizarre of these testosterone monsters is Rohit Shetty&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Zameen</em> which starts with a historical event: the attack by Islamic militants on the Indian parliament in 2001 but then spirals into the skies and never lands on anything resembling reality. Of course this aerial nature is no coincidence for Zameen is clearly post-9/11 in its obsession with airplanes as weapons. From this point onwards, there was no turning back for the Bombay film industry: terrorists in India=Islamic militants=Pakistani minions. </p>
<p><strong>IV: After the thrill is over </strong>:</p>
<p><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/UBqgoPtlvP8&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/UBqgoPtlvP8&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="405"></embed></object></p>
<p>The final phase, as I see it, is too recent to definitively categorize as it begins with the attacks on Mumbai last Nov, or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;26/11&acirc;&euro; as many call it. There are a number of terror films already on the market: Santosh Sivan, the director of the Tamil <em>Theeviravaathi</em> is back with <em>Tahaan</em>, a film about a Kashmiri boy and his donkey caught up in the Kashmiri war, it aspires to be <em>Au hazard Balthazar</em> but cannot help being <em>Koi&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;Mil Gaye</em>; Speaking of formulaic junk there is Kunal Shivdasani&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Hijack</em> that stretches the global terror network scenario to its full, thin limit with B grade special effects and actors; I have not seen Neeraj Pandey&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>A Wednesday</em> starring the veteran terrorist-actor Naseeruddin Shah but I hear it is good, and not just from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/movies/05indi.html?ref=movies">savvy</a> <em>New York Times</em>. Another 2008 film I want to watch is Nishikant Kamat&acirc;&euro;&trade;s<em> Mumbai Meri Jaan</em>, starring the magnetic Irrfan Khan.  </p>
<p>As I end this speculative list of films I want to mention a few more art-house ones that deal with the theme of terror in vastly different ways: different from both each other and from the slew of films I discussed. I should add that both of them were directed by women&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the only female film makers thus far&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; Aparna Sen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Mr and Mrs Iyer</em> (2002) and Nandita Das&acirc;&euro;&trade; <em>Firaaq</em> (2008) starring our old friend Naseeruddin Shah. Unfortunately, I have yet to see the Das film but was very disappointed with the Sen. I found the story of <em>Mr and Mrs Iyer</em> predictable and politically facile and its cinematic structure was generic and clich&Atilde;&copy;d. <em>Firaaq</em> promises to be richer, though perhaps more harrowing as it is set in Gujarat after the 2002 communal riots, and perhaps is not even a terror film strictly speaking &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; I have a weakness for mosaic narrative structures in films, episodic vignettes that build around a central node (a period, a place or an event). As a film on violence I suspect this one will be no more illuminating than any of the rest and simply a liberal attempt to humanize the enemy and break down the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;us&acirc;&euro; versus &acirc;&euro;&oelig;them&acirc;&euro; discourse. </p>
<p>So what did I learn from this short journey, except that the mainstream Hindi film industry&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a huge, uniform juggernaut that deserves the name Bollywood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is getting less inclusive, less varied, less individual and more jingoistic? Was there even any other result possible given the nature of the modern entertainment industry and global capital? I happen to disagree with the Culture Industry as Mass Deception folks and think that there are always spaces for dissent, ways to differ. Call me a fool, go ahead. </p>
<p>The failure I have charted here has more to do with two factors: the limitations of the Hindi film form and the limitations of the discourse on terrorism. The masala-musical Hindi filmi narrative form is not designed to capture political complexity, or explore historical conundrums; it is designed to entertain, to make people lust, laugh, swoon, sing and be terrified or angry. Any admirable treatment of terrorism within the confines of this form would look a lot like Mani Ratnam&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Dil Se</em>. When I think of films that succeed in other parts of the world in representing political quagmires and cataclysmic violence the first films that come to mind are Gillo Pontecorvo&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ultra-realist, documentary-style <em>Battle of Algiers</em> or Alain Resnais&acirc;&euro;&trade; ultra lyrical, experimental <em>Hiroshima Mon Amour</em>, neither one of which is anything close to the formulaic, hyperbolic Hindi form. The most obvious way a hybrid, sensationalist form would deal with terrorism would be to spin it into an over-the-top action-filled nationalist saga, or an over-the-top Romeo and Juliet type love story&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;examples of which clutter our screen today. </p>
<p>As for the subject matter: terrorism in the beginning of the twenty-first century, particularly in South Asia&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;I know of few fictional narratives I admire that deal directly with it (Martin Campbell&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Casino Royale</em> is probably my favorite on international terrorism). The core term itself is simple, the OED defines it as: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;A policy intended to strike with terror those against whom it is adopted; the employment of methods of intimidation; the fact of terrorizing or condition of being terrorized.&acirc;&euro;</em></p>
<p>This could in fact describe the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;policy&acirc;&euro; of a number of creatures in horror films or monster films (alas, genres not largely popular in India). This definition also allows for a wider exploration of the structure of terror, the varied nature of an aggressor-victim relationship and so on. I find this interpretation or definition hugely promising. Unfortunately, it is the post Bombay attacks and post 9/11 definition that is unequivocally accepted by all the Hindi film narratives produced today and not the earlier one:  <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Terrorism is an ideology of violence intended to&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;cause terror for the purpose of exerting pressure on decision making by state bodies. The term "terror" is largely used to indicate clandestine, low-intensity violence that targets civilians and generates public fear.&acirc;&euro;</em> [Terrorism in asymmetrical conflict: ideological and structural aspects, By Ekaterina Stepanova, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, quoted in Wikipedia] </p>
<p>If this is indeed the accepted theme, there is little a cinematic narrative can do beyond what we have in cinema (from anywhere in the global) today. It is this discourse that unites the US, Israel, UK, Spain and India into an axis of victims, terrorized by international Islamic groups.</p>
<p>Finally it should be said that I am not surprised to see the Hindi film industry snap into line with the international discourse on terrorism. After all it was the city of Bombay that bore the brunt of the worst of the attacks on civilians in India in the last 50 years. Other cities see sporadic, small bomb blasts, or intermittent riots but it is Bombay who gets the maximum treatment. Even after its avowed cosmopolitan openness. Would not the film industry freak out just a little bit? </p>
