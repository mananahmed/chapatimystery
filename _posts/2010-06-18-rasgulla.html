<p>When: Thursday, June 24, 2010 at 5:00pm<br />
Where: 5 Holden St., North Adams, MA 01247-2423<br />
What: A LAPATA SHOW!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lapata/4590314420/in/set-72157624048505794/"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/06/4590314420_f212fd9dba.jpg" alt="" title="Self-radicalized Woman with Small Stuffed Bear" width="498" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-5302" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcla.edu/news/threegenerationsofrockwellcreators_276/">Three Generations of Rockwell Creators</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time ever, the artwork of three generations of Rockwells will be displayed in the Berkshires, as the work of Jarvis and Daisy Rockwell is exhibited in North Adams as part of DownStreet Art, a public art project of MCLA's Berkshire Cultural Resource Center.<br />
Their work will join the art of their father and grandfather, 20th-century American painter and Illustrator Norman Rockwell, which can be viewed at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.<br />
From June 24 to July 25, Daisy Rockwell's "Rasgulla," a display of Rasa paintings, will be in the Galerie Inqilab at 5 Holden St.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really, really, really wish I was there. Please attend in my stead and see Lapata's latest show.</p>
