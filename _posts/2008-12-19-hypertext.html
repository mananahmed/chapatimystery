<p>Bah&Auml;혖r-i D&Auml;혖nish (Garden of Wisdom) by Munshi In&Auml;혖yat Allah Kanbuh in the mid-seventeenth century. These are <i>hikay&Auml;혖t</i> (tales) of a romance between a prince Jahandar Sultan and a maiden Bahrawar Banu, translated by the narrator into Persian. Think Sheherzade, but with a Munshi. </p>
<p>I was delighted to find this on Google Books - though, it is scanned backwards, and is hard to read in the browser. The scanned edition is from the famed Naval Kishore Press, produced in 1879. Take a look at the way the text, the footnotes, and the notes intermingle on that front page. I absolutely love the upside-down notations. The day our web reaches this level of textual interminglings, is the day I will worry about print. </p>
