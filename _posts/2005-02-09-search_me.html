    On unrelated 2:
    Have you tried the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/remove.html#exclude_pages" rel="nofollow">remove individual pages</a> Google-reference? If it's WordPress set up the same as mine, then you should just need to insert:
     META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW" (inside tags)
    into wp-comments.php. Let me know if it fails!

    As for search terms, the oddest I've ever had is:
    "auschwitz gay people pdf"
    Which I really don't know WHAT to make of...

    About weird searches, I have seen better.

    On unrelated 2: Add the following in the <head> section of your comment listing, comment preview, comment error, comment pending and trackback listing templates:

    <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />

    <strong>how long is a list of strings?</strong>

    Sepoy is having fun with the search-strings madness of his stats, and I hope he won't mind if I basically rather blatantly copy him and share some of my own faves (I could probably get away with it by calling it a meme, but don't want to give the poo...

<p><img src="/img/google2.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>I was on IM with <a href="http://www.apsaras.org/">nathaniel</a> and we started trading weird searches that led people to our sites. He insisted that I share it with all of you. Immortalize them, he said. Since Early Modern Notes had some <a href="http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2005/02/spam-entertainment/">fun</a> with spam yesterday, I figured I would put some fun searches up as well. I had a nice experience with Google <a href="/archives/wizbango_tech/ah_google.html">before</a>. So below are some searches from Jan 2005 {minus the peeps looking for pr0n, of course}:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>address and contacts of chartered accountants in punjab and chandigarh</i>: dude, I have no idea.
<li><i>shalom mother fucker t shirts</i>: I believe farangi will be selling these very soon.
<li><i>love is all a matter of timing</i>: It really is, isn't it? One can fall in love at the most inopportune time. With V-Day coming, keep that in mind, lovebirds. May Cupid Be On Your Shoulders.
<li><i>wichita kansas bloggers</i>: Don't know any.
<li><i>why my dog eats its own faeces</i>: DUDE. How in heaven's name would CM help you with this? Are you messing with me Google?
<li><i>mecca to islams</i>: It is cute that you refer to Muslims as Islams.
<li><i>is beer good for your hair?</i>: I am absolutely sure that it is.
<li><i>if i had sneezed</i>: I would have said, Alhamdulillah.
<li><i>hip indian girl names for babies</i>: Hmmm, ask <a href="http://har.blogs.com/attempt/">her</a>
<li><i>mormon youth vampire</i>: Mormon Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
<li><i>field telephone for torture</i>: Whaaaa?
<li><i>do desis understand lyrics for rap?</i>: Now that is a good question. Any takers? Amardeep? Sheesh.
</ul>
<p><b>unrelated</b>: Happy New Year to the 0.3% of my readers from China, the 0.9% from Singapore and my 1.6% from Hong Kong! I am big in HK!<br />
<b>unrelated 2</b>: How do I stop Google from linking directly to my comments script?<br />
<b>related</b>: see <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/detriment/index.php?p=208">rob</a>. ["Bruno Latour looking for inspiration?" hA! and No. Not a meme].</p>
