  content: "I don't declare that Ahmedis are non-Muslims. As a Muslim, I cede the
    determination of people's faith to the Arbiter of All Things. So convincing me
    of people's faith (or Twitteristanis, or the blogosphere, or even the readership
    of The News) is largely irrelevant.   The baseline position from which this
    kind of argument works is that we all should just get along. I don't mean to caricature
    anything, but really, that's the idea. That everyone should accept everyone else.
    This is a normative position that has no counter argument, normatively. But in
    the real world?   In the real world, politics is highly influenced by people's
    perception of their value system, their moral code and what they feel it requires
    of them. The semantic debate about whether this is political or religious is really
    academic. It exists. We have to deal with it.   One way to deal with it,
    is to try to win a moral argument. But can we can  win a moral argument against
    a divinely inspired fanatic? Certainly not without an inter-generational effort.
    And in my column, I've endorsed, nay advocated for that effort:   \"A transformed
    political landscape is a long-term project. Without substantially more grounded
    and active participation of Pakistani liberals in mainstream politics, it has
    no chance of fruition.\"  In the short-term, if we want to win the Ahmedis
    are Muslims arguments, we better bring at least a knife to a gunfight. Do Pakistani
    liberals have to have a social organization that can hold a candle to the entire
    Tableeghi Jamaat, the JUI (all acronyms included), the Jamaat and their appetite
    for getting young, impressionable kids killed in the line of protest fire? I am
    afraid not. And I don't see that kind of a coalition emerging from cyberdiscourse
    or English-language discourse.   The other approach is to leave this larger,
    more controversial issue aside, and to even accept the current legal and constitutional
    discrimination for what it is: existent. It is the law as we know it, just like
    for example, other laws we don't like. God knows there's no shortage of morally
    outrageous laws.   Doing so, enables us to get away from a conversation
    that we are designed to lose, and take us to a conversation that every Pakistani
    can win (and if we lead that conversation, it adds a notch to the win column for
    liberals, too).   Formulate a smart and coherent strategy that wins protections,
    not just for Ahmedis, but for all minorities, and in a larger and more powerful
    (politically) way, for all non-elite Pakistanis.   That umbrella counter-terrorism
    strategy would, for example, institute anti-terror courts, finance an uber-prosecution
    service, criminalize hate speech, and pass, through parliament, incitement laws
    that award the death penalty for wrongful blasphemy accusations.   What
    serious person will challenge that every accusation of blasphemy in Pakistan is
    a land dispute gone fundo? The overwhelming majority, nay, every one of them,
    is a wrongful claim, because, if Muslim symbols are so central to our collective
    national integrity, then who in their right mind would try to Salman Rushdie-it-up,
    especially in villages in Faisalabad, in Narowal and in Gojra? No one. And that's
    what the legal process has demonstrated over, and over, and over again.   We
    have a ready and primed argument for the taking. Even the mullahs I've argued
    with on TV accept that all minorities should be protected. I'd like to see them
    walk away from incitement legislation. They won't. They can't. They are cowards.
      The only caveat is that if you make it about Muslimizing Ahmedis, no matter
    how morally outraged this makes us, you will lose the argument, and lose the legislation.
    Sherry's brilliant parliamentary maneuver yesterday is something to learn from.
      As I said in the article itself, \"I'm not interested
    in the guilty pleasures of trying to figure out if they were Muslim or not. I'm
    interested in catching the murderous criminals that did this, and making sure
    they don't do it again.\"  I really mean it."

  content: Manan, you and Zaidi sahib are operating in different worlds. You are concerned
    with truth and justice, he is concerned with realpolitik. The two sometimes intersect,
    but only rarely. Your work will one day change the context in which realpolitik
    is being practiced, then Zaidi sahib will agree with y0u. Till then, you have
    to stick to your guns and leave him to his job.....

  content: 'Omar, that distinction is spot on.  I was completely caught off guard
    when I read MZ''s piece because I thought the statements that Manan quotes from
    it were meant ironically and maybe even sardonically.  And then it was pointed
    out that he meant them as straightforward statements of FACT.  But even within
    a framework of realpolitik, it is incredib;y disingenuous and dangerous to claim
    that the designation of Ahmedis as non-Muslims came about democratically.  As
    Manan shows, that is patently false, and for an influential journalist like MZ
    to make such a statement is unethical if he''s doing it knowingly and horrifying
    if it is a slip.  Also, even if the idea is to ''formulate a smart and coherent
    strategy that wins protections, not just for Ahmedis, but for all minorities'',
    how can you NOT engage with the toxic laws that render them second class citizens,
    and, in fact, make them the target of the kind of violence we are witnessing?  Is
    it possible that MZ doesn''t understand how citizenship is mediated through laws?  How
    the Blasphemy Law and the various laws criminalizing Ahmedis render the idea of
    ''protections'' absurd?  And actually, here is where the issue of Ahmedis deviates
    from that of non-Muslim minorities.  How do you call on the state to protect Ahmedis
    and prevent violence against them under the current legal regime?  How do you
    even bring a case against media personalities that exhort the majority community
    to violence against Ahmedis when the state itself allows this by making it a criminal
    act for them to declare themselves Muslim, or pretty much do ANYTHING that ''offends''
    the ''sentiments'' of the majority population?   It would be one thing if all
    we were facing was the toxic influence of the religious extremists on the state
    and society - then we might have been able to turn to the ''law of the land''
    to demand that the state stand up to its principles and accord all people, regardless
    of religious belief, the rights of equal citizenship.  But how can you do that
    when the state does not recognize that this category of people has equal rights
    in citizenship?  And MZ'' should realise that his job, as a journalist, is to
    CHANGE and DISRUPT the poisonous public discourse that enables these pogroms.  He''s
    not a policy-maker or politician whose job is to figure out what is ''politically
    possible''.  And one momre word on democracy:  if by that word MZ means simply
    ''the rule of the majority'' then that is a dangerous and (literally) lethal definition
    - because then what we have is the brutal rule of the majority.  And by arguing
    that we cannot pragmatically go against this majoritarian will MZ is basically
    ceding all questions of political ethics and morality to the simple will of the
    majority.  If that is the case, then we are well and truly sunk.  On what basis
    will you afford even _Muslim_ women protections, then?  Democracies are democratic
    when there are legal and constitutional curbs put on brute majoritarianism - the
    protections that he speaks of can only happen when the law and constitution guarantee
    inaienable rights of citizenship to ALL Pakistanis, regardless of class, caste,
    cred, gender, etc.  Even with those legal changes we may not win, given how toxic
    and insane the society has become, but without them it is impossible even to be
    ''pragmatic''.'

    Zaidi''s piece can be accepted as saying that a majority acquiesced  in a particular
    course of action, and/or went along with it.  But even majority-action by itself
    is not necessarily democratic (let alone majority passivity/inaction/what-have-you),
    and it''s dangerous to conflate the two (albeit rather common): a 65% vote to
    killing off the other 35% is majoritarian, not democratic.'

    of  all the Garbage amendments that various assemblies passed to score political

  content: "I think Mosharraf Zaidi's argument is that most Pakistani
    Muslims do not consider Ahmedis to be Muslims and this is reflected in the Pakistani
    law. The best approach to protect Ahmedis would be to ensure equal civil rights.
    Sepoy's argument is that Ahmedis are a Muslim sect and should
    be recognised as such in the law and that the present law does not reflect the
    majority Muslim opinion.  My view is that on a logical or a moral basis, it
    is impossible to decide who is a Muslim and who is not. Even the learned Maulanas
    could not come to a consensus on the definition of a Muslim in front of Justice
    Munir. God only can decide, if He (She/ It) is 1) there and 2) interested. There
    are as many Islams in the world as there are Muslims. The whole enterprise of
    defining a Muslim is doomed.  In a civilised state, the Government should not
    be making decisions on the authenticity or otherwise of people's
    creeds. It is should not be their business. They should be answerable for protecting
    and providing equal opportunity to all citizens, regardless of creed.  To redress
    the present situation, Mosharraf Zaidi's solution is more likely
    to succeed: Bypass the authenticity debate, build up pressure for equal civil
    rights. Agitate to strike down the abhorrent discriminatory laws. Relegate personal
    creeds to personal spheres, nothing to do with the business of the state."

  content: 'Exactly, Qalander - that was the point I was trying to make - that democracy
    cannot be equated with majoritarianism, and in fact it is dangerous to do so.  Which
    is why all social and liberal democracies have provisions against this kind of
    majoritarianism, not to mention solid protections (under the law) for minorities.  And
    Hakim Hazik Sb:  My point was that it is impossible to by-pass the authenticity
    debate and still push for equal rights for all, because unless you change (in
    fact remove) the law with regard to authenticity (this is what your point about
    the state not having the right to adjudicate on such matters), how can you - through
    legal channels - press the state for equal rights of a group that it has decided
    is non-Muslim, and whose members it actively criminalizes for even referring to
    themselves as Muslim, using the term ''mosque'' for their mosques and using the
    ''Muslim'' greeting?  Far from working within the existing framework, you need
    a framework in which all these laws with regard to authenticity (and also blasphemy)
    are not only removed, but the state criminalizes actions taken AGAINST these minority
    groups.  You cannot do all of this without demanding an end to the venal laws
    of the land that currently enable violence on the basis of ''inauthenticity''.'

  content: "@Saadia: I am arguing the same case as you. The existing framework
    is cruel, barbaric and abhorrent. We do need to change it. All the discrimantory
    laws including the 1974 and 1984 legislations should be struck down. The parliament,
    judiciary or any state institution should not conduct a debate on who is an authentic
    Muslim and who is not. It is an impossible question to answer. Legislature is
    not an apporpriate forum to determine the authenticity of creed. We need a
    democracy in which the majority can not breach the fundamental human rights of
    the minority, which includes the freedom to practice a religion, and call it whatever
    they like to call it.  Blasphemy law is an anathema and a blasphemy itself."

  content: "Within the mainstream Pakistani media, this debate is very difficult even
    at the level of Zaidi sahib's flexible liberalism (or realism, as he may prefer
    to call it). Look at liberal columnist Abbas Ather's attempt at injecting some
    sanity into this ugly business (http://express.com.pk/epaper/PoPupwindow.aspx?newsID=1100961219&amp;Issue=NP_LHE&amp;Date=20100606)
    . The column  is a good example of how a liberal has to operate in mainstream
    Pakistan today: He starts by complaining about the Ahmedia spokesman and his uppity
    complaints against \"people who are risking life and limb by even giving that
    spokesman a forum in the mass media\". His (the ahmedi spokesman's) ingratitude
    is strongly condemned. Its even hinted that the Ahmedis are partly responsible
    for their situation because they took up positions that are antithetical to Islamic
    belief and that were \"bound to cause problems\".  After taking some illiberal
    potshots at the Ahmedis, he does make the point that they are our brothers and
    sisters. Then introduces a few lines about Allama Iqbal's possible Ahmedi period.
    Paints Mirza Ghulam Ahmed in a better light than his successors. Then a few lines
    about Javed Ahmed Ghamdi's  liberal Islamic position on this issue.  This is
    not systematic argument, its psychological warfare.  Its practitioners will tell
    you they are on the frontlines, not sitting in Western Universities. They have
    to use cunning. They have to drop well disguised bombs on Allama Iqbal. They have
    to set little time bombs in people's heads that will explode one day into full
    fledged doubt about the nazria e Pakistan and other BS. Its a very dirty job,
    but somebody has to do it......I have some sympathy for Abbas Ather. At least
    he and Zaidi sahib have not taken the easy way out and decided to shift to the
    safety of debating American imperialism and Karl Marx and taking the position
    that the ideology of Pakistan and Islamism are irrelevant distractions from the
    \"real fight\" the leftists intellectuals are bravely  fighting in their drawing
    rooms."

  content: "Omar &amp; Hakim: The problem with Zaidi's \"realism\" is that it implicitly
    assumes that \"the heretic\" and \"the unbeliever\" occupy the same psychological/symbolic
    space in the \"Muslim/non-Muslim\" debate. They do not: the Ahmedi might be classed
    as a non-muslim, but this does not place him on the same plane as \"the Hindu\"
    or \"the Christian\".  Because, unlike those others, the Ahmedi CLAIMS to be a
    Muslim (criminalizing Ahmedi use of terms like \"mosque\" and \"azaan\" does not
    solve this problem, because it simply legitimizes suspicion of the Ahmedis on
    these grounds; i.e. there's no need to target Hindus in this way because no one
    calls a mandir a masjid as far as I know).  Thus, in this whole debate, the Ahmedi
    is not MERELY a non-Muslim -- he begins to function as subversive who might pass
    as a Muslim, who might surreptitiously call into question the very stability of
    the orthodox edifice.  The Ahmedi, in short, is more disturbing than the Hindu/Sikh/Christian,
    because the orthodoxy can use the (imagined) complete otherness of the latter
    to reinforce its own self-image and identity, in a way that it cannot where the
    Ahmedis are concerned.  This is not a drawing room debate among the chatterati:
    my point is that to ignore this elephant in the room, as I believe Zaidi does,
    is not very realistic at all.    [I might also add that I don't see why
    Zaidi/sepoy are being mapped onto an either/or configuration.  As I read sepoy,
    he is not advocating Ahmedis-as-Muslims in lieu of greater pressure on the civil
    rights front, he wants progress on BOTH fronts.  Unwillingness to settle for what
    Zaidi is willing to settle for is not lack of realism -- the most realistic thing
    is to realize that if even our dreams are impoverished, our realities will never
    end up rich.]"

  content: "@Qalandar Through a logically coherent, internally consistent, systematic
    argument, it is not possible to prove that Ahmedis are Muslims, any more than
    it is possible to prove that they are non Muslims, any more than it is possible
    to prove that Islam is Deen e Fitrat or that Jesus will come down to slay the
    swine and kill the Dajjal or to determine the number of angels able to dance on
    the point of a needle. This is not a rational debate. This is a theological debate
    and therefore a dead end.  God only knows the answer. It is unlikely that you
    can get God to chair the joint session of the parliament or the Federal Sharia
    court and decide the matter one way or the other.  However you can get make
    a logical argument that Ahmedis and non Ahmedis alike are humans and citizens
    and entitled to same legal rights. This is something worth having as an ideal
    and worth fighting for.  And Aamir Liaqat Hussein should be arrested."

    and argument about the citizenship and protection of Ahmadis from de jure and

    strategies they can use to change the status quo regarding minority rights and
    protections because last time I checked Pakistan is an ISLAMIC state in every
    sphere of human activity politically, culturally, socially, etc and all this talk
    about human rights, minority protections, etc is literally meaningless within
    the context and framework of Pakistani society; because notwithstanding the absolutely
    negligible and irrelevant sliver of Pakistanis who think in such terms and ideologies
    of modern human rights talk, the overwhelming majority of Pakistanis be they elites
    or low class, peasants or feudal barons, the political ideologies and structures
    are constituted by religion and the converse.  As the political historian
    Quentin Skinner put in the context of early modern English society summarized
    in an essay by Francis Robinson: \" men in pursuing their interests are limited
    by the range of concepts available to legitimize their actions, and that this
    range of concepts is in turn limited by the prevailing morality of the society\"."

    still remain effective).  I fully support Manan's efforts here. I am not thrilled

    their illiberal arguments may actually have a liberal motivation behind them (whether
    their choices are the best way forward is a different matter). They are still
    fundamentally illiberal arguments. Mahavir, Pakistan is not just an Islamic
    state. It is also a state that has to live in the real world as it exists. The
    need to pay lip service to Islam does constrain what people can say in public,
    but it is not the only determinant of what they actually do.  If you want to stick
    to your formulation who can stop you, but its not a very useful one. Take my word
    for it.  At some level, it (your formulation) is true. But only at some level.
    There are many many levels at which it is not true enough to matter.  We are
    all global citizens with multiple useless and useful identities. Even Muslims
    have multiple identities.  So do secular Indians.  Some states are more confused

  content: 'Mr. Omar, when I describe Pakistan as an Islamic state, I am just doing
    that: Description. If you are under the impression that my characterization was
    polemical, that was not my intent. It seems when Pakistanis utilize Islam, in
    your view it is only for instrumental purposes masking other goals and interests.
    Hence "pay lip service". Well color me naive but even though I am aware of the
    cynical use of Islamic symbols and religious symbols in general in many different
    societies to further narrow, self-interested ends,  the context must be constantly
    in the foreground. So for instance, in American politics there is no denying that
    when Christian symbolism is used, mostly by Republicans and conservatives, in
    most cases the motives are not genuine piety. However, Pakistan and Islamic countries
    in general are totally different animals. In other words, when Islam is used by
    the politicians in Pakistan, I dont know why I shouldn''t take it as an instance
    of genuine, substantive belief in the theology and dogma of the Islamic religion.
    The instrumental paradigm of religious belief is incredibly shallow and un-empirical.  Now
    this all initial conjecture on my part vis-a-vis Pakistan . I have never been
    to Pakistan and the only basis on which I speak is of reading books and Pakistani
    English Language media.  I would like to be corrected on my views of Pakistani
    society wherever they are wrong. (They probably are in most cases, honestly.)'

  content: "Mahavir,  Different Pakistanis will give you different answers to this
    question, but my own view is that the use of Islam is indeed highly \"instrumental\".
    This does not mean that they do not take their belief seriously.  A lot of them
    do. But you can never tell how many are faking it because everyone knows what
    the red lines are and almost no one crosses them in public. I suspect we are not
    that far apart, just that you are judging people by what they vehemently say and
    I have lived close enough to them to suspect that even the vehemence is faked
    and that in some societies (some would say all societies?) people are so practiced
    at hypocrisy, its not even conscious anymore.   I do think you are at least
    partly correct when you say Islamic societies are a different beast. The position
    of Islam in Islamic societies (in general, the ex-soviet republics may represent
    an outlier) is not comparable with the position of almost any other religion that
    I know of. The degree of public consensus on religion  in Islamic societies maybe
    almost unique. This statement is liable to be misunderstood, because obviously
    there are murderous divisions between Muslims in all muslim societies, but to
    a stunning degree, they all agree on certain public positions (Allah as creator,
    Islam as THE true religion, Mohammed as his last prophet and so on)> which is
    why even a liberal like Abbas Ather can write as if he is genuinely personally
    offended by the denial of the last prophet status by Ahmedis (whether they really
    deny it is another matter).  But in his political positions (and his personal
    life, if that is any concern of ours) his choices are frequently \"unislamic\".
    And there are entire large popular parties that reflect his position (PPP). I
    think the picture does not fit with the view that Islam somehow makes everyone
    in Pakistan commit stupidities above and beyond those that are the norm in more
    \"normal\" countries."

  content: "One of the main determinants on my view of the Islamic character of Pakistani
    society is the Pew Global Attitudes Survey done a couple of years ago. It asked
    Muslims in Europe and Islamic countries how do they self-identify, namely as Muslims
    or as members of their countries. The results:  87 percent of Pakistanis self
    identify as Muslims qua Muslims rather than as Pakistanis. Now I'm sure I dont
    need to tease out the implications of this finding but just to be explicit: the
    \ raison d'&Atilde;&ordf;tre of Pakistan is obviously Islam/Muslim homeland etc
    etc and therefore the sole constituent of Pakistani identity is Islam and being
    a Muslim. To wit:  Pakistani and Muslim are not even synonyms but literally unthinkable
    one without the other. So with Pakistani identity already being an inherently
    Islamic one, Pakistanis still feel the need to go over and beyond that and proclaim
    their Muslims first, well that's pretty off the charts.   Link to survey:

  content: "Mahavir, My point is that the \"attitudes survey\" is not a good guide
    to what choices people make in real life. What is different about Pakistan IS
    its ideology and the ideology has been hammered into people fairly widely, but
    very superficially.  But all that does to most people is that it tells them what
    to say in answer to question A or B. The same 87% vote for parties like the PPP
    (indistinguishable in its family dynastic corrupt social democratic practice from
    the Indian National Congress, but distinguishable in the fact that all its corrupt
    leaders know the correct Pakistani-Islamic answer to question A and B).  Again,
    I am not saying it makes NO difference. Obviously there would have been no Pakistan
    if there was no Islam in India (Aitzaz Ahsan's attempt at inventing Indus man
    being a good example of how desperate some liberals are to find a non-religious
    basis for the state, but also of how impossible that task is). But I am saying
    that when push comes to shove the army always picks Uncle Sam, not its taliban
    babies and the politicians act in ways indistinguishable from the less than stellar
    behavior of Indian politicians. In the long term, the ridiculous ideology causes
    a constant negative undertow, but day to day, its influence is less than you may
    think."

      Again general public did not vote for Mullah or bycot the elections.   In
    short Assembly had no mandate or  public blessings to pass the 1974 amendment
    regarding Ahmadis, people clearly new about various parties ideas about Ahmadis,
    and none party chose it to be election issue in 1970. As of \"Islamic and fundamentalist
    leanings of general public\", in every election people trounce the Mullah.  The
    real debate should be about, how to undo  a grave Injustice that was perpetuated
    in our names."

  content: "@qalandar   I have been reading more of your blog postings and in
    regards to partition you seem to hold the explanation that British were responsible
    for creating rigid and exclusive self-identities among the Muslims of India through
    the institutions of Census enumeration, the surrendering to the Muslim League's
    demand for communal based electoral elections, etc. I have to say that I am deeply
    uncomfortable with such explanations of the causal factors which practically exclude
    any agency for these conceptions from the minds of the Muslims themselves independent
    of any British colonization and authority. In other others words, many scholars
    of South Asia frankly have conceived the role of the British vis-a-vis exclusive
    and irreconcilable identity formation as if they were a bunch of magicians. That
    is undoubtedly empirically untenable and its seems present political activism
    masquerading as scholarship (post-colonialism, orientalism, etc) has become an
    obstruction to proper historical reckoning. There are two investigations and analyses
    of the creation of an exclusivist, separatist Muslim identity that I have read
    which correct this a-historical paradigm in causal explanations. One is any essay
    and a monograph by Francis Robinson highlighting the INHERENT separatist tendencies
    and ideologies among Muslims generally; wherever they are found as a minority
    with a history of existence among a non-Muslim majority, you will find Muslims
    agitating for a separate nation or such other arrangement (see Muslims in Southern
    Thailand, Moros in the Philipines, etc). The other text is a monograph published
    about a year ago which documents Islamic revivalism and reformation in PRE-COLONIAL
    India with such figures as Sirhindi, Shah Wali Allah who at the, mind you, height,
    the zenith of Islamic domination of India were arguing the Muslims have strayed
    too far in their assimilation to the overwhelmingly shirk environment of Hindu
    India and a cleansing and purifying process was adamantly required and that process
    could only be achieved by going back to first principles, namely the Koran and
    the Hadith. Of course what was unorthodox and novel about this philosophy was
    the complete jettisoning of the jurisprudential schools and interpretations  which
    had arisen obviously subsequent to their composition, and therefore a textual
    literalism without the intermediation of such accretions was the only proper path;
    literally therefore an Islamic Fundamentalism. And of course the North Indian
    Muslim elite was quite receptive to these new movements and ideological constructions
    independent once again of the magical powers of the British colonial dispensation.
    \ This is a wholly inadequate precis for the analytical richness and paradigm
    shifting nature of the text so I will stop for now.  Francis Robinson \"Islam

<p>There is some confusion among the twitterati about the "tangent" in regards to the <a href="http://thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=242541">column</a> by Mosharraf Zaidi which anchors the second part of my post on Ahmadi legal history. </p>
<p>So allow me to be frank here. Zaidi writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most Pakistanis, however, far and widely disconnected from what has come to represent "liberal" in Pakistan, would rather stay silent. There is surely a degree of shame and guilt for living in a country that has, even if it is by some degrees of separation, essentially participated in ghettoising an entire community. For most Pakistanis, however, there's something more important than this shame. There is a fierce commitment to Islam. </p>
<p>This narrative of overarching religious devotion needs to be understood for what it is. Most Pakistanis are not particularly religious, but are very, very particularly devoted to the symbols of their religion. There is scarcely a symbol more central to Pakistani Muslims than the life, times and person of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him. The flat and comprehensive finality of the Holy Prophet is non-negotiable.</p></blockquote>
<p>To reconstruct: the majority of Pakistanis are fiercely committed to Islam; their fierceness coalesces around the finality of the Prophet and this fact is "non-negotiable". Over the history of Pakistan, there has emerged a "democratic discourse" which has concluded that Ahmadis are not Muslim; which is reflected in the Constitution. </p>
<p>This is an illiberal statement, and I called it "absurd" on historical grounds. I cited 80 years of case work (with the final determination as late as 1969) which concludes on evidences both internal and external to the religious debates that Ahmadis are Muslim and they do believe in the finality of the Prophet. In the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/we_are_all_ahmadis_iv_a_history.html">earlier post</a>, I attempted to show that the anti-Ahmadi movement, since the 1880s, was patently political and manufactured by religious elites. That does not scream "democratic discourse" to me. Lastly, that the very labeling of Ahmadis as non-Muslim was a political (and later, judicial) coup which went against both communal practices and legal precedence.</p>
<p>To casually assert, in a column ostensibly against Ahmadi exceptionalism, that these are "uncomfortable religious conversations" is to cede both the moral and the legal ground to those who terrorize and de-humanize citizens of Pakistan. </p>
<p>I happen to like Zaidi's work. This post was in the works before I read his column but it crystallized for me the need to engage directly in this narrative because I would rather convince him: Ahmadis are Muslim; they are citizens; the processes through which they were declared non-Muslim, non-citizen were un-democratic, tyrannical processes; we either stand with them against the terrorists or we all suffer their fate. </p>
