<p>From the inbox, a great event in NYC, hosted by <a href="http://brownstarrevolution.com/home.html">Brownstar Revolution</a>:</p>

With performances by DJ Rekha, The Kominas, Hari Kondabolu, Fair and Kind, and others, UNIFICATION 2010 will explore the politics of our motherlands, reveal the experiences of being brown outside of it, and question the tensions between us, while fostering a movement towards a more peaceful, unified South Asia.

<p>If you are in NYC, you should go - say hi to the Kominas or, more appropriately, yell something obscene at them. </p>
