  content: '"Is punishment part of education?" So it''s Adler''s fault that Chicago
    is "Where Fun Comes to Die"? I almost sent this to my students, but thought they
    might read it the wrong way since I am in the process of grading.'

  content: Did you tweak the captions? I am at the end of the longest term ever, sat
    opposite John Redwood at dinner on Friday, and can't stop myself from learning
    all that PM on the BBC's Radio 4 has to tell me regarding 'All I need to know
    about water cannons.' So I am a little addled. I love that Life Magazine knew
    all along that women knit in order to keep weapons at the ready.
