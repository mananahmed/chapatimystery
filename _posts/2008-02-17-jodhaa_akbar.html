  content: Yeah, the movie was not particularly good. All of the valiant characters
    were Brahmans, with the exception of Akbar. And Akbar's relationship with Islam
    is a bit ridiculous in the movie. Apparently, he's above the influence of his
    clerics, but totally in touch with the ascetics in the neighborhood. He visits
    the Chisti shrine before deciding to marry Jodha, he dances with some qawwali
    dervishes (in a very lackluster sequence), but doesn't listen to the imams he
    keeps at court. All Akbar does is fight, promote Hinduism, and thwart the evil
    plans of Muslims. Evil bad terrible Muslims. Ridiculous.

    he keeps at court.  Akbar's tensions with Islamic clerics and his affinity
    for Sufi mystics are well known. He carried out various \"pro-Hindu\" measures
    that were unpopular with the Islamic clerics such as -Abolition of jizya tax
    on non-Muslims -Abolition of pilgrimage tax on non-Muslims -Non-discrimination
    against Hindus in the Mughal court  Another sore point with Islamic clerics
    was Akbar's view that there is truth in all religions, which resulted in his attempt
    to create a new religion Din-e-ilahi.  His affinity with the Sufis, particularly
    of the Chishti order, is also well known.  I don't think that the movie
    shows Akbar promoting Hinduism. In the time of the Mughals, Hindus were treated
    with contempt and discriminated against (for example, as stated in the film, most
    of the officials at the Imperial Court were Turks, Persians or Indian Muslims).
    Akbar simply tried to restore some basic human rights to them (e.g., he issued
    a law which allowed Hindu women who had been converted to Islam and married to
    Muslims to re-convert to Hinduism - earlier, this was punishable by death)."

    movies are just basically entertainment. I dont understand why ppl have to make
    movies look so ugly. Even if someone wants to add masala to it, let him, damn
    it. its his movie, his money, his production. We are just paying a single ticket
    rate and watching it. He is who paying million to make one pure good entertainment
    to entertain "US". I watch Jodhaa Akbar. Its a lovely story base on what ever
    grounds. To me i wished there were more ppl like jodhaa Bai's and Akbar's Role,
    maybe then no one would had faced any problems btw the hindus and muslims in the
    world.Humanity is gone off this earth. Anyway, "Everything" is all man made in
    this world what is real, nothing accept birth and death. And the most silly thing
    is that ppl are just to free to critizise another. Hrithik was condemn by his
    fan. Ridiculous. All uneduacated ppl. Just like a blind leading another blind
    this is what they are doing, not thinking at all. When are such ppl around how
    will one enjoy movie with out critics. Its just too much. This time the eduacated
    one are been too much. history is boring, if someone is modifying in movies, just
    in movies, what is the problem. Dont tell me no one knows what and who the moghuls
    were???? "The"..........

  content: "Ashutosh Gowariker's doesn't have a great record with historical films
    and loves to deal with cliches, be it the white man saving brown woman from Sati
    in Mangal Mandey or the White Memsahib lusting after the rustic Indian man in
    Lagaan.  To be fair, having a Muslim character play a leading man romancing
    a Hindu woman is a major step for Bombay cinema. Indeed having a Muslim leading
    character is a nice change, because Bollywood's Khan quintet (Aamir, Shahrukh,
    Saif, Fardeen and Salman) have almost always played Hindu characters.  Hritik
    Roshan is one of the few Bollywood actors who has regularly played Muslim characters
    in his films, of course, they were all terrorists (so maybe that weakens my point
    :-)), but they were all poor misunderstood boys who were raging against the system
    as well (which strengthens it) but they were redeemed by the good Muslim woman
    (his sister, his wife) who usually shot him. Bollywood is surprisingly hard to
    read.  There are a couple of interesting scholarly articles focussing on
    Muslim women in Bombay cinems by Mukul Kesavan and Fareed Kazmi in Forging Identities:
    Gender, Communities and the State (Zoya Hassan ed.1994)  \" Muslim Socials
    and the Female Protagonist: Seeing a Dominant Discourse at Work Fareed Kazmi 226\" 
    \ \t \"Urdu, Awadh and the Tawaif, the Islamicate Roots of Hindi Cinema Mukul
    Kesavan 244   Lawrence Liang has written something on the changing personality
    of the Bollywood villain which discusses the Good Muslim- Bad Muslim phenomenon."

    movies seriously. Most of these Bollywood movies are so ridiculous. I don't know
    how anyone can watch them and not be embarrassed. There are some interesting and
    admirable movies made by independent minded people like Rajat Kapoor. But Jodhaa
    Akbar is not one of them. Instead I would recommend you to watch Rajat Kapoor's
    new movie "Mithya". It starts as a comedy but actually a deeply sad tale. Very
    well made. But you can be certain Rajat Kapoor will never be treated like a royalty
    by Bollywood people or the suckers who watch their stupid movies. That is reserved
    for celebrity morons like Aishwarya Roy, Hrithik Roshan and a myriad others.

    the white man saving brown woman from Sati in Mangal Mandey...\"  Ashutosh
    Gowariker might or might not have a great record with historical films, but COME
    ON yaar, he had nothing to do with Mangap Pandey -- that film was directed by
    Ketan Mehta!  I have not seen the movie yet, but in general agree with spiderman's
    comment.  I mean, we only have to see the orthodox Sunni Badayuni's writings to
    see what he thought of Akbar.  Note that Gowariker also sanitizes his subject
    in various PC ways, and from what I understand has utterly downplayed the well-documented
    violence of the younger Akbar (i.e. Gowariker anachronistically apparently reads
    the \"later Akbar\" into the earlier one).  Note also that this might well be
    for an interesting reason: he might wish to avoid peddling the message that Akbar
    (read: the violent Muslim) was \"civilized\" by Jodhabai -- my understanding is
    that in the film Akbar is kinda always the way he is, and that it's not especially
    wrenching for him to accept Jodha's Krishna altar etc.  But these are just some
    provisional thoughts -- those who've seen the movie on this thread are better
    placed to say if my speculations are at all well-founded.  Re: \"most of
    the officials at the Imperial Court were Turks, Persians or Indian Muslims\"  According
    to Streusend's book \"The Formation of the Mughal Empire\" (which I highly recommend,
    although it does prove that amateurs can write as badly as professional academics),
    the % of \"Hindustani Muslim\" notables in the Mughal courts of the period, and
    even much later, was vanishingly small.  During the period depicted in Gowariker's
    movie, I imagine not very many Persians would have been represented either.  Turkic
    peoples were certainly the best represented.  Even by the end of Akbar's reign,
    I believe there were more Rajput notables than \"Hindustani Muslims\" (understood
    here as merely an ethnic/racial concept, of course) at court..."

  content: "Re: \"I'm trying to comb through my memory to remember
    any recent/contemporary films whereby the leading character is Muslim...\"  Hey
    don't forget Iqbal... the Muzammil Ibrahim film at least featured the male lead
    in ways Bollywood often does not: i.e. he is neither a terrorist nor is he the
    benevolent hyper-religious old man.  His wife is a terrorist, but remember, the
    film is all about Ibrahim's unearthing of his wife's past, including rape and
    abuse at the hands of the police.  [The relevant sequence in the film is quite
    well done, very disturbing and managing to avoid the sort of sordid titillation
    that used to be a staple of bad Hindi cinema from the 1980s.]  If we go
    a little further back, Amitabh has of course played Muslim characters: in Saudagar
    (1974?) (a pretty damn good \"off beat\" film, where Bachchan is a gurh-seller
    in rural West Bengal); Coolie (1983); and an Afghan in Khuda Gawah (1992), to
    go with his legendary turn as a Christian in Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and a man
    of some indeterminate communal identity (opinion is divided: many would classify
    this among the \"Muslim roles\") in Muqaddar ka Sikandar...  In general
    (a depressing reminder as to how sensitive \"popular culture\" is to the prevailing
    political winds), the representation of Muslims has definitely improved in Bollywood
    over the last few years: back in the 1990s all we saw were gangsters and jihadis.
    \ While major characters are few and far between, it is refreshing to see \"normal\"
    Muslim characters in various films from the last few years (Munnabhai MBBS; Armaan;
    Chalte Chalte; Khakee; to a certain extent Rang De Basanti; Aaja Nachle; Halla
    Bol).  Btw, should have mentioned this earlier: 2008's Halla Bol features
    Ajay Devgan playing a Muslim Bollywood star.  The ranks of terrorists include
    of course Aamir Khan in Fanaa.  And SRK played a Muslim in Kamal Haasan's superb,
    wonderful and disturbing \"Hey Ram\" as well, and media reports suggest that he
    will be playing one in Karan Johar's next directorial venture too.  But
    spare a thought for Dalits: I can't think of any major Dalit CHARACTERS in Hindi
    cinema barring, um, Achoot Kanya (1936), and Rekha in Ganga ki Saugandh (1978)--
    in both the Dalit is in love with a Brahmin (Sultan Ahmed's Ganga ki Saugandh
    was politically prescient though, positing a Dalit/Muslim front -- led by a Brahmin
    true, but Amitabh, about as communally transcendent a figure as has ever existed
    in post-1947 India) -- against the wicked feudals; one may read this film as predicting
    the political order in U.P. and Bihar beginning in the 1990s)..."

    on the Urdu/light skin &amp; eyes stereotype, which might well be why Hritik was
    chosen for the role of Akbar, despite contemporary descriptions of Akbar as swarthy
    and stocky and not very tall, albeit with light eyes!]"

  content: "Speaking of Hyderabadi (as well as Muslim characters), if you want to
    see really lowbrow (but damn enjoyable) comedies, check out the recent spate of
    films that have been made in Hyderabad, using (for the most part) local actors.
    \ Much of the comedy in these films stems from a rib-tickling use of the Hyderabadi
    dialect, and an affectionate representation of the Old City tapori ethos.  The
    first and most famous of these is \"The Angrez\", which combines a funny \"Old
    City\" track with an appalling NRI-scene, but my favorite is the somewhat bigger
    budget follow up \"Hyderabad Nawabs\", though there have been a few others too.
    \ This, along with the rise of Bhojpuri cinema, is to me yet another sign of the
    \"secession\" of large segments of the audience from the Bollywood paradigm, as
    the latter has shifted inexorably to a far more \"up-market\" base centered in
    major Indian metros and overseas desi audiences.  But I digress...  On this
    whole subject of inter-communal relationships, a potentially interesting topic
    is Sikh-Muslim romantic arrangements (perhaps Muslim/\"other\" more generally?
    \ in Coolie, the love interest of Iqbal (Bachchan)is Julie (Rati Agnihotri)):
    the highly problematic Gadar (2001) by Anil Sharma, essentially a re-enactment
    of the Ramayana with a Sikh Ram, a Muslim Sita, and a Pakistani Lanka/Raavan (I
    do note that in all the \"Muslim woman\" love stories, there is never any requirement
    that the woman convert or abandon \"Muslimness\", reflecting both the difference
    between a proselytizing and traditionally non-proselytizing religion, and the
    contemporary socio-political debate raging in India on conversions (real and imagined)),
    and the too-clever-for-its-own-good Jhoom Baraabar Jhoom (2007) by Shaad Ali,
    which features no less than two Sikh man-Muslim woman couples (possibly both Sikh
    man-Pakistani woman), and two sets of \"virtual\" couples too (if you think Veer
    Zaara (2005) is being mocked, you're darn right it is) -- in a context where the
    entire film is populated by \"minorities\" of one sort of another (the film flopped
    miserably, but I highly recommend it)."

    because if I recall correctly it was certainly not your typical UP urdu being
    spoken - again, it seemed to me this was a Muslim family somewhere in rural south
    India. But I can't recall specific instances of dialogue.

    of the films I've come across (and Qalander can correct me here) deal with the
    males being Sikh or Hindu and the women being Muslim. I don't think there are
    many films depicting the opposite-- Muslim males and Hindu, Sikh women, though
    this clearly happens in real life. I think this says much about how we imagine
    the role of gender and marriage within the context of religion (and I might be
    wrong, but I've always gotten the sensation that there is a patriarchal/patrilineal
    assumption at play: that whatever the husband is predominates and/or holds primacy
    over the woman's religious and socio-cultural affiliations. So the popular logic
    goes that with a Muslim husband, Islam takes lead over a Hindu and Sikh woman,
    and that imagined fear is something that strums chords in large swatches of societies.
    Except when you are a Bollywood god like Shah Rukh Khan marrying a Hindu woman;
    there, all is forgiven by movie-goers.)"

  content: "Re: \"Some folks in Andhra Pradesh speak Urdu, as do some Hyderbadis.\"  This
    one is a \"Hyderabadi\" too!!! :-) My point is merely that in North India and
    Pakistan, when people say \"south Indian\", they do NOT just mean someone who
    is geographically a southerner (e.g. Hyderabadis, or other Muslims speaking various
    dialects of Dakhani/Deccan Hindi/Urdu), but someone who is a native speaker of
    Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, or one of the other \"Southern languages\".
    \ Hyderabad is itself very well-known for its dialect etc., and an Urdu-speaking
    Hyderabadi, upon being asked by (e.g.) a Bihari where he's from, will never say
    he is \"from Andhra Pradesh\" -- if he did, the Bihari would conclude that he
    is Telugu-speaking; whereas, if he said he were \"Hyderabadi\", his Bihari interlocutor
    would immediately \"place him\" as a Hindi/Urdu speaker (it gets trickier with
    \"Deccan\" Muslims from other places, as most are not aware that there are many
    Muslims in Bangalore, Aurangabad, and parts of Andhra, and even Chennai (where
    I have tons of relatives) whose first language is one of the Deccan dialects of
    Hindi/Urdu)...  Re: \" Except when you are a Bollywood god like Shah Rukh
    Khan marrying a Hindu woman; there, all is forgiven by movie-goers\"  To
    be fair, real-life actors with Hindu women has never ever stirred any major controversy
    in India (and I continue to believe that a Muslim man/Hindu woman love story would
    not be commercially rejected for that reason; I think the prevalence of minority
    woman/majority man love stories speaks to an imbecilic reflex, not to fear of
    what the public will accept): even apart from SRK, Aaamir Khan is married to a
    Hindu, Saif Ali Khan was married to one, Salman Khan had a very public relationship
    with Aishwariya Rai, and just recently the sarod player Amjad Ali Khan's son married
    a Hindu; directors Farah Khan and Leena Yadav are both I believe married to men
    from \"the other\" religion.  That sort of inter-religious marriage is quite common
    in Bollywood circles, especially among celebs who have grown up in Bombay (SRK
    is the exception).  Even among non-celebs, one hears of inter-religious marriages
    in the Bandra or Juhu crowd quite often.  I completely agree with you that
    we need to look at this from the perspective of gender politics: specifically,
    the notion of women as \"exotic\" and \"other\" -- once we recognize this trope,
    it is not difficult to see that in inter-religious stories, the \"other\" would
    be female, and that this \"othering\" would seem only \"natural.\"  [The same
    trope often holds true in other sorts of boundary-crossing love stories: in \"Love
    Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega\", the Tamilian in the couple is female, the Hindi-speaker
    male; in Dhoom 1, Abhishek Bachchan is Hindi-speaking, and his wife is Bengali.
    \ One exception was the mega-hit \"Ek Doojay Kay Liye\" (1983?), where Kamal Haasan
    played the Tamilian man in love with a Hindi-speaking woman -- but is this really
    an exception, given that it was directed by a prominent Tamil film director?  We
    could extend it beyond religion and ethnicity: back when wealthy folks were consistently
    depicted as \"bad\" in Hindi films, recall that all the love stories were \"rich
    girl\" and \"poor boy\", and it was quite unusual to have a film be the other
    way around.  One exception to this was the 1973 mega-hit \"Bobby\", where Rishi
    Kapoor is wealthy, and Dimple Kapadia is the daughter of a fisherman -- ahh but
    wait, Rishi Kapoor is Hindu in that film, and Dimple Kapadia, Christian!  The
    same holds true for Saagar (1985), where Rishi Kapoor is wealthy and Hindu and
    Dimple Kapadia firmly middle-class and Christian.]  I should have mentioned
    this earlier: among the communally indeterminate roles are \"Refugee\" (2000),
    which features a fabulous first-half, with Abhishek Bachchan playing a mythic
    character who spends his life shuttling contraband in BETWEEN the borders of India
    and Pakistan...his name in the film is \"refugee\" (I kid you not!).  Sadly, this
    powerful first half is marred by a rotten second half that almost could belong
    to a different film, where Mr. Refugee is kinda forced to choose sides and starts
    working for the Indian state (this is quite inconsistent with the characterization
    from the first half); I note that his love interest is Pakistani, consistent with
    the ultimate identification of Mr. Refugee with the Indian state.  Another possibly
    indeterminate role is Mithun Chakraborty's in what has to be my single favorite
    mainstream masala movie from the last 25 years, Ghulami (1985).  Mithun plays
    \"Jaabar\", and his communal identity is never discussed in this film; if we read
    this as a \"Muslim name\", then this would be an example of a \"Muslim man/Hindu
    woman\" romantic angle.  Re: Phoolan Devi: as far as I know she was not
    a Dalit, although she did belong to what is legally referred to as one of the
    \"BCs\" or \"OBCs\" (\"Backward\" or \"Other Backward\" castes for purposes of
    affirmative action).  When she joined politics she joined the Samajwadi Party,
    the voter base for which is disproportionately OBC (and even within that, Yadav)
    and Muslim, which would make sense.  (Note that in the film too the dacoit band
    she joins has a prominent Muslim leader)."

    and that's my point. When it happens to celebrities, it's a different story.   However,
    the reality is that inter-religious marriages occur even in the non Juhu circles.
    And these instances bear the brunt of targeted violence, such as Gujarati Hindu/Muslim
    couples being zeroed in on during the riots and afterwards, or Hindutavadis \"rescuing\"
    women who have married outside of their \"community,\" offing Muslim men who dared
    to marry Hindu women (like in Bengal, courtesy of the West Bengal police force).  So
    for the purposes of this discussion, strictly IMO, depicting love and marriage
    between a Muslim male and non Muslim females in Bollywoood films would be controversial
    for large sectors, whereas the opposite is less likely to mess with rigid mentalities."

  content: "Re: \"When it happens to celebrities, it's a different
    story.\"  I guess I would make the point a bit more broadly: when it happens
    on the silver screen, it's a different story.  I think there's a psychological
    suspension involved that leads me to suspect that a FILM with a \"minority male\"
    and a \"majority female\" angle wouldn't be rejected by the public (none of the
    few examples mentioned above drew even the slightest protest on that ground; one
    can't say that the films were too insignificant, as \"Aaja Nachle\" for instance,
    was briefly banned in U.P. as one line in one song was deemed offensive to the
    \"mochi\" sub-caste).  Sure, a Hindu man/Muslim woman story is less likely to
    disturb folks, but I  don't think that by itself sufficiently explains the dearth
    of such films (too early to tell if that trend is changing, although most of the
    films I can think of that go \"the other way\" are from the last 2-3 years)...  Generally
    agree with your comment, though on the West Bengal story, I never got the impression
    the young man would have ended up any less dead had he been Hindu (his love story
    was truly filmi -- i.e. poor boy in love with the daughter of a rich businessman
    -- but alas the ending wasn't), and conversely, had he been as wealthy as his
    wife's family I doubt he would have been offed -- a reminder that social class
    yet remains the (obscene) faultline it is most difficult to surmount in India..."

    you are coming from, but I know that the issue of a Muslim man marrying a Hindu
    and Sikh woman is a huge deal, given the fear of supposed conversion that a woman
    would have to go through (whether this fear is founded or not; I am sure there
    are plenty of unions where neither party has had to convert) coupled with regarding
    a woman as more of a recepticle of whatever the guy is, and the paranoia surrounding
    a Muslim takeover (in case you think I am exaggerating, I am to a certain extent
    because I am thinking about the life-threatening danger that Hindu-Muslim couples
    have had to face in specific circumstances, and for them it is very real. To be
    fair, it is not indicative of the entire sub-continent, but I do think that this
    rhetoric is sufficiently fused in the minds of many people).  Bollywood
    films have always struck me as trangressing the lines, but always in a conformist
    way so that in the end, it is not transgressing the lines. There are so many films
    that do this-- stories about adultery, falling in love with someone across the
    border, inter-communal stuff, movies about hot-spots in the sub-continent such
    as Kashmir, all of which provide something critical and DO reflect certain realities,
    but only to have all of that deflated into something acceptable and comfortable.  \"though

    agree with you here as well; class was a factor too, but at this point, you and

    unless we ask the woman's Papaji himself.  Qalander, you  have an amazing

    operas as well? That stuff provides the substance for much of my fuming and railing

    the most retarded ones out there. Honestly- I can't believe the messages they
    push about women in there-- that the ideal woman selflessly sacrifices herself,
    even to the point of mentally losing it because we all know that women succumb
    to psychiatric problems because of their frailty, but overcomes it via her virtuous
    self sacrifice for the sake of the greater good and thus this is where her true
    strength lies as a human being and her role in society; they are of course religious
    and dutifully do boring ass puja everyday, and center their entire lives around
    family and children because women are not supposed to think about their own needs
    but everyone else's instead, and dress up nicely in chiffon salwar kameez so as
    to be pleasing to the eye, and are kind to their servants in their big marble
    mansions, etc. Oh, and they are always fair. Indian women who are \"dusky\" and
    \"wheat complexioned\"???? Impossible! (Though average colored Saloni in Saath
    Phere is the quintessential victim of beauty standards, which is spot on, but
    alas, her goodness, which is, you guessed it-- selfless sacrifice for the family--
    is highlighted, and thus we the viewers realize how unfair it is to judge someone
    based on the shade of their skin. Saloni may not be fair skinned, but she is the
    ideal Indian woman).  I see one more female character who is a wimpy, whimpering,
    and helpless woman prettily dressed in pink, I will pull a gun out and shoot the
    screen.   Excuse my rant, now I am really veering off course.  Back

  content: "Re: \"I am sure there are plenty of unions where neither party has had
    to convert...\"  To be fair, in my experience, conversion is more of an
    issue with Muslims or Christians than it is with Hindus. The religious Muslims
    I know would consider conversion a sine qua non of marriage (with both \"sides\"
    one would have to do the hard work of convincing families to get over the threshold
    of \"difference\", but less than conversion -- even if this is only \"formal\",
    and not understood to be genuine -- is very rarely acceptable to Muslims).  Traditionally
    one doesn't/cannot convert to Hinduism, although starting in the late 19th century,
    the Arya Samaj tried to change that.  Thus today you have a bunch of groups who
    believe in conversions to Hinduism (the Hindutvawaadis of course), but traditional
    Hindus don't believe in conversion.  This might tie in with the broader discussion
    here: given the patriarchal assumptions about women \"going over\" to their husband's
    \"side\", a Muslim man/Hindu woman love story might tap into fears about another
    one being \"lost\" to Hinduism.  [This mirrors the controversy over conversions
    in India: virtually every outfit that wants these banned or severely restricted
    is actually a Hindu, implicitly testifying to the fact that almost all conversions
    in India are from Hinduism to other religions (mostly Christianity)].    And
    this just occurred to me: in all the films I mentioned where a Hindu woman is
    romantically involved with a Muslim man, the latter seems quite a-religious and
    \"unmarked\".  Perhaps this is realistic, or perhaps this unconsciously quells
    the concerns discussed above."

    that is unapologetically peddled here really got me thinking: conceding how problematic
    these are (for the reasons you have mentioned), might we not see them as expressing
    a certain wistfulness, loss even?  That is, at precisely the historical moment
    when urban Indian families are least likely to conform to the \"model\" of joint
    family, housebound bahu, \"traditional values\" etc., at precisely that moment
    we have a plethora of such serials, typically with a viewership of women over
    40 (I find the (e.g.) SRK love story even more problematic because its regressive
    values are masqueraded as liberalism, and peddled even to the young).  Nothing
    wrong with a 40 or 50+ viewership, but these serials are synonymous with the \"auntie
    crowd\", and at least they do what they do overtly and not covertly.  And the
    serials themselves testify to how \"broken\" the joint family \"model\" is from
    the perspective of India's upwardly mobile, by virtue of their depictions of hopelessly
    dysfunctional and even psychotic families.  Did even Shah Jahan's sons hate each
    other this much?  LOL!  [I have not yet been able to come across data on
    viewership of these serials across different demographic segments.  I would be
    interested to ponder the extent to which the serials' viewership is comprised
    of people who continue to subscribe to the model presented as ideal, namely they
    live in a joint family, all the bells and whistles, etc.]"

  content: "Qalandar:  \"might we not see them as expressing a certain wistfulness,
    loss even? That is, at precisely the historical moment when urban Indian families
    are least likely to conform to the &ldquo;model&rdquo;
    of joint family, housebound bahu, &ldquo;traditional values&rdquo;
    etc., at precisely that moment we have a plethora of such serials, typically with
    a viewership of women over 40 (I find the (e.g.) SRK love story even more problematic
    because its regressive values are masqueraded as liberalism, and peddled even
    to the young).\"  Interesting observation. I think it has to do with the
    whole globalization-modernity-cum juxtaposed with \"Indian values\" rhetoric.
    Meaning, these characters are all a bunch of wealthy, capitalistic, consumption
    night-mare families, but they have the \"Indian\" values in tact-- which are the
    things you have mentioned. Essentially, what's being churned out by the mass media
    (which globally disseminates this Indian pop culture) is this: conformity wrapped
    up in lots of gold jewelry, absurdly big bindhis, layers of heavy make-up, incense
    smoke from pujas, and C.R.E.A.M. These serials embody the middle class's obsession
    with identity in the face of having lots of paisa, and the serials provide a comforting
    message: you don't really have to change or modify anything at all-- just keep
    spending away and hyper-inflate everything.   Re: viewership, it's not only
    40 something socialites watching these soaps. It's women AND men (yes, men sitting
    with their wives following each twist and turn of the plot with bated breath)
    not only in India, but also in Pakistan and in the diaspora (not sure how popular
    they are in Bangladesh, etc,).  Random note, but the ubiquity of the lovely
    saadi in Indian soaps has sparked a fashion trend in Pakistan. Long live the Desi
    Soap Empire."

  content: "Qalandar:  \"I think the Hindi film industry has become MORE conformist
    over the last 15-20 years\"  Yeah, but filums from back then were conformist
    as well. Silsila, for example, took on adulterous liasons with past lovers and
    shamelessly audacious flirting during Holi-- all of which does occur-- but in
    the end, what happens? Everyone goes back to their current spouses, and this time,
    they WANT to be with their spouses!!  Or another film with Rajesh Khanna
    (when he looked quite dapper). I think Asha Parekh or Jaya Pradha was the heroine.
    Anyway, in this film, Rajesh is a handsome Army fauji. He loves Asha, they have
    sex, she remains pregnant, he dies. But wait-- they had a mandhir shaadi in the
    Himalayas (or was it Kashmir?), so even if they don't have a marriage certificate,
    they were husband and wife in Bhagwan's eyes, and the kid's not illegitimate,
    and thus, woman and child earn our sympathy.  Mind you, it's fine by me
    if you have pre-marital sex etc, but clearly, it's not ok for Bollywood, which
    has to sanction  love affairs with God's blessings.  Though Saalam-Namaste
    arguably discusses pre-marital sex, living with your lover, madamji getting pregnant,
    blah blah. But tin the end, conformity rolls in."

  content: "Agreed on Silsila etc. (which I actually see as the film that prefigures
    the conformist crap of the 1990s and beyond; aside: the film has interestingly
    enough had an amazing 'afterlife\" in Pakistan, and the influence-counterinfluence
    of Yash Chopra and Haseena Moin is one of the most under-analyzed connection around
    IMO; the creative linkage was finally made explicit in Veer-Zaara)-- but I didn't
    really mean \"conformity\" solely in the sense of sexual mores (there I would
    agree that those films were more conformist -- or actually that what is \"conformist\"
    for the core audience of Hindi films as shifted; the \"core audience\" today is
    a demographic fraction of what it was back in the day, i.e. the \"pan-Hindi\"
    audience is a thing of the past), but in the sense of political conformity.  I
    think that several films of the 1950s and 1970s (not really the 1960s) were nowhere
    near as politically complacent as so many contempory \"big films\" are (although
    of course there are exceptions: Lage Raho Munnabhai, although it's \"edge\" is
    perhaps rendered palatable by virtue of soft comedy and a saccharine resolution)...  Page
    3 to be honest I did not like much (I dislike virtually everything Madhur Bhandarkar
    has directed, although Page 3 was waaaaay better than his other offerings, like
    Satta, Traffic Signal, and Corporate)...given your screen name, you'll forgive
    me when I say that I much preferred Fellini's original to Page 3!  Superb
    thoughts on the serials phenom: will need to re-visit and digest slowly..."

    acurate, I enjoyed the actors, especially the young man playing Akbar, the music,
    the story-line, and the colorful costumes.  I also liked Akbar's message - there
    is just too much hate in the world today and it is good whenever someone is trying
    to bring people together in peace.  Let's just enjoy it!

  content: There are so many flaw in the movie.Akbar's(Ak) mother was not in favour
    of Jodhabai's(JD) wedding.She and her sister in law Gulbadan,who plays a very
    important role in Ak's life was in favour of Ak's wives Ruqaya and Salima.It was
    Ak who in order to favour Hindus married JB.Infact Ak is a person who very much
    respects his mother.Akbar wives name is not mentioned in any of the chronicle.His
    hindu wives are usually adressed as daughter of so and so.Infact Ak does't describe
    any of his wife personally like his son,he is a person who tries to maintain equality
    in every part of his life,let it be his subjects or his household.So his rajput
    wife name may be Jodha bai,Hirabai or anything else which does,nt matter.Some
    historrians claim that daughter of Raja Bharmals is jahangir's mother who was
    given a title Mariyam Zambani.It is the only mentioning of name in Akbarnama.There
    is a controversy whether Raja Bharmals daughter is Jahangirs mother or not,for
    Blochmann says that she is Jodpur rani not Raja Bharmals daughter.Even in his
    memoir Jahangir mentions Man Singh aunt i.e.Raja Bharmals daughter as a lady in
    his fathers household who is connected by marriage to Ak and not as his mother.
    Ak unlike Jhangir or shah jahan does not keeps runing behind any single lady and
    neglect a court meeting as shown in the movie.Maham Agna was not against the wedding.It
    was she who brings Ak's harem(his remaining wives)to the place where the wedding
    took place and JB was placed one among his wives and he pushed to his capital
    asking his harem to follow.Maham agna' death was due to her affection to her son
    AdhamK.After her sons death she mourned for 40 days and died.She was not in a
    mood to do all the cheap conspiracy.Bagwan das brother of JB who was a very powerful
    officer in Ak's court was not given importance.The controversy with the ulamas
    was after Maham Agna life time and was not against JB,it was against Ak's numerous
    wedding which was against the law of islam.The ulamas was against Ak having more
    than 4 wives.They wanted Ak to have only 4 offical wives and the remaining as
    concubines.He was against this,he wanted all his ladies to have status of wife
    to favour matrimonial alliances.Ulamas were thrown out by Ak which they deserve
    it.They disturbed Ak in ruling the empire and in his religious tolerance policy.  Ak
    was a very great and powerful emperor.Nobody had the guts to challenge him like
    Sharufudin,wrongly protrayed in the movie.Infact it was Ak who challenged a Bengal
    rebellion,Daud in a single combat to avoid war.Hearing this Daud was so sacred
    that he ran away from the scene overnight.If Ak's descendant are powerful they
    should sue the movie for this scene,for in Aks time there was no rebelion who
    had the guts to talk to him.Infact the moment they hear Akb is coming they just
    ran away from the suitation.The movie is just a imaginary story with 2 char by
    name Akbr &amp;JB.The director in no way has read Akbarnama.He should hv taken
    a movie about jahangir or Shahjahan.By Sitapalamu ujain

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2008/02/jodhaaakbarposter.jpg' alt='Jodhaa Akbar Poster courtesy of Raver' width='500'/>"Gowarikar came before the media with half a dozen history books and said that he researched the subject thoroughly before making the film." You will just have to imagine my cheshire cat grin upon reading that sentence in an otherwise eye-rolling reportage on the <a href="http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/feb/16jodhaa.htm">"controversy"</a> surrounding Ashutosh Gowariker's bollywood spectacular <a href="http://www.jodhaaakbar.com/">Jodhaa Akbar</a>. I want every director of every historical movie to come with such arsenal to press conferences. </p>
<p>The movie, which I had the pleasure of seeing, along with two dear friends, at a run-down, mob-front, theater on the north side of Chicago, is underwhelming. Purportedly, it is the story of the Mughal emperor, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/mughalempire_3.shtml">Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar</a> (1556-1605) and his "romance" with the Rajput princess Jodhaa. The controversy seems to be in the realm of that pesky popular memory and history. Apparently, the offending parties claim that Jodha Bai is the Rajput wife of Jahangir - Akbar's successor - rather than Akbar's wife. And that brings some dishonor to some one. I really stopped reading after a while.</p>
<p>The movie doesn't deserve any controversy. Irfan Habib and Muhammad Amin have the right attitude as historians: "<a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20080218&fname=Akbar+(F)&sid=1">... nothing to get worked up about"</a>. Because if historians are indeed to huff and puff, the one-on-one combat sequences for all of Hindoostan are far more an egregious crime against history than whether Jodha Bai was Akbar's wife or daughter in law. Man Singh, Pleez. Akbar did have (a number of) Rajput wives, and other wives, and not every one's name is recorded. The one from the movie is named only by her given title, <i>Maryam-e Zaman</i> (Mary of the Times), in the medieval sources. A title that gave 19th century popular colonial narrators all kinds of wrong ideas about Christian influences on Akbar. </p>
<p>What I did find more troublesome than Jodha Bai, was the particular brand of Hindu-secularism at display in the movie. Wherein the open-ness of Akbar is needed only to give triumphal space for the Hindu dieties. And while Outlook India notes that this movie is the most noted example of an intercommunal romance where the <i>man</i> is muslim, I simply noted that every villain in the movie is a devout Muslim. Jodhaa Akbar, is a story about contemporary India and the world we live in, not about Akbar the Mughal King.</p>
<p>As teaching tool, I appreciated the bits of social and court historical display available in some scenes - the Diwan-i Aam, the Parcheesi, the night camps - but the rest would have to be avoided outside of a class on popular history and memory. My favorite scene was the "throw him over head first". I dug.</p>
<p>For those who care, I have put the account made famous by British Orientalist about Jodhaa and Akbar, below the fold.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Here, then, is the account given by Vincent Smith - "the hegemonic historian of ancient India", as Inden pegged him - in his biography of Akbar written in 1909. It informs some bits of "history" of the movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>One night, Akbar, when on a hunting excursion, was Pilgrim-passing through a village near Agra when he happened to hear a party of Indian minstrels singing the praises of first Khwaja Muin uddin, the renowned saint buried at Ajmer, and was thus inspired to make a pilgrimage to the tomb of the holy man. Accordingly, in the middle of January 1562, he started for Ajmer with a small retinue, hunting on his way. At Deosa, midway between Agra and Ajmer, he received Raja Bihar Mall, the chief of Amber or Jaipur in Rajputana, who offered his eldest daughter to Akbar in marriage. The court made only a brief stay at Ajmir and returned by forced marches to Agra, leaving the heavy<br />
camp equipage to follow. The marriage was celebrated at Sambhar. Man Singh, nephew and adopted son of Raja Bhagwan Das, the heir of Raja Bihar Mall, was taken into the imperial service, and rose ultimately to high office. </p>
<p>The bride subsequently became the mother of Jahangir. Her posthumous official title, Maryam zamani (or -uz zamani), ' the Mary of the age', has caused her to be confounded sometimes with Akbar's mother, whose title was Maryam-makani,' dwelling with Mary'. The dust of Akbar's first Hindu consort lies in a fine mausoleum situated near Akbar's tomb at Sikandara. The building has been restored<br />
by judicious measures of conservation. </p>
<p>Although it has been asserted that Humayun had one Hindu consort, that lady, if she really existed, does not appear to have exercised any influence. Akbar's marriages with Hindu princesses, on the contrary, produced important effects both on his personal rule of life and on his public policy. His leanings towards Hinduism will be more conveniently discussed at a subsequent stage, and the effects<br />
of the Rajput matrimonial alliances on public affairs also will become more apparent as the story proceeds. But at this point of the narrative so much may be said, that the marriage with the Amber princess secured the powerful support of her family throughout the reign, and offered a proof manifest to all the world that Akbar had decided to be the Badshah of his whole people&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Hindus as well as Muhammadans. While the court was on its way back to Agra one of the keepers of the hunting leopards was convicted of stealing a pair of shoes. Akbar ordered the thief's feet to be cut off. </p>
<p>Later in life he would hardly have inflicted such a savage punishment for a petty theft. </p></blockquote>
<p>- <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y_BBAAAAIAAJ">Akbar, the Great Mogul</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend that you stick with the epic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054098/">Mughal-e Azam</a> (1960), one of the greatest movies ever, for your Mughliana romances for a while.</p>
