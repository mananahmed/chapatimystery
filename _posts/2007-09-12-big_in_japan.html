  content: These types of polls mean nothing to me.  Having worked in market research
    in the past, I conducted many such polls for corporations.  What I learned is
    that numbers are easily manipulated.

<p>There is a new <a href="http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/Pakistan%20Poll%20Report.pdf">poll</a> [pdf link] out that has details on Pakistani democracy, popularity of various national leaders and some other interesting tidbits. It also shows that Bush and Mush are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/11/poll.pakistanis/index.html">way unpopular</a> - even as UbL has held on to his appeal in the 18-35 demographic. Make of it what you will. </p>
