<p><b>update:</b></p>
<p>"It's a very Masala film". Those kids are too damn cute, btw.</p>

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg" alt="" />Just in time for Oscars, we saw the "<a href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/the-real-roots-of-the-slumdog-protests/">controversial</a>" crowd-pleaser last night. I loved it. Boyle & Tandan tip their hats to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296574/">Company</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379370/">Maqbool</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096028/">Salaam Bombay</a> in visual and thematic cues but I thought <i>Trainspotting</i> may have been the biggest influence. You should go read <a href="http://www.1984produkts.com/donkeyhottie/archives/2009/01/13/slumdog-millionaire-will-win-best-picture-and-thats-great/">moacir's excellent write-up</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>I have written here, before, of my love for Alberto Manguel's wondrous writing. His essay <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/feb/21/wandering-jew-history">The exile's library</a>, <i>Guardian</i> is just beautiful.<i> "The story of the tireless wanderer haunted my dreams. I didn't feel his fate as a curse; I thought how wonderful it would be to travel alone and endlessly, to visit every country in the world and to meet all sorts of extraordinary people; above all, to be able to read any book that fell into your hands."</i>
<li>Nick Cohen's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/22/cricket-allen-stanford">The sordid legacy of the end of the empire</a> fills you up on "Sir" Allen Stanford and his fake empire. "In June last year Sir Allen landed on the sacred turf of Lord's in a black helicopter bearing a crateful of dollars. The bills turned out to be replicas rather than the real McCoy, but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not smell a rat. Sir Allen then appeared to make good on his promise to inject tens of millions into the game. He invited the England team to a high-stakes tournament in Antigua, a country he seemed to own." Pathetic, ECB, pathetic.
<li>Eric Hobsbawm's reflections on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/feb/18/victor-kiernan-obituary">Victor Kiernan</a> and <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n04/hobs01_.html">Joseph Needham</a> are a must-read.
<li>"An airstrike by the United States-led military coalition killed 13 civilians and 3 militants last Tuesday in western Afghanistan, not &ldquo;up to 15 militants&rdquo; as was initially claimed by American forces, military officials here said Saturday." - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/asia/22afghan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">U.S. Concedes Afghan Attack Mainly Killed Civilians</a>
<li>Finally, the wonderful <i>Harper's Index</i> is now on-line. Here is what they have indexed on <a href="http://harpers.org/index/?q=ISLAM&go=Search">Islam</a>. Sample:<br />
 - "(12/98) Chances that a U.S. film with male Arab or Muslim characters depicts them as greedy, violent, or dishonest: 19 in 20<br />
 - (2/98) Chance that an American Muslim is of Arab descent: 1 in 5<br />
And, also: <a href="http://harpers.org/index/?q=Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.<br />
 -  (6/88) Percentage of all those killed or injured in terrorist bombings worldwide last year who were Pakistani: 45</p>
