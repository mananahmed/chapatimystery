  content: "[...] There have been previous announcements of the imposition of Nizam-e-Adl
    in Swat, but it is unclear if the people&#8217;s need for a justice system, any
    justice system, was met. But the issue of a justice system is distinct from what
    Mr Fazlullah &amp; Co are trying to establish. The Taliban agenda is to set up
    an Islamic state on the lines of Mullah Omar&#8217;s erstwhile regime in Kabul.
    Going by their electoral preference&#8212;for the secular Awami National Party&#8212;it
    is clear that the people of Swat don&#8217;t want that. But now that the Pakistani
    state has abandoned them, that&#8217;s likely to be what they are going to get.

  content: "Sepoy, Thanks for the Sultan-i-Rome&acirc;&euro;&trade;s paper. It helps
    a great deal to be able to know a bit of context.\r\n\r\nBeing so far away from
    Pakistan, it is very difficult to know what's actually going on there, what to
    believe and what not to believe. Reading Pakistani and American editorials, sometimes
    it feels like the sky is falling :-(\r\n\r\nJuan cole's latest post about Pakistan.
    He did a post earlier on about taking a deep breath on Pakistan. I hope Prof.
    Cole's confidence is not ill-placed.\r\nhttp://www.juancole.com/2009/04/readers-have-written-me-asking-what-i.html"

<p>Yesterday's announcement that Zardari has made a deal with the TNSM and installed "Islamic government" in Swat is all over the news. I talked, briefly, with <a href="http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/Program_wv.aspx?episode=32133">Jerome McDonald of Worldview</a> today.  My main point was that there exists a history - 1994, 1999, 2007 - of efforts to install a <i>Shari-Nizam-e-Adl</i> (Islamic Order of Justice) in Swat region. You can check my previous post on Swat to get a sense of this history, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/the_akond_of_swat.html">Akond of Swat</a>. </p>
<p>More importantly, an absolutely must-read is historian Sultan-i-Rome's paper, <a href="http://ipcs.org/pdf_file/issue/1542140255RP18-Rome-Swat.pdf"><i>Swat: A Critical Analysis</i></a> [pdf], IPCS Research Paper, January 2009. The paper provides a succinct historical and political overview and also introduces some of the key players. Must read. </p>
<p>Sultan-i-Rome is one of the major, if not the, historian of Swat valley. His monograph, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swat-State-1915-1969-Administrative-Socio-Political/dp/019547113X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234810628&sr=8-1">Swat State, 1915-1969: From Genesis to Merger: An Analysis of Political, Administrative, Socio-Political, and Economic Development</a> is key to building a historical overview of the crisis facing the state of Pakistan. I had thought of writing a proper review of the latter, but time slipped away. I will try and do it. </p>
