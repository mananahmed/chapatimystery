  content: "From the Markey article: \r\n<i>If members of the Pakistani army and the
    Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) retain ties to militant groups, including Taliban
    sympathizers, they do so as a hedge against abandonment by Washington. </i>\r\n\r\nEither
    Markey is talking completely out of the wrong orifice, or the Pakistani military/intelligence
    establishment is a completely unreliable ally. Is there any other way to read
    this?"

  content: "It's like liveblogging.....\r\n\r\nI'm reading the article, and I can't
    help but feel a little uncomfortable with the question of agency. I'm two-thirds
    of the way through it, and it seems like he's arguing that the Pakistani military
    establishment is going to the highest bidder, and the Administration strategy
    of throwing money at the problem (and they say Dems are \"tax and spend\"?!) is
    actually the smartest way to deal with a military/intelligence establishment which
    has no fundamental strategic interests outside of its own security and prosperity."

  content: OK, I got to the end. Call me thick, but I'm not sure how you thread the
    needle he's laid out, where nothing the US says critical of Pakistan is productive,
    but what the US needs to do is criticize the <i>right</i> elements to get Pakistanis
    to do the right thing in spite of being told "do whatever"....

  content: 'Sepoy:  I can see where you''re going with this-- to a point.  Initially
    I wouldn''t have thought that M.I.A. would be able to influence Markey or vice
    versa, but the fact that she has started to sing some lyrics in Hindi shows a
    growing interest in the northerly part of the Subcontinent.  At the same time,
    I don''t know if she''s speaking a ''language'' that Markey ''understands.'''

  content: 'Okay, I have just listened to ''Jimmy'' 10+ times and I''m starting to
    get what she''s doing here.  At first I thought M.I.A. using a song from Disco
    Dancer and singing in Hindi was a shrewd mass-marketing move geared toward her
    growing international Desi base.  But now I realize the connection you are making:
    Could it be that by singing in Hindi she is actually addressing the General himself,
    and requesting that he come ("<em>aa jaa, aa jaa, aa jaa</em>" to the table and
    talk to ''M.I.A.''-- not she herself, but her persona, which represents a multicultural
    transnational citizenhood?'

  content: Listened to 'Jimmy' 5 or 6 more times and now I am less convinced by my
    previous argument.  Frankly, I'm not so sure that the Jimmy in the song is meant
    to be a military dictator, but rather some kind of NGO relief worker 'everyman,'
    whom she is requesting to return 'home' where he is needed, in other words, Jimmy
    is that concerned international citizen who is wasting his time trying to fix
    things in Darfur, etc., and who had also better cast a watchful eye on what's
    going on in the domestic sphere.  Now the question to answer is who is the interlocutor
    making this request of him?  Sepoy, I wonder if you are slyly suggesting in your
    post that the narrator or 'I' character in the song is not M.I.A. herself, but
    rather a figure occupying a domestic sphere defined by Pakistan, such as Musharraf
    himself, hence your title Kala General, by which you do not mean that the General
    is black, but that he is semiotically connected to M.I.A.'s new album Kala.  Alternatively,
    perhaps 'Jimmy' is intended to be BB and 'I' is Musharraf. This would explain
    the reference to static on the satellite phone of 'Jimmy.'  Thence Markey's need
    to engage with this argument if he is to understand the factor of civil society
    in Pakistan.

    already on CM payroll, I would hire you in an instance. Top $$s.\r\n\r\nThe only
    thing I would add is that Markey also needs the Sholay-Disco Dancer-MIA connection.
    Sholay is where Markey is currently stuck in [Gabar Singh = al Qaeda, Thakur =
    US, Jai/Veru=Civil/Military forces in Pakistan]. Rest is easy."

  content: "Have you guys heard MIA's cover of Zeppelin's \"Kashmir?\" I think there's
    a whole statement being made her about the interdesi phenomenon and its relationship
    to post-imperial Asia, as well as the Colonial guilt that keeps hillbillies like

<p>The July/Aug 2007 issue of <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org">Foreign Affairs</a> contains <a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/10682/daniel_markey.html">Daniel Markey</a>'s <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701faessay86407/daniel-markey/a-false-choice-in-pakistan.html">A False Choice in Pakistan</a>. It is a clear-eyed assessment of Pakistan -  and US options going forward. I highly recommend it. I don't necessarily agree with everything - Markey's analysis has no place for non-Army actors and I am not entirely satisfied with his reading of Army's role in Pakistani civil society, and I think that skews his conclusion a little - but this is the sort of advice I hope our politicians are basing their policy on [Hint: Obama - whose essay, <i>Renewing American Leadership</i>, also appears in the same issue. Also, can we blame Obama for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-US-Afghan-Pakistan.html?_r=1 &oref=slogin">The General's bail-out from the jirga</a>?].</p>
<p><a href="/archives/better_with_tablas/dancehall_insurgency_tiger_style.html">M.I.A.</a>'s new album <a href="http://www.miauk.com/info/?p=12">Kala</a> [link will cause blindness] is A for Awesome [so far]. Thanks to moacir, for showing me <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_Dk_F98cU">Jimmy</a> with its R. D. Burman/Disco Dancer inspired goodness (<i>Jimmy/Come back Jimmy/When you go Rwanda Congo/take me on ya genocide tour/take me on a truck to Darfur/take me where you would go</i> can only be the ultimate come-on for loving that makes one crazy)</p>
<p>Over the weekend I intend on introducing Daniel Markey to M.I.A. Then, we shall get somewhere. CM will be returning to both of these - in greater detail - in the not so distant future.</p>
