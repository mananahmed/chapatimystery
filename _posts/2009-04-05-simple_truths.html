  content: "Title remind me of Tariq Ali's \"Can Pakistan Survive\" which came out
    in the early 1980s - I picked it up at a 2nd hand bookstore a few months ago and
    am leafing through it now. I was always sceptical of books with these titles since
    they invaraibly make grand claims which might not be borne out by events - can't
    forget Selig Harrison's \"India the Dangerous Decades\" from the 60s which foretold
    an imminent implosion there, that never quite happened. But Ali's book though
    20 years old still sounds so fresh and relevant in some of its critque of the
    Army, the role of the US in undermining Pakistani democracy, the tensions created
    by Afghanistan and the problems created by the rise of Islamist politics.\r\n\r\n20
    years ago when Ali's book came out and Brian Lapping could start the episode on
    South Asia in the BBC series \"End of Empire\" with the comment that by any standards
    India was a moderate success as a nation-state and Pakistan a failure - these
    judgements would have seemed out of place, made by generalists who either over-simplified
    a complex picture or had not freed themselves from the last clutches of Orientialism.
    Today, though, the picture looks bleaker and their judgments/criticisms seem less
    ridiculous. Don't agree with them, still, but forced to take the weight of their
    arguements a lot more seriously now."

  content: "Conrad, I agree.  Every generation seems to need its \"Asian Drama.\"
    \ At one level the discourse on state failure is functional for extracting resources
    from the US (and for legitimating US assistance and/or intervention in a range
    of weak states).  In this regard, the discourse on state failure operates in a
    manner similar to non-alignment.  At another level, it would be irresponsible
    to ignore the fact that states like Pakistan (and several others in South Asia)
    have not been delivering basic social services to large segments of their population
    for some time.  In my eyes, this does not constitute \"failure\" per se; it is
    \ unfortunately the normal state of affairs in most of the low-income countries.
    \ \r\n\r\nReal state failure, in the sense of a complete collapse is certainly
    still a remote possibility, however, the emergence of shadow states (in the sense
    developed by Stacey Hunt) in regions that were never fully incorporated by the
    post-colonial state are worthy of our attention.  If for no other reason than
    for the impact on what Hunt terms \"el pueblo\" that exists under these dual regimes.
    \ \r\n\r\nWhat escapes the attention of the popular media, which remains fixated
    on the failings of South Asian states to meet a Eurocentric conception of sovereignty,
    is the ways in which the East Asian and South Asian states are developing new
    forms of sovereignty through the development of road networks in neighboring regimes.
    \ I wonder why it is that Asian states are always measured by their inadequacies
    rather than their innovations."

  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nPopular media generally assume that areas which don't interest
    the elites in the home country they publish in are unimportant.  So if something
    is important to India, but not to the US, there will be a strong tendency to ignore
    it.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that what strikes us in the US as \"state failure\"
    seems to strike Indians as the Pakistani state making selective use of its own
    apparent failures to avoid being punished.  They think when the LeT launches a
    terrorist attack in Mumbai, it is not so much evidence of the inability of the
    Pakistani state to control terrorism as the unwillingness of the Pakistani state
    to accept responsibility for acts that it could control.  \r\n\r\nI'm concerned
    that the Pakistani state may not be failing in its aims, but that its aims may
    not be compatible with the Europe derived concepts of sovereignty we are used
    to.  Also, it is possible that after the storming of Lal Masjid, that many of
    the Pashtun tribesman have lost their probably always moderate allegiance to central
    authority, leaving Pakistan drifting toward civil war.\r\n\r\nBut I can ramble
    on.  If you want to read more from me, I have a blog at:\r\n\r\nhttp://rememberjenkinsear.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nIf
    not, thanks for reading this.\r\n\r\nRay,"

  content: "Ray, \r\n\r\nHi.  Doesn't your read of the media beg the question: who
    influences what is of interest to elites in a particular country?  This leads
    us back in large part to the media itself.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of the popular
    media works within standard narrative structures (e.g the figure-fulfillment model,
    the white man's burden, the noble savage, etc.), very few seek to challenge their
    readers to think critically.   The best that the popular media does is add a bit
    of nuance and sophistication within generally formulaic story arcs."

<p><img src="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/05cover-395jpg.jpeg"/ align='left'>James Traub's cover-story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05zardari-t.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Can Pakistan be Governed?</a> is actually fairly nuanced and one of the better things to have appeared in NYT recently.</p>
<p>More important, is the cover image for the magazine. I like to compile short-lists of reigning conventional wisdoms on Pakistan, and this cover is a beauty. Check it:<br />
PERILOUS<br />
ANARCHIC<br />
BROKE<br />
VIOLENT<br />
SPLINTERING<br />
CORRUPT<br />
ARMED<br />
GOVERNABLE?</p>
<p>The casual glance at this list confirms every fear in our secret liberal (or neo-con) hearts even as the 8000 words inside proffer a more complex world. But who has time for complexity? Or use.</p>
<p><b>update:</b> Anil gets the brownie for Wordle'ing the Traub article. Thanks, mate!<br />
