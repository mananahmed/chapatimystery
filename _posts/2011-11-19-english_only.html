  content: "A superb piece indeed, sepoy, thanks for bringing it to our attention.
    \ The way it builds up, ceding by the end to the piece from Kafila, is just masterful.
    \ And wounding.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I read \"Inquilaab\" in Mumbai, and can definitely
    attest to the derisive and dismissive way in which Taslima Nasreen is discussed.
    \ I think it is more sober, and moderate on the Ahmadi question (that is, it doesn't
    address it as much as the papers Mr. Naim cites apparently do), but apart from
    that, the 9-point list sums it up perfectly.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do think
    that the Ahmadi question might be broader than one of the Urdu press -- in my
    experience, the vast majority of sub-continental Muslims I have met/am related
    to, betray appalling attitudes towards Ahmadis.  In fact, many who wouldn't be
    caught dead making bigoted statements about (e.g.) Hindus, routinely make casually
    dismissive comments about Ahmadis.  The atmosphere of incitement against this
    sect has been legitimized to such an extent that it has become part of the air
    Muslims breathe.  One interesting question (that I don't know the answer to) is,
    does this mania afflict the Malayalam and Southern Indian Muslim writings too?
    \ Certainly, my impression (stereotype?) has long been that Muslims from Kerala
    and Tamil Nadu tend to be about as Sunni as they come, and I wonder if this is
    an issue that has surfaced there."

  content: I don't know why it is necessary for a Muslim to speak and write in Urdu.
    Isn't it possible to be a Muslim without knowing Urdu? I don't think Chinese Muslims
    have to read and write in Urdu.

  content: "\"Actually, let's face it, as long as Muslims are not
    being torched by Hindu mobs, the Indian left-liberal could not care less about
    what happens to Muslims. And when people who call themselves Muslim are sat upon
    by Muslim hegemons, the Indian Left-Liberal really does not give a damn.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    whole article can be summed up by the above quote.\r\nLiberals are just like Congress
    party (due to pakistan) codling in a vote bank, given personal law separate from
    everyone else.  What do you expect after 60 years of this.\r\nIf there is no integration,
    no social compact. \r\nMinorities can only excel when they work like Jews in America
    or Protestants in France.\r\nThose muslim that liberal can adopt to the new world
    order so obviously they\r\ndon't care about their poor brethren  same kind of
    bs argument is laid upon the upward mobile middle class of Black Americans.  At
    least India is not creating laws and jailing all the poor muslims like the US
    has done since 70s."

  content: I am a muslim and most importantly a keralite. Why I stressed myself as
    a keralite just because, we keralites never used to speak urdu even among muslims.
    The reason is because, Malayalam is our mother tongue and we used to converse
    using that. So, I don't feel it is a necessity that muslims must know urdu just
    because language is for communication purpose and not for creating divisions among
    people.

<p>Naim Sahib, one of my teachers at Chicago, has a must-must-must read "rant" (as he puts it) in Outlook India. I really think it is one of  his best and critically lays bare a key disconnect between the intellectual engagements within Urdu and English presses when it comes to matters of Muslims and Islam. I think almost everything he writes, holds true for the case of Pakistan. Please read, print, and frame it. </p>
<p>C. M. Naim, "<a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?279021">The Deadening Silence of Good Intentions</a>", <em>Outlook India</em>, Nov 18, 2011</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me put my argument this way. In Kerala, for example, local Muslims at all levels of the society not only speak the language of the region but also think, argue, and communicate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with each other as well as their non-Muslim peers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;in that language. The same can be said to be true for the Muslims of so many other states. A Muslim professor of sociology in Bengal will not only be conversant in Bengali but also very much aware of what was being said or written in Bengali on the issues that should be of concern to him. Likewise, a Muslim intellectual in Gujarat would not hesitate to jump into some cultural debate in the Gujarati press because she would most likely be a part of its readership. These persons of my examples are unlikely to be entirely circumscribed by the English media in their regions. That situation, I aver, does not exist in Delhi, U.P., and Hyderabad. (I leave out Bihar and Madhya Pradesh since I know nothing about the Urdu press there.) Over the last five or six decades, the educated Urdu-speaking Muslim elite in Delhi and U.P., particularly those equipped with higher education in social sciences and thus expected to hold and express considered views on socio-political and economic issues, have become cut off from the Urdu-medium discourse around them. Those who seriously read and write on contemporary issues do so almost exclusively in English. That disconnect does not affect their wellbeing either professionally or personally. Most remain oblivious of it, and a few cheerfully so. Many of them, in my experience, express a little disdain when Urdu press comes up in conversation. Of course, that is to their loss. But, more importantly, it is a greater loss to the general Muslim population of the region.</p></blockquote>
