  content: I read your artilce on Sen when researching mine on my blog "India Indeed".
    It seems like a lot of people support him because of his stellar resume and public
    service. I do believe that he is being targeted by the government and being unfairly
    imprisoned but one needs to really examine if and what his links might be with
    the organization before declaring him innocent because he is a great Pediatrician
    or human rights activist.
