  content: "Sepoy: I do not disagree with your wider point about Taliban violence,
    the political nature of it, etc.  However, I wouldn't completely disregard the
    theological aspect of it: I have heard multiple people (not affiliated with the
    Taliban, just bigots) refer to Shiites and Sufis as hereitics, inifidels, etc.
    \ In order for even such political violence to be executed and acquire legitimacy,
    surely the de-humanization and demonization implicit in a certain kind of theology
    is useful (i.e. useful for that political project)?  Yes the violence is political,
    but theology does not exist in its own vacuum, and over time it may be coopted
    by this or that politics (in fact that has been so throughout history).  [I
    of course can only react with dismay to the notion that \"Sufism\" is a good candidate
    for being the \"authorized\" good Islam category that we-in-the-West should plug.
    \ Leaving aside all other notions, what could be more destructive of this most
    local, most liminal of \"-isms\", not even a true \"-ism\"?]"

  content: PS-- I certainly think the insights from the many SufismS of the sub-continent
    can help combat the rising tide of religious fanaticism and "orthodoxy" (the sad
    thing is that in the sub-continent, "sufism" is increasingly seen as the province
    of illiterates and the gullible -- no matter that the social classes condescended
    to seem to have done a far better job of preserving a tolerant, easy going ethic
    than the so-called "educated" middle classes who have succumbed in droves to the
    siren call of faux-Arabised "real" Islam), but this sort of engagement and religious
    ferment cannot be the product of a policy of "sponsoring" certain islams.  Truly,
    we learn from history that we learn nothing from history...

  content: I don't know the history as well but isn't this a tired working of the
    Sufis as some sort of cuddly Muslims that the West can feel comfortable with?
    I would have thought that in this region it ignores the actual important role
    some Sufi orders had in mounting violent resistant to what they saw as unjust
    regimes - such as the Naqshbandis. I beleive at least one major Sufi cleric took
    part in 1857 (forget the name alas! I seem to recall an Eric Stokes article on
    this figure). There seems to be a sliding assumption that Sufism= pacifism, which
    wasn't really the case. Unproblematically anyway.

  content: "Hi Sepoy, Sepoy,  Well noted.  Someday, one day, if and
    when all this settles down, one should make a list of all those folks across the
    globe who leveraged careers and mileage out of analyzing terrorism, Islam, the
    Middle East, South Asia, nuclear threats, fundamentalism, fascism-- all the neocons,
    thinktankers, op-ed pundits, consultants for cable news networks,  ex-defence
    dudes, contractors, security forces, parachute journalists, terrorism experts.  The
    only comparable hustle I can think of is the lucrative business of solving global
    poverty, where, too, in similar vein, fortunes have been made and careers embellished.
    \   I am routinely amazed to discover things about South Asian culture from
    folks who have spent all of five minutes there. Friedman's metaphors about the
    Indian mindset, gleaned from women swimming in the Taj or his entrepreneur friends,
    being a case in point.   This really is an exemplar of the mystery of ministry,
    the alchemic assumption of authority.  On a related note, Dalrymple has
    arrogated for himself the position of deciding which South Asians writers are
    truly authentic representatives of South Asian experience.  Thus in praising Daniyal
    Mueenuddin's recent collection of short stories, he deems it authentic while dismissing
    Amitav Ghosh for imagining Bihar from Brooklyn (Dalrymple does not name Ghosh
    but the reference is clear. Ever since Amitav Ghosh swatted his objections to
    The Sea of Poppies aside aside, Dalrymple has been smarting and, I suspect, itching
    to get his own back).  Dalrymple, in this regard, is one with the other
    experts who assume that South Asian politics, culture, and history can be easily
    parsed, understood, and reprogrammed.  The specific claims of various folks may
    be different, and some such commentators may be well intentioned. But the principle
    is the same. The colonialist legacy that motivates this approach is easily identified.  The
    East is still a career it seems.  Best"

    probably find every sort of perspective -- pacifist, militarist, disgustingly

    1857 - I haven't read it since being an undergrad but I remember that article
    on a Sufi figure who prominently resisted the British in 1857 impressed me, will
    need to pull the name out!  <i>Thus in praising Daniyal Mueenuddin's
    recent collection of short stories, he deems it authentic while dismissing Amitav

    get his own back).</i>  In the FT review of Mueenuddin's work he mentions
    Ghosh explictly by name as well as Sea of Poppies; so the reference is really
    explicit. It really sounds snarky by Dalrymple; and I was surprised since one
    can make many criticisms of Ghosh, but this isn't one of them. I haven't read
    Sea of Poppies but anyone who has read Glass Palace or In an Antique land will
    know that Ghosh is very well attuned to his subjects and has a strong gift for
    empathy. I would be surprised if Dalrymple's criticsm has any basis."

    as long as your discussing violence as being political rather than religious,

  content: "As a bourgeois white guy who has made a career of the East, I will make
    two points. 1) Since when has theology not been political? Of course the Taliban
    advances its agenda through force, but the force is used to a particular purpose.
    The blowing up Rahman Baba's shrine is what Feith says it is,
    a deliberate attempt to delegitimize any but the Taliban's version of Islam. To
    my mind at least, it couldn't be clearer that shutting down music stores and forcing
    artists to flee certainly comes from a particular understanding of the role of
    music in Islam. The problem is that \"the role of music\" in Pakistan is allowed
    to be discussed with reference to Islam at all. As for Dalrymple, he has been
    shilling for islamist fascism and recycling complacent Pakistani opinion regarding
    it for some years now. As with his treatment of Bernard Henri-Levy's book \"Who
    Killed Daniel Pearl?,\" Dalrymple is always ready to criticize anyone who objects
    to the Islamization of Afghanistani and Pakistani politics."

  content: "Good points sepoy. Sympathetic outsiders looking for heroes (or reporters
    who need to cut the length of their articles) paint sufis as heroes, disassociating
    them with the complexities that surround their traditions and their relations
    with Islam and the societies in which they exist. Painting sufis as heroes is
    a mistake.  However, we should recognize that many of ideals in the sufi
    traditions can be used to combat the abuse of Islam by the taliban - oh wait,
    someone already said that. i agree with qalandar about the sufi traditions being
    helpful against fantaticism (duh!) But I disagree referring to those traditions
    as SufismS - i see where you're coming from, but c'mon - they still share enough
    in common to warrant a collective phrase, and though i know some people are against
    -isms, i think people educated on the topic know enough not to make the kinds
    of mistakes you allude to. People buying into some unhelpful version of it
    and becoming a druggie but trusting it because it's sufism is a problem - but
    i don't think changing the word would help  Politizing sufism is crazy -
    even though it has been done before - and westerners looking for a 'good' Islam
    are missing the point: Islam is Islam, there is no bad or good version  Islam's
    good far outweighs it's bad - 99% of the bad comes from the institutions created
    to interprut and control interpretation of the Qur'an institutions are lame.  i
    feel like an idiot saying this, but outsiders with no knowledge of what goes on
    their need to understand: the taliban is not bad because it takes things from
    the qur'an which are bad. they're bad because they're a bunch of child-brainwashing
    warlords who dont give a damn about human life.  as to the masses, the ones
    who are terrorized by the taliban, sepoy's right: they need protection, and ali
    akbar khan, while giving them art, won't be at their doors fighting off legions
    of insurgents with sufi magic"

  content: "the practical problem with all this sufism-promotion is that it is seductive
    but ultimately already defeated in urban pakistan.  i went to visit a shrine
    with my class - that of Baba Ganj-e-Shakar Farid in Pakpattan. A lot of my classmates
    were shocked, and even outraged at the 'biddat' on display.   while it's
    easy to romanticize sufis, most of urban and middle class Pakistan has already
    decided that they are completely uncomfortable with any religious practice commonly,
    and perhaps stereotypically, associated with sufis. the reason being that such
    practices remind them too much of the practices they see in the indian movies
    they love so much, and anything whiffing of hinduism has no place in islam.  if
    we are going to have any use of the sufis, it would be of the sort who roamed
    the country sides railing against those in power and creating dissent and sowing
    radicalism.  but i have a feeling the ISI has already jailed them, and funded
    splinter factions of their movements whose purpose will soon run out."

<p>Doug Feith, who is certainly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/29/guantanamo-bay-torture-inquiry">prosecutable</a>, had an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/opinion/30feith.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">op-ed</a> in NYT yesterday. <strike>The most revealing  thing about it was the title, Radio Free Swat. Vietnam is, after all, the proper framework.</strike> </p>
<p>This Sufi-fights-Taliban meme needs some serious pushback. <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Faith-and-Ecstasy.html">Nicholas Schmidle</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/08/islam-pakistan-rahman-baba">Will Dalrymple</a> have also written recently along these lines. The argument is certainly a valid reading of Islamic traditions in South Asia and there is much to recommend in it. I agree with it in historical terms. But, the problem is that this conflates apples with grenades. The "Taliban" are not arguing on theological grounds and blowing up Rahman Baba's shrine is not a religious act. It is political violence. And as such, it is determined to intervene in the social fabric of the region. Going from this to arguing that Baba Rahman documentaries will turn the tide against armed militant is just freakin' loopy. The power of shutting down music stores and forcing artists to flee does not come from espousing some particular understanding of the role of music in Islam. It comes from the Klashnikovs and the warlords who distribute them. The civilian populations of Swat or Uch do not need convincing that Rahman Baba or Bhittai are tolerant and nice. They need a state that can protect them, and their monuments, from guns. So, let's not make this some Sufi vs Taliban romance.</p>
