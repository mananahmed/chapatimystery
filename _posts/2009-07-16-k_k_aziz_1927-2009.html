  content: I had met Professor Aziz in the autumn of 2005 to become his admirer straight
    away. I had headed a team of history students to Lahore to interact with the social
    science students of Furrukh Khan at LUMS. One of the students on the last day
    suggested to me to meet Aziz Saheb. Accordingly an appointment was fixed at 4:00PM
    at his Johar Town residence. We were instructed to be on time so as to avoid any
    emarassment. Aziz Saheb was always serious about time. We were five minutes advance
    and the man in his light blue shirt and grey pant was there in the porch of the
    home. Meeting was instant hit. The man had met us not because we were the students
    of history but because we were from the city of his dreams Amritsar. Since we
    were about 15 persons and he did not have any idea of our numbers, he asked us
    to accomodate ourselves whereever we could. Mrs Zarina Aziz the most genteel lady
    I have ever met began to look after us and Aziz Saheb sat on the Sofa and began
    to speak about his memories of Amritsar and Batala and while he talked his sobbing
    was unstoppable. He made most of us cry with emotions. We had met many other persons
    in Lahore and enjoyed their hospitality, for which the Lahoris are known for,  but
    this was an exceptional meeting. He spoke about the discipline of history and
    broached the idea of how history was being misintrepreted by vested interests.
    It was a very warm meeting. We remained at his home for two hours. In the meeting
    he expressed his desire to visit Amritsar. I agreed to do the needful and I did
    on my return. I cannot forget the moment when he came out to see us off. Right
    in front of the house he got hold of my hand and said, " Sharma look at the upper
    floor of the house, it is all vacant and when you come to Lahore come with your
    family and this is your home. Furrukh had opened for us the door to Pakistan and
    Aziz Saheb and his wife gave us a home. How could I forget these words. It was
    a passionate appeal of an affectionate couple. Then after we were in constant
    touch. Then he came to Amritsar for one week stayed with us delivered lectures
    at Guru Nanak Dev Universtiy. These are still remembered by students. He invited
    me and our family and we came to Lahore and stayed at his home. Mrs Sharma observed
    her Karva Chauth in lahore during that Journey. I t was remarkable as to how the
    Azizs treated us as their children. Aziz Saheb is no more,. Our heart goes out
    for Mrs Aziz. We wanted to meet her, but we have not been successful in that.
    Yes we have talked on phone. We still yearn to meet her. Allah alone knows when
    will this happen. Aziz Saheb was an exceptional man of qualities of head and heart.
    He will be missed by us for all times to come

<p>K. K. Aziz, one of the finest historians of Pakistan, is <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=188405">no more</a>. </p>
<p>It is a great loss. </p>
<p>I had planned on writing a fuller obit but Adil Najam has done a <a href="http://pakistaniat.com/2009/07/17/kk-aziz/">splendid job</a>.</p>
