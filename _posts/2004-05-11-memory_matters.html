<p><img src="/img/books.jpg" align=left hspace=6>This is hell week. Teaching today and thursday (lecture currently missing [i really hope no prospective employers ever read this blog and wise up to my shenanigans]); some html and <s>virii</s> viruses madness at work; and most of all a stack of books sky high on all desks around me. The reason is that I have to present at the Theory and Practice in South Asia Workshop on Thursday after my class. The title of the talk is <em>Contesting History: The Memory of Muhammad b. Qasim in Sindh</em>. Last night, I spend cuddling up with Pierre Nora and Maurice Halbwachs. Let me just say that these French love to gab. I am little apprehensive but that's ok. I will survive.<br />
It does mean that I see pink elephants everywhere (memory=pink elephants).<br />
So, expect little of me this week.<br />
Instead, go learn how the world works at <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/">They Rule 2004</a>: an excellent flash mapping program based on SEC filings of major corporations in the USA.<br />
Also, Thursday, we will have the election in India concluded. Things are looking up for Congress but I have a feeling that Vajpayee led NDA will prevail. So, keep an eye on that one.</p>
