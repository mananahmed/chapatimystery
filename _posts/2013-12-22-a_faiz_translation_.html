<p><strong><br />
Pain Will come, On Soft Feet.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In a little while when<br />
  once again,<br />
my heart will confront the thought<br />
of loneliness, what will I do?<br />
pain will come, on soft feet<br />
  carrying a red lamp </p>
<p>that pain    which beats a beat<br />
away<br />
from my heart </p>
<p>its flame will flare     in my side<br />
blazing onto my heart's wall<br />
each shadow's contour:<br />
   curl of hair<br />
   curve of cheek<br />
   desert of separation<br />
   garden of sights </p>
<p>we'll talk, then,<br />
my heart and I: </p>
<p>O heart, my heart<br />
this beloved you hold in your loneliness,<br />
is your guest but for a moment;<br />
    will leave.<br />
It's not the balm you seek<br />
for the savage flames it ignites ... </p>
<p>will depart,<br />
leaving only shadows behind that will, all night long<br />
shed your blood </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>This is war, O heart,<br />
no game this;<br />
each against your life, murderers all:<br />
   this hard night,<br />
   these shadows,<br />
   this loneliness.<br />
there can be no union between<br />
my heart, this pain. </p>
<p>Come.<br />
instead.<br />
Bring forth an amber raging with anger </p>
<p>Where is the Army of wrath? Call it.<br />
That Rose which burns through fire&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
     where is it?<br />
The one that has fervor, and movement, and strength too. </p>
<p>Our comrades, our battalions<br />
await us,<br />
beyond these dark miles<br />
our flames will surely tell them<br />
of our existence.<br />
It's fine even if they don't reach us, at least<br />
they will yell:<br />
how far lies the dawn. </p>
