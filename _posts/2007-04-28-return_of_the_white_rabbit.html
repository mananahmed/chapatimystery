  content: "Awesome response.  The \"dig\" against the mangling of the English language
    remains unpersuasive (because it does not address those who do not mangle it;
    plus by referring to Dirks ' \"polemics\" it confirms my hunch that Dalrymple's
    problem is with the latter's POLITICS more than anything else), but overall I
    am super glad that Dalrymple took the time to do this (I should note that none
    of the \"critics\" on the other thread suggested that Dalrymple was a \"pariah\"
    in academia, I think it was those who were standing up for his non-engagement
    with the \"subalternists\" who said so), and I thank both him and sepoy.\r\n\r\nDalrymple
    posits a connection between the mythmaking that passes for history in the subcontinent
    and the absence of credible \"popular\" histories.  To a certain extent I absolutely
    agree with him, which is why I am glad that there are signs that things are changing
    (Dalrymple being the most prominent example).  But surely there's more here?  Decades
    ago there were similarly no popular histories, but I suspect fewer people if any
    were referring to the Taj Mahal as a Shiva temple (btw, contrary to the insinuation
    here, I disagree that this is a generally held view in Delhi's middle classes).
    \ That is, Dalrymple ignores the political dimensions here:  it is striking to
    me that he is willing to place greater responsibility on those who do not write
    popular history than on those who have been spreading bigotry and propaganda,
    and a politics of hate, for decades.  i.e., should we be blaming Spivak or the
    RSS if such views have been gaining ground?\r\n\r\nThat being said: 40,000 copies
    in India in five months?  Wow, that is awesome.  That's the kind of thing we need
    more of -- and I submit we need more of it in the context of a book like The Last
    Mughal, rather than the White Mughals (because the latter is more readily assimilable
    to the sort of historiography that does not really challenge or subvert received
    myths).\r\n\r\nbtw, and I know I have mentioned this before: the focus on religious
    sentiment in 1857 (including a strongly Hindu militant edge along with a Muslim
    militant one), issues like cow slaughter, and Zafar's attempts to maintain communal
    harmony in Delhi, are all very much the focus of Rajat Kanta Ray's The Felt Community,
    a \"non-subalternist\" who nevertheless owes much to theory.  Would be curious
    what Dalrymple and other folks on these threads make of the book; seems to me
    it's a logical candidate for being referenced in/with TLM, and I wonder if Ray
    made use of any of the archives Dalrymple refers to."

  content: "WD: Thanks for posting a response to the out of control comment thread
    and to the review!  Now that's what I called engagement with your interlocutors.\r\n\r\nA
    few small points: \r\n\r\nPariah: I used the term in the specific context of the
    US South Asia studies environment which is dominated by the poco/pomo crowd, and
    didn't mean it it be seen as a general commentary on WD's place in academe.  The
    comments in the thread below were actually much kinder and more balanced than
    what I have heard said specifically about WD by faculty and grad students at major
    US institutions. At that point in my comment I was specifically addressing the
    notion that WD's bankability on bestseller lists somehow gave him a position of
    ascendancy that made it unseemly for him to malign or ignore the Subalterns, who
    are anything but subaltern in the most prestigious history departments in the
    US. D. Litt degrees are not awarded in the US, so I'm assuming that those degrees
    were conferred elsewhere.  In the settings I am familiar with, if WD were invited
    to give a talk, it would either be on invitation from an undergraduate South Asian
    Students' Association, or from scholars who are not South Asianists.  \r\n\r\nObfuscatory
    prose:  Even if Nick Dirks writes clearly, he most certainly does not write entertaining
    popular histories that will be bought up by the truckload by the reading public.
    \ There's still a huge difference between work produced primarily for an academic
    audience and work that is produced for the general public. Having lived long in
    the belly of the beast, I am deeply opposed to the specialist project of academia,
    which is endlessly perpetuated by the system of rewards, promotions, publications
    and reviews that underwrites success in universities. What use are all the training,
    research, insight, analytic skills that are developed by the scholar if she does
    no make the fruits of her labor available to the general public? I am not arguing
    specifically for WD or against ND when I say this, since I haven't read either
    of them.  It's more of an exhortation to you, gentle CM readers, so learned and
    so talented, to use your research and troves of specialized knowledge to reach
    out to a reading public that extends further than your narrow professional circle,
    further still than other, related, narrow professional circles, and take risks.
    Ask yourself why anyone would care about what you do, and if your answer is that
    they wouldn't care because they are a bunch of philistines, then you haven't thought
    the problem through enough.  You will not be praised by your colleagues for writing
    works for popular consumption.  You might even jeopardize your bid for tenure.
    \ But if you were selling books at the rate of WD, you wouldn' t need that academic
    job, now would you?"

  content: "I have an observation  related to the possibility that Dalrymple has been
    unaccepted by the poco/sa types because of his gora-ness; this was an issue brought
    up a while ago which I didn't respond to then, but now I must. Here goes: I am
    deeply disturbed by Dalrymple's own introduction of \"national\" or \"racial\"
    identity as part of the explanation for the success of his book. Here's an example,
    from his own response:\r\n\"Unless Indian historians learn to make their work
    intelligible and attractive to a wider audience, and especially to their own voraciously
    literate middle class, unhistorical myths will continue to flourish.\"\r\n\r\nThus
    I now assert, it is WD himself who maintains the color line. It is \"Indian\"
    historians who have failed to feed \"their Indian readers\" the satisfying rigorous
    and readable history. What's up with this way of talking, and why does he get
    away with that kind of generalization and racialization? \r\nLeave aside the truth
    that many historians, especially in Delhi, have written histories for \"popular
    consumption.\" Consider Romila Thapar's interventions within textbooks, the most
    recent illustrated history of India 2 volume set which I cannot remember the name
    of, and Sunil Kumar's study of sites of public history, such as the monuments
    of Delhi, in his \"The Present in Delhi's Pasts\" published by \"three-essays,\"
    itself a publication meant to reach a wider audience. (I highly recommend their
    books.)\r\n\r\nI think we need to consider seriously WD's politics of identity,
    not as they occur in his study of 1857 itself, but in the way he speaks about
    his book and how he situates his contribution to a historical subject alongside
    other's contributions.\r\nIn fact, I find WD to be a anti-intellectual intellectual.
    I would hope that if I write a book which anyone actually reads (a goal I aspire
    to), that it would make readers want to read other books and become more interested
    in other History books, and not less interested. So instead of dismissing other
    History books for the promotion of my own, I would channel the readers curiousity,
    rather than assuming to have satisfied it with my own book by dismissing others.
    This, I don't believe, is what WD does. Perhaps I am mistaken, do correct me if
    so.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the difference between professional history writing and
    popular history writing is hardly black and white (no racial pun intended). There
    are all sorts of popular histories besides books, there are monuments, tv shows,
    little historical assumptions made here and there in conversations, and  national
    or religious performances/spectacles on major publicly endorsed holidays which
    support particular versions of history. Both guild (by which I mean the conceited
    academic history profession) historians and popular historians find themselves
    running back and forth  between all those realms very often, such that the lines
    between are practically  non existent. There is no history that can be contained
    to the academy, its virtually impossible. Sure, perhaps only academics read books
    published by university presses, but this isn't the end of the readership. And
    sure, perhaps there are those who believe the Taj Mahal is actually Shiv's abode
    (though I won't dare to generalize they are Delhi's middle classes), but academic
    historians do not and cannot ignore \"the popular.\" Just a glance at the rise
    in publications from the academy having to do with the vexed issue of \"temple
    destruction\" in the past decade will support this claim.\r\n\r\nFinally, the
    sales WD's book enjoys are fabulous, and it is undoubtedly true that the issue
    of 1857 has been left little treated. However, who are the \"Indians\" Dalrymple
    is referring to in his many comments about his own book, and which of his values
    would he have to get rid of in order to stop saying things like that? And once
    that changed....who knows where that would lead Mr. WD theoretically? Cuz everyone
    has a theory, some are just more explicit than others about it."

  content: "Lapata: aside: what about the reality that some subjects are inherently
    more popular than others in terms of a lay public, and thus are likely to sell
    more regardless?  Should important work on (e.g.) Mughal land revenue system be
    shunted aside in favor of work on (e.g.) this or that battle or war.  I hear you
    on accessible history-writing, but where do we stop?  An insistence on accessibility
    can end up not only as an insistence on a certain writing style, but an insistence
    on a certain sort of SUBJECT too.  And this lay reader doesn't want to go back
    to the \"Great Men/Wars/Battles\" school of historiography.  Your comment on Dirks
    illustrates precisely my concern about where this sort of thing can lead to: \"Even
    if Nick Dirks writes clearly, he most certainly does not write entertaining popular
    histories that will be bought up by the truckload by the reading public. \"\r\n\r\ni.e.,
    even if Dirks writes clearly, his subject -- taking Castes of Mind as an example
    -- namely the impact of colonialism on caste (read, caste identities often taken
    as \"given\" in popular writing on the subject) is unlikely to be very popular.
    \ Assuming for the sake of argument Dirks passes the \"writes well\" test, what
    is to be done here?  Should he NOT write on these subjects in favor of stuff that
    might sell better (the Nehru-Edwina affair, anyone?)  There is a place for both,
    and for recognizing that a lot of history subjects just aren't grist for the bestseller
    mill -- most people are not very interested in the Meos of Mewat, but that doesn't
    mean that Shail Mayaram's work on them is obscure, surely.  (I might add that
    Dirks' latest, The Scandal of Empire, is a subject as popular as they come in
    this field, perhaps a sign that some in academia are trying to reach out to a
    wider audience).  Extended to other fields of human endeavor, one would have to
    say that Rushdie \"ought\" to try to be more like Dan Brown, and that if only
    a few thousand people read him what's the point?  I don't think anyone should
    be snooty about John Grisham or Dan Brown, but let's not be reverse-snooty: if
    popular accessibility is the only bar, I am afraid we will find that depends on
    which way we cut it: Dalrymple is \"accessible\" relative to Judith Butler, but
    he is not so accessible relative to the film Mangal Pandey -- should we privilege
    the latter, or should we appreciate that each has its place, its voice, its audience?"

  content: 'SC: interesting comment, there''s much food for thought there.  Btw, by
    2 volume popular history are you referring to Irfan Habib''s "People''s History
    of India", which is a popular work and written for a younger audience to boot?  And
    your point about academes engaging with popular myths/beliefs is well-taken: just
    think about the catalogue of "professional" historians who have engaged in public
    debates and popular writing on the Ayodhya issue, and more broadly on temple destruction
    in medieval India (e.g. Richard Eaton, writing articles in newsmagazines like
    Outlook left right and center).'

  content: "From some of Lapata's and sepoy's comments (apologies in advance if I
    have misunderstood either of you) it seems to me that you two are taking the position
    that Dalrymple is being critiqued BECAUSE he is a \"popular historian\" -- that
    might be true chez certain grad students etc. (as lapata notes), but I haven't
    seen any of that on this thread.  Some of us critique him on other grounds.\r\n\r\nbtw,
    on that blogger Dalrymple has quoted: it smacks of bad faith to cite Spivak and
    Bhabha as examples of \"bad scholarship\" relative to the \"good\" Dalrymple:
    \ I mean for pete's sake, Spivak is not and has never pretended to be a \"pure
    historian\".  She is a theoretician, and if the question is, does theory X apply
    to (e.g.) 1857, that isn't something she is doing at all!  The \"opposition\"
    if there must be one, is not between historians like Dalrymple and \"pure\" theorists
    like Spivak, but between the former and other historians (Irfan Habib, Dirks,
    etc. etc.)."

  content: Qalandar - perhaps Habib's set is the one I am thinking of, thanks for
    that. I also meant to note that 1857 is a good topic for public consumption because
    there is much readiness for it; all those who think of it as anything like the
    "first war of independence" to "islamic polity revivalism under Zafar" to "the
    failed attempt at subverting company rule" will all find a book on 1857 appealing,
    and will buy the book. Chatterjee's Princely Impostor, while much more beautifully
    written than WD's in my opinion, can't get so many takers, especially not by those
    who are unfamiliar with the Bhawal-Sannyasi case; but this doesn't make Chatterjee
    an isolationist professional.

  content: "Qualander, great points. The NCERT (surprise surprise) has finally introduced
    a rather well written engaging series of history textbooks which deal with questions
    like Nationalism and Cricket and introduces themes of cultural and social history.
    (http://ncert.nic.in/textbooks/testing/Index.htm)\r\n\r\nWD naturally misses out
    on are popular histories in vernacular languages. Both Malyalam and Bengali have
    a rich tradition in the same.Balakrihsna Pillai's work on the history of Kerala
    (linking the narratives to Rome and Babylon through maritime trade) are fascinating.
    In Bengali, the historical novel made people familiar with the Indigo revolt (Satyen
    Sen) and the Battle of Plassey. and the revolt (Sunil Gangopadhaya). While few
    of these writers have degrees in history (they did have honoris causas like WD
    though), they do engage with sources and produce a better history than the Amar
    Chitra Katha versions.\r\n\r\nAlso similiar to TLM, but not as talked about, are
    Abraham Eraly's works on the Mughals. (The Last Spring, Emperor's of the Peacock

  content: "Red: as someone who himself is deprived of access to the wealth of material
    in Indian languages, I feel the loss keenly I must say.  Glad you brought up Eraly
    (I think he's also written a book on ancient India that I haven't read yet): I
    did read Eraly's work on the Mughals last year when I was in India, and although
    he seems to rely almost exclusively on court/official histories and European traveller
    accounts, he is a very engaging writer indeed, and has a novelist's gift for memorably
    etching characters -- and it's great to see him do this vis-a-vis personages who
    aren't household names: such as Prince Akbar (Aurangzeb's son), his sister Zeb-un-Nissa,
    Mir Jumla, etc.  I don't know how much his work has sold, but I saw it in many
    many bookshops in Delhi last year, so hopefully it's doing well...(though he does
    have this \"angle\" of holding the Mughals and the Maratthas \"responsible\" for
    not doing more to \"make India ready\" for the challenge of Western imperialism).\r\n\r\nAnother
    book (sadly in need of a good editor) that was written by a non-professional historian,
    relies very much on \"vernacular\" sources, and was written for a popular audience
    in recent years, is G.S. Cheema's The Forgotten Mughals (1707-1857), which also
    (speaking of 1857) does a very good job of vividly describing the carnage unleashed
    in Delhi after the British retook the city, and also did a wonderful job describing
    the 1739 sack of the city by Nadir Shah.  The writing style is very accessible
    (but somewhat clunky) but I do recommend it as there isn't much that is written
    on this subject..."

    is however quite true that the jihadi element in 1857 was something that I did

    a relevance to people who might have no idea who the Mughals are in the first
    place. I don't think this is illegitimate, as long as the jihadi
    element is kept in proportion.\"\r\n\r\nI find it hard to imagine an American
    who has no idea at all who the Mughals were. Likewise, I dare not imagine what
    comes to an 'average' American's mind when he/she sees/hears the word 'jihadi'.
    Except perhaps a highly insidious sense of 'continuity', of the 'permanence' of
    jihadis among Muslims. It may be a good strategy for the book's promotion&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as
    readily and unabashedly acknowledged by Mr Dalrymple--but may also make life somewhat
    harder for a few of us who are paranoid enough already. That's why I was glad
    to read that inane review of the book in the NYTimes. It was so stupidly written
    that it failed to take up even the promotional bait, and thus make the book and
    the review timely for America and help in its sales. \r\nLet me, however, hasten
    to add that except for the above paragraph, I found nothing to kvetch about in
    WD's long response. It's a fine book, and it will last long after he stops promoting

    problematic but lack sufficient insight to determine whether the problem is WD-specific."

  content: 'Ajnabi: c''mon yaar, yes it is microbe-sized but surely there''s no way
    TLM makes the bestseller list right?  I mean if CMN had been referring to the
    population in its entirety, then I would consider him naive (not just with respect
    to the US but any country).  Consider: WD writes that his book has sold 40,000
    copies in 5 months in India -- but India has 50-100 million people who can read
    English.  Even if we arbitrarily slash that number by four-fifths , the % is still
    tiny, as it always is.  Now consider a book on another country''s history (one
    not seen to be directly implicated in one''s "own" history), and I am sure those
    sales go down, way down (i.e. I imagine a biography of Queen Victoria would do
    better in India than one of Bismarck).  Now in the US (but NOT in the UK), surely
    Indian history has fewer "consumers" than (obviously) say, of a biography of John
    Adams, or even of British history?'

  content: "For the sake of some evidence, here's a link to an interview of WD done
    in Bombay at some point, and some excerpts below. Granted, the questions he is
    being asked suck cuz they mark him as an \"outsider\" but his answers maintain
    that distinction, and they operate on generalizations about \"Indians\" and \"British\".
    Thus, let me clarify that I am not accusing WD of racism, I hardly think that
    is the case. However, I do think he has a \"politics of identity\" which relies
    on generalizations and the maintenance of difference between one group of people
    and another. So in most circumstances, he himself introduces his \"goraness\"
    into the conversation (though not in this interview). And my extrapolation is
    that Said's text doesn't sit well with him for some such reason. (I wholeheartedly
    believe there are many things wrong with Said's book, but I don't think WD has
    identified those things. In fact, at that conference, at which WD was promoting
    his book White Mughals, he went on to say that it is clear there was no identity
    politics involved such as what Said outlines, because as you can see, my book
    illustrates the intimate relations created between EIC and natives...it was something
    like this. Perhaps WD can come back on and clarify for himself.\r\nHere's the
    link:\r\nhttp://mid-day.com/smd/go/2002/august/28654.htm\r\n\r\nExcerpts:\r\nQ:What
    are the craziest queries fellow Brits have asked you about India, such as do Indians
    get to work on an elephant&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\n\r\nWD: \"In general, middle-class
    Brits know about India. It is a strange paradox: desis have an innate and well-founded
    suspicions of the Angrez, while the Angrez have a deep and passionate love of
    India.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to another question,\r\nWD: \"While Indian writers
    have virtually conquered the Indian market, they are so far less sophisticated
    in non-fiction. You have very fine journalists, but no great Indian biographers.
    I am very lucky to survive because it is quite a thing to come to a country and
    write their history.\"\r\n\r\nTo all this I merely have to extend my deepest gratitude
    to WD, thank you so much for freeing my family from the realm of mythical history
    into pure empiricism. Got anything else my folks at home might need?"

  content: That was also I thought the strongest point Gyan Prakash made, that Dalrymple
    seems to take at face value "intimate connections" such as this or that Resident
    or other Englishman "going native", keeping harems and the like.  And in fact
    that's what led us, on the other thread, to the whole "subalternist" discussion,
    because to take this sort of thing at face value means that one is simply discarding
    a whole discourse and scholarship that depends on NOT taking this sort of thing
    at face value (at that point the issue of the extent to which x or y school deserves
    to be ignored, because it is exclusionary/obscurantist/whatever took over the
    debate).  I maintain that a historiography, whether or not popular, cannot just
    ignore important strands of scholarship without raising question marks about its
    credibility.

  content: Qalandar - I agree. Thus when WD claims he gives up theory for empiricism,
    I can't help but wonder what he means by that exactly. "Pure empiricism" does
    not produce better truths, as all readings of sources and evidence are laden with
    theoretically discussable methods (a discussion WD doesn't want to participate
    in). Thus to champion empiricism in place of theory seems to create a dichotomy
    which is not maintainable.... And now on to WD's historical work itself (cuz yes,
    he's a historian popular or otherwise). Both in White Mughals and in TLM Dalrymple
    approaches positivism in his reading of the sources. Thus even as he qualifies
    his use of the word "jihad" as an explanatory factor for 1857, he maintains its
    connection with current notions of jihad, something Sepoy was right on to flag.
    His basic argument in TLM is that all the "schools of professional history writing"
    have failed to note the overwhelming religious nature of 1857, which TLM now offers.
    Even here, I disagree with WD...though the reasons would be too long to write.
    Here's where we fall into his trap if we dismiss poco/subaltern st. because WD
    does so, while there are numerous things wrong with those schools, again I don't
    think WD has articulated them. He has just made it easier for many people to dismiss
    their interventions, thus I call him an anti-intellectual intellectual. In any
    case email me off list so that we can converse off the blogosphere. -Sheetal (sc2513atcolumbia.edu)

    falling prey to the notion of Islam as always already preordained towards militant

    WD's Age of Kali made me very very uncomfortable. While witty and acerbic( the
    Benazir  and Shobha De interviews had me in splits), his articles profiled the
    most exotic images of India. He discussion of Rup Kanwar's sati (20 years after
    it took place), Indian royalty, caste violence, erotic temple carvings, Bollywood,
    widows in Vrindavan, nostaligia about Portugese rule basically cover every single

    why British men keeping Indian mistresses and \"wives\" and going native, necessarily
    speaks of a begign or more fluid form of colonialism. Do relations with Southern
    plantaiton owners with Black slave women suggest a more begign form of slavery?
    There was no question of British women associating with Indian men in any way,
    even back in the early 19th century. In some ways, his \"intimate connections\"
    bears an uncomfortable resemblance to accounts of ICS officers in the 19th and

    from the pale.  And I guess to continue playing devil's advocate, books like the
    White Mughals seek to highlight situations precisely where the women in question
    HAD choices (unlike the slave plantation women) -- i.e. these were generally \"well-born\"
    women who in many/most cases had to ruffle quite a few feathers to marry/cohabit
    with the Englishman in question.  [WD arguably remains open to critique for focusing
    on the marginal phenomenon to make a general point, given that he doesn't really
    address situations which would be more analogous to your slave plantation example.]
    \ \r\n\r\nThe irony is that to the extent WD comes down harshly against the \"racist
    Raj\" in \"favor\" of a more ambiguous predecessor, and uses narratives of overlooked/\"marginal\"
    liaisons (in the White Mughals) to make his point, he owes more to the post-structuralists,
    the subalternists, and the Foucauldians than he perhaps realizes..."

    in many ways, the art of great narrative historiography written by Indians is

    One of the greatest storytelling nations has stopped producing stories about its
    own past, forgetting that ideological battles over history can never be a substitute
    for enticing narratives. William Dalrymple's masterly The Last
    Mughal subtly undercuts the significance of this event for Indians: its wonderful
    recovery of a time when nation state ideologies had not congealed our identities,
    also glosses over the hierarchies colonialism produced. 1857 has the power to
    move because, it is, above all else a darn good story. Too bad, there is simply
    no contemporary Indian narrative of the event of any power.\r\nBut historical
    amnesia and indifference to the cause of liberty and self rule pose real dangers
    to a nation that has forgotten how to write its own history. If the indifference

  content: et.al Dalrymple's defence of his book by citing that 40000 hard-back copies
    were sold in India, he would do well to find, how-many were bought by individuals,
    and how many copies were read from page 1 to last page. Did Dalrymple not mention
    that Prof. Irfan Habib had not read his book and he ( Dalrymple) had sent him
    a copy. If Prof.Irfan Habib had not read Dalrymple's book ( as claimed by Dalrymple)
    it goes to prove that Dalrymple has not written History but a Roman(Novel).Obviously
    Novelists do play around with facts, as Dalrymple has done by  dubbing genuine
    uprising of all Bashindas of Hindustan against John Company, as a fundamentalist
    Jihad. Nothing can be farther from truth. What Dalrymple wrote is a novel not
    history. Western Universities might have given him Honoris causa D.Litts for history,
    but these are as bizarre as Nobel Committee givng Nobel peace prize to U.S. president
    when the Nobel nomination closure date preceded the inauguration of the President
    of U.S. So much for Western sense of probity and justice. 1857 was a response
    to rapacity, intolerance, amoral actions, and attack on religious beliefs of native
    Indians by John Company. Dalrymple claims to have based his book on research conducted
    on 1857 documents available in Indian archives. Tarry a little, Dalrymple is not
    proficient either in Urdu or Persian. So he depended on translators paid for by
    him. The cue is obvious. Dalrymple is advised to go through "1857 India'a war
    for Independence" by V.D.Savarkar. Savarkar went through original records of East
    India Company and British Government available in India House London during 1905
    to 1907. The book was banned and was one of the charges framed against Savarkar
    when he was awarded 50 years transportation for life by the British Judges. Dalrymple
    must read Delhi portion of this book. Incidentally the tallest leader, that emerges
    out of 1857, is Maulvi Ahmed Ali of Fyzabad, who by no stretch of imagination
    can be dubbed as a Jihadist. Coming from Savarkar, who is dubbed as rabid Hindu
    fundamentalist by India's secular establishment and academics, it would be a revelation
    to Dalrymple and his ilk.

<p>A response by William Dalrymple</p>
<div id="blockquoted">Manan just looked through the <a href="/archives/optical_character_recognition/dalrymples_last_mughal.html#comments">amazingly long discussion</a> your review provoked- very flattering to see people engaging with the book. A few small points, and please feel free to post any of this that you want to:</p>
<p>1. Re your comment:<br />
There is plenty to call Dalrymple on -<br />
1. The selling of 1857 in the media as an &ldquo;Jihad&rdquo;.
</p></div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<div id="blockquoted">
I have NEVER characterised the 1857 uprising as a Jihad. What I have done, and make no apology for doing, is to emphasise the jihadi substratum of the revolt in Delhi which seemed to me to have been somewhat brushed under the carpet by the nationalist historians. About 100,000 sepoys marched to Delhi in 1857; about 25,000 self-described jihadis/Ghazis/Mujahedin also turned up; it seems that both need to be explained and commented on and I have attempted to cover both. I have also emphasised the religious rhetoric of the revolt which unambiguously dominates the proclamations of the rebels in Delhi, both sepoys and jihadis, as well as the texts produced at the time by the local commentators such as Maulvi Mohammad Baqar- see <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/04/biblio-1857-article-as-printed.pdf' title='biblio-1857-article-as-printed.pdf'>the attached article</a> in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.biblio-india.com">Biblio</a> which may clarify this [pdf].</p>
<p> It is however quite true that the jihadi element in 1857 was something that I did consciously emphasise while promoting the book in the US ,as it gives the book a relevance to people who might have no idea who the Mughals are in the first place. I don't think this is illegitimate, as long as the jihadi element is kept in proportion.</p>
<p>2. As I have attempted to tell the human story of Delhi before during and after 1857, there was little opportunity to engage with Subaltern work, given that no subaltern has written on this topic. The one Subaltern essay I have seen about 1857, Gautam Bhadra' s, I liked very much, as someone pointed out in the blog. As I have made clear in all my interviews, I believe there are many ways to write history. The pomo/poco crowd and the subalterns don't in general particularly light my fire, and its true I find their obscurantist mangling of the English language irritating, and that I prefer empirical research to theory, but if thats what they are into, fine. I have certainly never written about them with 'bile'.</p>
<p>I am simply writing in a quite different historiographical tradition and happen to admire Simon Schama, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Steven Runciman's way of writing and presenting history, recreating real human lives from the past in good accessable prose. I do think there need be no contradiction between researching professionally and exhaustively, and then  writing up what you find in good, clear and attractive English. If you write only for other professional historians, and in a form of dense academese that almost deliberately excludes the general reader, you become like mediaeval churchmen cloaking their obscurantism in mediaeval Latin. </p>
<p>I firmly believe that if you do not feed intelligent accurate history to a general middle class audience, historical mythology will take its place- as one can see whenever you attend a Middle Class party in Delhi and here the nonsense people spout about the Mughals and how the Taj Mahal is a Shiva temple etc etc. As I wrote in an NYRB essay last year:</p>
<p>"Exacerbating the problem in the long term is the absence of genuinely accessible, well-written and balanced histories of India... This as much as anything else has allowed myths to replace history among India's middle class, who are keen consumers of fiction, but have surprisingly little home-grown non-fiction to interest them: one of the remarkable features of the recent spectacular burst of creativity among Indian writers has been the absence of much serious biography or narrative history. Though Indian historians produce many excellent specialist essays  and numerous learned journals, and it is impossible, for example, to buy an up-to-date and accessible biography of any of India's pre-Colonial rulers.</p>
<p>Here perhaps lies one of the central causes of the current impasse. It is not just up to the politicians. Unless Indian historians learn to make their work intelligible and attractive to a wider audience, and especially to their own voraciously literate middle class, unhistorical myths will continue to flourish.</p>
<p>I don' t think I am alone in feeling this. Here was a comment by one recent blogger about the book:</p>
<p>"I enjoyed greatly his little dig at the Subaltern Studies school and their tendency to cloak a lack of genuine research by etymological obfuscation and a continual use of abstract terminology. As Dalrymple demonstrates, the subaltern voice can be recovered, but it involves moving your fat arse off the seat of your luxurious office provided by your well-paid American university post, and searching through dusty archives in India. One piece of genuine history is worth a thousand pieces of theorising introspection from the field of post-colonial studies. It is a great irony that characters like Spivak and Bhabha enshrine the imputed qualities of self-serving over-clever deviousness that led the colonisers to hold the "Educated Baboo" in contempt".</p>
<p>Incidentally, the fact that the Last Mughal has sold coming on for 40,000 hardback in India in under five months shows the massive and currently unsatisfied appetite that exists for well-written but serious history. Compare the number of scholarly but accessable and well written histories and biographies on American history that exist in any Borders, with the almost complete absence of anything comparable in Indian bookshops.</p>
<p>3. While I am not an academic, I am a little bemused by the idea of being a pariah in academe, given that I have  received two D Litts, Honoris Causa, in the last year and spent much of the last six months doing little else but give seminars in universities. I attach the reviews the book has received and you will see that the book has had an amazingly generous reception from both academics and non-academic reveiwers. To date the book has not recieved a single outrighty hostile review, and only a couple of mixed ones.</p>
<p>Moreover both my history books have won major history prizes- I am esp proud of the Wolfson Prize for History which is arguable Britain's  grandest history award. Previous winners include Simon Schama, Keith Thomas, Steven Runciman, Owen Chadwick, Christopher Bayly, Norman Stone, Richard Cobb,  Orlando Figes, Roy Porter, John Bossy, Lords Skidelski and Bullock and Linda Colley: a pretty comprehensive list of Britain's most celebrated professional historians. It is really as high an honour as a British historian could ask for.</p>
<p>[In case its of interest here is the full list  http://www.wolfson.org.uk/pdf/previouswinners.pdf<br />
The judges are Sir Keith Thomas FBA (Chairman), Professor Averil Cameron CBE FBA, Professor Richard Evans FBA and Professor David Cannadine FBA.]  </p>
<p>  4. I never claimed the Mutiny Papers were "utterly unknown"- what I say was "virtually unused"- which is true: around 75% of the papers Mahmood and I called up had never been accessed before, and has no accession stamps on the files. Irfan Habib had not seen the book when he wrote the piece in Outlook. Since then he has done so and liked it. He has recommended it in his writings, invited me to speak at Aligarh and asked me to contribute to a book the Aligrah lot are putting together about 1857. Here was my reponse in Outlook to his essay.</p>
<p>"As a huge admirer of Professor Habib's work- which is cited frequently throughout the Last Mughal- I am profoundly flattered that India's greatest Mughal scholar has seen fit to comment so thoughtfully and at such length on my book. I am however a little surprised that a man famous for his scrupulous use of primary sources has done so without first looking at the text in question. Had he read even the introduction, he would have found that I have not said, written or implied, any of the following statements which he seems to attribute to me.</p>
<p>1. That Indian historians are either 'lazy' or 'lethargic'.<br />
2. That I am the first person to write the history of 1857 from Urdu and Persian sources.<br />
3. That the Mutiny Papers in the National Archives are uncatalogued.<br />
4. That I discovered the collection.<br />
5. That to use British sources is &ldquo;a sin to be avoided&rdquo;.<br />
6. That I compare Muslim sepoys to jihadis.</p>
<p>What I have said is that I am a little surprised that a collection as astonishingly rich and as beautifully catalogued as the Mutiny Papers, and one located so centrally in the National Archives of the capital city, within sight of Rashtrapati Bhavan, have been so little consulted. After all, the contents- some 20,000 Urdu and Persian documents- describe in fabulous detail what happened in Delhi- the destination of around 100,000 of the total 139,000 rebel sepoys. It is a collection which uniquely preserves the actions and thoughts of the courtiers, the soldiers of the different sepoy regiments, and both the elite and the ordinary people of Delhi throughout the largest upheaval to rock Hindustan in the course of the entire nineteenth century.</p>
<p>As I acknowledge in the book, several specialist papers and a full length biography of Zafar in Urdu, have previously been written from the contents of the collection. But of the documents studied by myself and my colleague Mahmood Farooqui over four years of intensive research, fully 75% had never before been requisioned, as was clear both from the absence of any previous stamps or requisition details on the files in question (the archives list on each file the dates and names of everyone who calls them up), and from the comments of the archivists. As the staff of the archives confirmed to me this weekend, over the last two decades several scholars have found the catalogue (which was printed in 1921 and is available in libraries worldwide- my own copy was borrowed from the London Library in St James Square, so is surely also available in that of Prof Habib's AMU) and called up some of the papers, but most have given up after seeing the difficulty of the shikastah in which the documents are written. For cracking this, I have the skills and amazing perseverance of Mahmood to thank.</p>
<p>As for Professor Habib's charge that I make an &ldquo;unfortunate assumption&rdquo; that the Muslim sepoys were precursors to the jihadis of today, this is also quite incorrect. The precursors of the jihadis of today were the self-described jihadis of 1857, who were quite separate from the sepoys, and who gathered in some numbers in Delhi from centres such as Tonk, Patna and Gwalior. These ordinary Muslim civilians whose own petitions to Zafar in the Mutiny Papers describe themselves as jihadis, mujahedin and ghazis, had taken up arms to fight for their faith against the aggressive intrusions of the Christian West, whose representatives they invariably describe using religious language as kafir (infidels) and nasrani (Christians) rather than in more secular terms as Angrez, Firangis or goras.</p>
<p>As I describe at some length in my book, during the 'Id of 1857, these jihadis seriously threatened the intercommunal harmony successfully maintained by both the court and the sepoys, when they announced they wished to slaughter a cow on the steps of the Jama Masjid, something Zafar eventually dissuaded them from doing.  Indeed it is the way Zafar continually fights for Hindu-Muslim unity in the face of the extremists, and his insistence on holding the jihadi spirit at bay,  that forms the basis of my admiration both for him and the composite culture he represents.</p>
<p> I have sent Professor Habib a copy of my book, and if he ever finds the time to read it, and gets from it even a fraction of the enjoyment that I have received from his remarkable body of work, I will be more than satisfied."
