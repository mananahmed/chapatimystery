    how i discovered your blog actually and now i'm a fan! I just finished a class
    on the cold war today.. it was sad, and my professor hardly mentioned Pakistan,
    Afghanistan and India so i didn't really learn what happened to these countries
    during the cold war.

    its conversion to a counter-insurgency force is needed to achieve stability there.
    \ A discredited elite scared of revolution will be only too happy to oblige.  Eventual

    problem, anti-americanism is really high, and the fight against the Taliban is
    seen largely as \"america's war\".  But I think now people are realizing that
    the Taliban are a major threat to the way of life most Pakistanis want to lead."

  content: "Maybe the kerfuffle in the press has to do with western skepticism of
    Pakistani democracy. What the author does not address is that over the past eight
    years, the Pakistani state has steadily yielded ground to the Taliban.   It failed
    to support the maliks who were the pillars of its rule in FATA.  The Pakistani
    Army has time and again fought the Taliban, achieved no results, sued for peace,
    retreated, and repeated the cycle.   The major part of NWFP is effectively under
    Taliban control.   The Pakistani press (e.g., Dawn, Jang) has time and again
    pointed out the muddled thinking that prevails, that the US wants to draw Pakistan
    into its fight with the Taliban and so is funding the Taliban; or that India,
    for similar reasons, is doing so.  The youtubes of Pakistani notables making these
    arguments on Pakistani television are also there to view. This cognitive dissonance
    can only come from an unwillingness to fight. (So deep does this go that the logical
    argument, if the Taliban are funded by the enemy, India, then the Taliban should
    be fought as an instrument of India, is never made.)  When the British ruled
    India, they were constantly engaged in the evaluation of if and when their half-million-man
    army would stop fighting on their behalf.  The size of the army is irrelevant,
    as they realized. It is the willingness to fight; and British rule over India
    ended when the evaluation was that the army would not be reliable any more.  It
    is thus equally legitimate to wonder about the willingness of the Pakistani army
    to fight - its half-million men in uniform is irrelevant - and the end of the
    Pakistani state begins when this army is no longer reliable.  What I wrote
    doesn't mean that Manan Ahmed is necessarily wrong about the possibility of a
    Pakistani collapse;  it simply means that he has utterly not addressed the issue.
    \ The issue of whether the West doesn't want to support democracy in Pakistan
    is  a sideshow, a distraction."

  content: I should further add that when British rule in India collapsed, at least
    their heirs in whose hands they left the country were committed to some form or
    other of secularism and of democracy. I don't want to argue about their competency
    to achieve such goals, but at least their philosophy was forward looking.  In
    the case of the Pakistani state, however, the heir apparent is medieval.

  content: "<i>What I wrote doesn't mean that Manan Ahmed is necessarily
    wrong about the possibility of a Pakistani collapse; it simply means that he has
    utterly not addressed the issue.</i>  Actually Sepoy does do this quite
    clearly in the article. You can agree or disagree with his reasons for dismissing
    the 'failed state' arguement but it is incorrect to claim he does not address
    it.     <i>I should further add that when British rule in India
    collapsed, at least their heirs in whose hands they left the country were committed
    to some form or other of secularism and of democracy.</i>   The democracy
    bit is true; the secularism bit needs some qualification. It was only a very small
    section of the Congress that was committed to secularism; notably Nehru and the
    CSP. Gandhi's assasination and the early death of Patel hobbled those forces that
    were less favourably inclined towards secularism in India but it is worth noting
    that Ambedkar resigned in disgust at the resistance of his social reforms to the
    legal code from Parliament and Nehru had to threaten to resign several times before
    some parts of the constitution, such as the ban on cow slaughter, were excluded.
    Secularism as an ideology has only been the preserve of a relatively narrow band
    of elite opinion for large parts of post-colonial history; the fact that these
    sections commanded considerable political clout rested on factors other than their
    secular inclinations and policies and once this influence started to decline;
    we saw the re-emergence of religious nationalism."

  content: "With global warming looming I have turned into a Luddite myself, but I
    do feel like coming to the defense of all of those medievalists out there.  If
    by 'medieval inheritors' you meant the Taliban
    then I can just see the 'moorish' Andalusians
    feeling quite insulted by being lumped with the likes of Sufi Mohammad.  The Taliban
    are nothing if not tribal Pashtuns in cultural/social outlook and I do not see
    much evidence of tribal Pashtuns having run Pakistan in the last half century.
    \ If by 'medieval inheritors' you meant
    Punjabi/Sindhi landlords — i.e. 'feudals',
    then this used to be quite fashionable thinking in Pakistan a while ago but I
    personally find it hard to relate 12th century Europeans with the present day
    Pakistani elite and historians these days tend to shy clear of the spatio-temporal
    contradictions such a juxtaposition creates. In my humble opinion, a bit more
    specificity than the 'medieval' label would
    be more helpful for the discussion."

  content: I enjoyed your interview on Democracy Now -- it was very informative. But
    I would quibble with your idea that the Zardari government needs support in its
    military campaign in the Swat region and elsewhere. Methinks Obama and Gilani
    toy too lightly with the tens or hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in
    the crossfire. Couldn't the Pakistani people be given the chance to throw off
    the Taliban just the way they threw off Musharraf? It seems to me a peaceful strategy
    of political resistance to the Taliban would be cheaper, more effective, and more
    humane to the local people. I fear this attack on Swat by the army will compound
    the human and political damage done by US drones.

  content: "Arun wrote \"Maybe the kerfuffle in the press has to do with western
    skepticism of Pakistani democracy.&rdquo;  That is true.&rdquo;
    West\"(both governments and their cheer leaders in press) loved 11 years of Ayub
    Khan(Military  dictator, agenda;enlightened moderation), \"West\" loved 11 years
    of Zia Ul Haq ( Fundamentalist Military dictator,1977-1988,  decade of Islamisation,Afghan
    Jihad, Heroine, Kalashnikov and hypocrisy),West again was spellbound by  8 plus
    years of Musharraf (Dictator, enlightened modernization, second Afghan war) and
    in between not a single elected government  completed the tenure to see the next
    election. So the western skepticism of Pakistani democracy is beyond any doubt.  \"What
    the author does not address is that over the past eight years, the Pakistani state
    has steadily yielded ground to the Taliban.\"  So from Pakistan democracy
    (bad) we jump to Pakistan state. Well there you have it. There was no democracy
    in Pakistan from Oct 1999 to Feb 2008. After Feb. 2008 we have democracy where
    our armed forces still take direct directions from &ldquo;West&rdquo;
    read USA. So apparently it was not democracy's fault.  \"The
    Pakistani Army has time and again fought the Taliban, achieved no results, sued
    for peace, retreated, and repeated the cycle.\"  From Pakistan state (bad)
    onto Army, now we are getting somewhere. So the questions that beg answers
    are 1) who &ldquo;failed to support the maliks who were the pillars
    of its rule in FATA.&rdquo; In fact who destroyed the very tribal governance
    arrangements in place since 1947? Flip side question would be who stopped Pakistan
    military from decisive victory against Taliban?  \"The Pakistani press (e.g.,
    Dawn, Jang) has time and again pointed out the muddled thinking that prevails,
    that the US wants to draw Pakistan into its fight with the Taliban and so is funding
    the Taliban; or that India, for similar reasons, is doing so.\"  From army
    to Pakistan press, well it is illogical! (Bad)  \"&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.of
    Pakistani notables making these arguments on Pakistani television are also there
    to view. This cognitive dissonance can only come from an unwillingness to fight.\"  From
    press to Pakistani Notables, equally bad.  \"It is thus equally legitimate
    to wonder about the willingness of the Pakistani army to fight - its half-million
    men in uniform is irrelevant - and the end of the Pakistani state begins when
    this army is no longer reliable.\"  So now we are debating willingness of
    a  army  to preserve a bad state. Analogy with British Raj army is  perfect. During
    Raj it was called Indus Army with Headquarters in ,you guessed it, Rawalpindi.
    Now  the higher command of this army serves interests of another Empire. The army
    men below the rank of Colonel have nothing to do with this imperial adventure,
    nothing to gain from killing their own brethern in NWFP/FATA/SWAT/North Punjab.
    That is the crisis of Legitimacy we should be talking about. British had to leave
    because there was no legitimate reason for them to be in subcontinent in the first
    place. No Taliban were threatening to invade London and destroy Oxford and Cambridge(because
    they hated the freedom), when east India company arrived here. Likewise current
    belligerents (read USA, Pakistan army and religious extremists) have no legitimacy
    of purpose to vast majority of people inhabiting these areas, that is why this
    dog and pony show of GWOT is generating more unease and reaction. If FAILED
    STATE means failure of the present setup, subservient to the foreign interests.
    That will be a good deal for masses.  \"In the case of the Pakistani state,
    however, the heir apparent is medieval.\"  This statement paints everybody
    from Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Sufi Muhammad with the same brush. Good luck with
    finding any takers.  Arthur Edelstein wrote \"Couldn't
    the Pakistani people be given the chance to throw off the Taliban just the way
    they threw off Musharraf?\"  That to me is real solution. Anytime when Pakistani
    public opinion is about to reach a critical mass where it could throw away the
    Feudal/Mullah/Military/Imperial yoke, there is a general in waiting. So it is
    essential to narrow  both the knowledge and empathy gap among well wishers when
    it comes to Pakistan. And I commend sepoy's efforts."

  content: "I appreciate your forwarding this link to me. Sepoy, I am extremely skeptical
    of your analysis.  First of all, on the question of the \"American media,\"
    it seems to me counter-productive to try to link the reporters of the New York
    Times and Washington Post with some imperialist conspiracy. It's a warmed over
    version of Said's argument in Covering Islam. In an age when journalists without
    western press credentials in many parts of the world have difficulty staying alive,
    what's the point of condemning the ones with \"western\" press credentials?  The
    fact of the matter is, it seems to me, that we all read the reportage coming from
    these outlets. Certainly, I don't wish the NYT or WP to withdraw their journalists
    from Islamabad, Karachi, or Lahore (they've already withdrawn from Peshawar!).
    Nor is anything I can see that particularly distinguishes the reportage of, say,
    a Carlotta Gall, Ismail Khan, Salman Masood, Mark Mazetti, Jane Perlez, Eric Schmidt,
    or Pir Zubair Shah (the NYT's roster of correspondents), from the reportage of
    any other media outlet in the world, in any language or from any region. Or, rather,
    if there is an issue, it's hardly one of west versus east, but of left versus
    right.  I have plenty of criticisms of the media, but, as Arun implies, I hardly
    think that the Pakistani media, say, is more immune from those criticisms than
    any other. I would take as an example, Ahmed Rashid. Is his point of view particularly
    distinct, in any way that categories like \"Western media\" would illuminate,
    from the perspective of anybody else (including your own)?  Is he a member of
    the western media? So what is the point of casting aspersions on the work of journalists
    writing for U.S. newspapers? As for the media of Pakistan, what about the massive
    resistance in the media to acknowledging that the Mumbai terrorists were Pakistani
    nationals? And what are the leftist, secular organs of this media? What is the
    equivalent in Pakistan to the numerous left-wing media outlets in India (and the
    U.S.)? Are we to judge the vitality of the media strictly on the basis of the
    number of channels or newspapers, or isn't some more qualitative consideration
    required to establish the claim of \"vitality\"? Name the journalist or politician
    who is not seriously embattled operating in any medium in Pakistan today who consistently
    advocates a democratic, secular, anti-landlordist, and pro-working-class politics. Quite
    frankly, your criticism of the western media seems to me like a conservative nationalist
    (not to mention, crypto-racist) argument. Never mind the fact that numerous Pakistani
    nationals routinely co-author pieces with Gall, Perlez, and Schmidt, or, indeed,
    pen pieces on their own for the NYT. As I pointed with respect to solid reporting
    of Saeed Shah in the Guardian after the Mumbai attacks, reporters in Pakistan
    face active hostility from the government (whether civilian or military) and should,
    in my view, be supported for their bravery in what is, after all, an extremely
    adverse environment. One need only mention the name of Daniel Pearl to remind
    oneself of the real dangers journalists in Pakistan face. More recently, there
    is Intermedia's 2008 Annual State of Media in Pakistan Report, summarized by Irfan
    Bukhari in the Nation, of 15 journalists killed and numerous others injured and
    intimidated in Pakistan in the last year.  As for the size of Pakistan's cities
    or army, again following Arun's point, what difference does this really make?
    We know that many in the Pakistani army are sympathetic (to say nothing more of
    it) to the (Af-Pak) Taliban. This is far more the case than was true of the Iranian
    army in 1979 (a much more powerful and disciplined force than anything Pakistan
    has today).  The idea that the Taliban threat is overblown by \"hysterical\"
    and \"hyperventilating\" western commentators is, in my view, motivated by a dangerous
    \ refusal to recognize the clear and present danger to all our Pakistani (political
    and personal) friends.  For as was the case in Iran (and, to a large extent, as
    was the case during the Bangladesh War and the Zia years), our political friends
    will not live to tell the tale of the Taliban's takeover of Pakistan and we will
    be left to \"hyperventilate\" in our mourning for them. In the end, of course,
    the U.S. government and military don't give a damn about the democratic aspirations
    of the people of Pakistan. Nor does the Pakistani political elite and your much
    ballyhooed middle class. 60 years of betrayal of those aspirations by the U.S.
    acting hand-in-glove with the Pakistani elite and middle-class demonstrate this
    proposition beyond any serious doubt.  This does not mean that there aren't good
    people working for the U.S. Government and military or that it is a sin to be
    elite or middle-class from Pakistan (or any other country). But as far as any
    class analysis of the forces of democracy in Pakistan is concerned, I would be
    chary or over-hyping the Lawyers' Movement. In the end, unlike in Iraq, which
    has real geo-political significance, the U.S. military's will to fight the Taliban
    in Afghanistan and Pakistan is weak. What really does the U.S. have to lose in
    Afghanistan and Pakistan? Very arguably, not much. And will the Pakistani army
    step up to the plate to fight the Taliban in the (admitedly unlikely event) that
    the U.S. were to withdraw? As for the dynamics of Talibanization, as we can already
    see in the regions of Pakistan that have already fallen to the Taliban, the army
    acquiesces and the population is not consulted no matter how large the population.
    Why do think the scenario would be any different if it were to be on a larger
    scale? It is simply naive to act as if the wishes of the population of Karachi
    or Lahore was particularly relevant. The issue is political. What are the political
    forces in those cities that can actually prosecute the war on the Taliban, advance
    a progressive political economic agenda, reduce the power of the military, and
    democratize the institutions of Pakistan? More importantly, how does your analysis
    help any such incipient elements to orient itself strategically and tactically?
     As for your suggestion that Pakistani democracy is now strong, I think you
    are falling prey to the gross self-delusion. How could it possibly be the case
    that Pakistan is witnessing a major mass-based democratization even as its government
    cedes territories over which it claims sovereignty to the worst sort of reactionary
    elements? Is there any historical precedent for such a paradox? You point to the
    Lawyers' Movement. If that movement were so progressive and had such deep roots
    in Pakistani society and was in fact spear-heading a democratic movement in Pakistan,
    then why doesn't it threaten to march to Islamabad to demand the enforcement of
    the rule of law in Swat and the NWP? Why doesn't it demand that the Pakistani
    Army defend the rights of the Pakistani people against the private armies of the
    Taliban, who, after all, operate on Pakistani soil in defiance of Pakistani sovereignty
    itself? Why doesn't it threaten to march to Islamabad demand land reform, rights
    to unionize labor, the subordination of the Army to the civilian government, or
    the development of a state capable of delivering social services to the people
    of Pakistan (such as, for instance, mass education or employment)?  You imply
    that the Lawyers' Movement and Nawaz Sharif's party were responsible for the reinstatement
    of Justice Chaudhury, but you know full well that the Jamat-i-Islami was very
    much involved. Why twist the facts in this way? As for your advocacy of de-linking
    Afghanistan and Pakistan, do you really believe that the two are de-linked in
    Taliban strategy? Are not the Pakistani Taliban ideologically, materially, and
    organizationally linked to the the same elements that the ISI fostered in Afghanistan
    in the 1980s and 1990s and that were for years so integral to its strategy in
    Kashmir? Islamism in Afghanistan in a non-trivial if partial sense came from Pakistan,
    after all."

    naive to me to assert that the wishes of Karachi and Lahore aren't particularly
    relevant -- Pakistani history (sadly) demonstrates the opposite, that these urban
    areas punch way above their weight population-wise.  As for what political forces
    in those cities might resist the Taliban, look no further than the MQM in Karachi:
    I wouldn't call that party progressive, but it is fiercely anti-Taliban (it was
    the only party in Parliament to refuse to ratify the Swat peace deal, and staged
    a walk-out), and most certainly \"anti-landlord\" (though it must be said it is
    easy for it to be thus, as its voter-base is urban, \"Muhajir\", as opposed to
    Sindhi and rural).  It is no more and no less progressive than a host of political
    parties in India, and it is this sort of messy party-ism that has enabled democracy
    to survive in its present form in India.  If one hopes for the same in Pakistan,
    we won't get it by waiting for the mythical progressive, pro-working class party,
    but instead by making do with these sorts of parties.  The subordination
    of the military to civilian authority in Pakistan isn't going to be an \"event\",
    but can only come about as part of a \"process\" (i.e. GIVEN the history of Pakistan,
    by now that is where one is).  While I am perhaps less sanguine about Pakistan
    than sepoy is, I would be inclined to agree that the Lawyers' Movement etc. is
    a first step as far as that process is concerned, and an important one.  There
    is obviously a lot more to be done, but it hasn't been nothing.  I would draw
    an analogy (a very loose one) with Turkey, where too it has been a long process
    (to this day, of course, the military enjoys far too much power in Turkey than
    it ought to; but equally, the civilian sphere is \"broader\" than it was a couple
    of decades ago).  On Iran, I don't think I agree with your assessment that
    the Shah's army was more powerful than the Pakistani army as of 1979 -- I'm no
    expert on this issue, and remain open to persuasion, but would like to hear your
    basis for saying so."

    issue with these rhetorical questions is that one could use this to argue that
    democracy is on the verge of collapse in a number of countries, not just Pakistan.
    \ Using the above logic, one might argue that Indian democracy is on the verge
    of collapse because the state has effectively ceded control over dozens of districts
    across the length of the country to Maoist insurgents dedicated to destroying
    and/or supplanting the Indian state apparatus (that these conflicts are exceptionally
    bloody I am sure you know); one might add that no-one in India's urban populations
    seems to be mobilizing to any significant degree to try and address the problems
    of alienation, exploitation, etc., that fuel the insurgency; or even for the development
    of a state that delivers basic social services to the population; just about everyone
    agrees that the scope of Naxalite/Maoist activities has most certainly been widening
    year after year over the past decade; and in fact Maoist forces have already won
    one war against one South Asian government this decade.  i.e., if one went by
    the above logic one would have to conclude that Indian democracy was also on the
    verge of collapse.  [I don't think it is: I certainly feel that Indian democracy
    is more robust than Pakistani democracy at this point in time; my point is that
    one could make a similar case using the sorts of \"metrics\" the media/analysts
    often cite, as if those metrics settled the question.  The reason no-one makes
    that case is that the wider world is simply uninterested in Maoist insurgents
    in India; heck urban India is pretty uninterested in them too -- i.e. the difference
    in perception is not necessarily based on facts on the ground, but on (as you
    said) a POLITICAL difference.]"

  content: "Thanks for the Fuller link Akbar.  This might be somewhat off-topic, but
    while there is a lot to commend in Fuller's analysis, I do disagree with some
    points:  1.  Fuller criticizes the Obama Administration's policy in part
    because the Afghanistan-Pakistan border cannot be sealed.  But that argues in
    FAVOR of the Administration's policy -- i.e., one could just as easily argue that
    becuase the border is a joke, one can't simply focus on the Afghan side and not
    look at the Pakistani side.  [Stated differently, one can critique the drone attacks
    on the grounds of civilian casualties; or on the grounds that the tactics (e.g.
    drone attacks) might not serve the strategy (destroying Al-Qaida) -- or that even
    if it does serve the strategy (and both the Administration and the Pakistani government
    seem to agree that it has put enormous pressure on Al Qaida/\"foreign fighter\"-types),
    it might well have the potentially dangerous side-effect of de-stabilizing Pakistan;
    but not on the ground that Fuller cites.]  2.  Fuller's point about India
    being the biggest geo-political threat to Pakistan ellides the crucial question:
    i.e. is this NECESSARILY the case?  For instance, Germany was clearly France's
    biggest geo-political threat in 1914, and in 1939, but obviously not in 1959.
    \ Fuller seems to see the question of the threat posed by India in static/eternal
    terms.  Just two days ago Zardari said he didn't regard India as a threat to Pakistan
    -- while one can pooh pooh this as the words of a weak civilian President under
    immense pressure from all quarters, he has been very consistent on this point
    ever since he took over the PPP.  There is no reason to believe that the Pakistani
    military's perception of threats to the country are the same as the civilians',
    not to mention that within the \"civilian\" category one will find a great diversity
    of opinions."

    is an expression of "hegemony of the ruling class"--a rather un-dialectical understanding
    of ideology and consciousness. What you need to interrogate is the crisis of Marxism/consciousness
    that emerged and re-emerged over the course of the 20th century since the defeat
    of the Russian revolution, and it is within this history of the Left that Gramsci
    et al. will appear as a symptom and problem of fascism/Stalinism/Maoism--all of
    which were affirmative ideologies of Marxism. By the time we came to Said and
    Foucault et al, social consciousness, historically, had regressed farther and
    farther to the right, and post-colonialism/post-modernism is a problematic instantiation
    of this historical regression. So perhaps what you need to brush up is going to
    the basics, i.e., Marx.'

    Revolution was an event/process in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The American New
    Deal was driven by political forces in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
    Chicago. Indian independence was chiefly won in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai.
    Political organizational capacity is always concentrated in the cities. But I
    think the Jamaat-i-Islami (among others) has already demonstrated its strength
    in the cities of Pakistan. It doesn't need a majority. The kind of \"revolution\"
    the Pakistani Taliban has in mind will be the result of a plebiscite. I'm not
    contemptuous of the Lawyers' Movement, I am just saying let's not exaggerate its
    strength and significance. There were much stronger secular forces in Pakistan
    when Zia came to power than there are now. Forces rooted in the Pakistani trade
    union movement, for instance. As for the Shah, his military was the anchor
    of the American alliance structure in Asia - the most important American ally
    west of Japan and South Korea. During the White Revolution (and with a state budget
    that dwarfed that of Pakistan), the Shah undertook a massive (quasi-fascist) modernization
    program during which Iran became quite wealthy by regional standards.  With extremely
    disastrous effects, the Pakistani Army only began to receive something approaching
    the attention and military aid from the U.S. that it got because the Shah fell
    (and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan). To gauge the strength of the Iranian military
    in 1979, one only has to consider the fact that it fought Iraq to a draw in a
    catastrophically prolonged war, despite the country's near-total diplomatic isolation
    and Saddam's enjoyment of massive western support. In other words, Iran fought
    the Iran-Iraq War with the army it inherited from the Shah.   I would seriously
    disagree with the claim that the likes of the MQM in Karachi built Indian democracy.
    The \"mythical\" pro-working class parties in India were and are legion - the
    CPI (very largely responsible for the unionization of workers in the 1950s and
    60s); the CPI(M); the (many off-shoots of the) CPI(ML); Ambedkar's ILP in the
    1930s, the Shetkari-KamgarPaksha of the 40s, 50s, and 60s; the Socialist Party
    of the 50s, 60s, and 70s; and, yes, the Congress under Nehru. Whatever the problems
    with these political parties (and there are many others), they do not deserve
    to be coupled with the likes of the MQM in Karachi."

    the Taliban. The BJP might be guilty of this fallacy, but we shouldn't be. Personally,
    I don't consider the Maoist victory in Nepal  a \"collapse\" of any kind. My problem
    with the Nepalese Maoists is that they are incapable and unwilling to push forward
    with revolutionary politics in Nepal and, in the end, they will betray their own
    followers. Still, the revolution in Nepal is great achievement, in my opinion.
    And while, as I say, I have criticisms of the Naxalites, I would argue that their
    victories contribute to democratization in India. If there was a Naxalite movement
    in Pakistan, it would be fighting the Taliban. As for the claim that, \"no
    one in India's urban populations seems to be mobilizing to
    any significant degree to try and address the problems of alienation, exploitation,

  content: Fascism was the "socialism of fools". Like modern-day Islamism, it was
    an attempt to escape, step back or retreat from capitalism. The mass extermination
    of the Jews was an attempt to negate the values of money, banking, international
    cosmopolitanism, and thus "society" in favor of national "community". What Atiya
    is saying is that the Stalinist line of "socialism in one country" (the nationalization
    of socialism) - which was "affirmative" in the sense of substituting for a project
    of the global overcoming of capitalism a state-capitalist project of economic
    development and social regimentation) - paved the way for fascism (aka National
    Socialism).

  content: "Indian democracy was not built by such parties, but it thrives and lives
    in them, because of them, despite them.  It does not survive and persist because
    of the legacy of the 1950s -- it thrives in and because of numerous parties that
    are like the MQM: almost entirely dependent on the support of x or y community
    or group of communities, and whose ideology is often the capture of state power
    for the interests of those group.  I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily,
    when one considers the alternatives on offer.  Thus I don't think it is insulting
    to compare the MQM to these sorts of parties -- which are the principal parties
    in large parts of India, and arguably the majority of the country (given that
    in a state like Bihar, even a so-called \"national\" party like the BJP is really
    no more or less a \"caste-party\" than the RJD or the JD(U)).  Other parties that
    could easily be grouped with the MQM are the Samajwadi party, the BSP, the Akali
    Dal, the Shiv Sena, really the list could go on and on.  The point isn't that
    one can draw no distinctions between these parties -- one can and should; but
    none of them easily fits your litmus test of the pro-working class progressive
    party.  There just aren't that many of those in India, and the examples you cite
    were (barring Nehru's Congress) hardly the driving forces of Indian politics in
    their eras (confined to this or that region, and not very significant at a national
    level), and over time gave way to the parties we see today, almost all of them
    peddling a sort of identity politics that would not pass your litmus test, and
    loosely comparable to the likes of the MQM or the other mainstream Pakistani political
    parties.  [Nehru's Congress, of course, died by his daughter's profoundly illiberal
    hand, and whatever was left was formally buried by Indira and Sanjay Gandhi in
    the fascist experiment, complete with forced sterilizations, of the \"Emergency\".
    \ Even Nehru's Congress was of course hardly liberal through and through -- in
    the key states of U.P. and Bihar, responsible for the large bulk of its legislators,
    the party was not dominated by its left-wing at all; numerous RSS-types were in
    the party post-1947.  i.e. rather than drawing a distinction between \"Congress\"
    and \"BJP\" one ought to say that the sorts we find in today's two national parties
    were both found in the Congress in the post-1947 period.]  Re: \"But I think
    the Jamaat-i-Islami (among others) has already demonstrated its strength in the
    cities of Pakistan. It doesn't need a majority. The kind of
    &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; the Pakistani Taliban has in mind
    will be the result of a plebiscite.\"  You seem to want it both ways: on
    the one hand you speak of political parties and electoral strength, but when convenient
    you say that the likes of the Jamaat-e-Islami \"doesn't need a majority\" as it
    \"has already demonstrated its strength.\"  But where is this strength come election-time?
    \ And if Indian democracy can survive despite the permanent fascism and hooliganism
    of the Shiv Sena and other Sanghi groups, why should the demonstrated strength
    of the Jamaat outweigh all electoral considerations?  On the Naxalites:
    they do not bomb schools, but they do disrupt elections, kill pollworkers, mine
    public roads, attack policemen, and mete out brutal punishments to those suspected
    of collaborating with the government against them -- they are not the Taliban,
    but they are a far cry from Soderbergh's Che.  On balance the Indian state has
    only itself to blame, and a military solution to the issue isn't feasible or just,
    but the point here is not the cuddliness of the rebels, but about the challenge
    posed to the nation-state."

    that reads fascism as a retreat from capitalism, but as a manifestation of a terrifying
    possibility within European nationalism.  The strain of thought that built the
    nations of the continent can be traced rather easily from the nineteenth century
    through 1848 to fascism, and one hardly needs Marx to show the way.  [In any event,
    I had understood Atiya to be referring to Nazism as a manifestation of a kind
    of MARXISM -- not as a manifestation of the totalitarianism of Stalin. ]  One
    might usefully add Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism here, who explicitly draws
    a link between colonialism/imperialism (particularly in its scramble-for-africa-form)
    and the practices of the 20th century totalitarian regimes (she of course did
    see Hitler's and Stalin's regimes as more alike than different).  For Arendt,
    the practices of the European colonizers in Africa -- who, as she put it, for
    the first time legitimized \"wild murdering\" as a respectable part of the foreign
    policy of civilized nations -- had far more to do with Nazism and Stalinism than
    Marx's thought.  In any event, the direct line from Stalinism's socialism
    in one country to fascism doesn't quite work, given the chronology of Mussolini's
    seizure of power.   Re: \"...&ldquo;affirmative&rdquo;

    are you suggesting that the Marxism of Nazism lies in the fact that it REPLACED
    the Marxist project -- \"the global overcoming of capitalism\" -- with \"a state-capitalist
    project of economic development and social regimentation\"?  If so, that is an
    argument for why Nazism and Stalinism are like each other, not for why fascism
    proceeds from Marx.  In fact, you seem to be saying that Nazism and Stalinism
    REJECTED Marx's project in similar ways (I am inclined to agree)."

    an environment for left/progressive politics as India is.  My point is that the
    sorts of metrics bandied about everywhere over the last several weeks and months
    don't mean much, because the same tidbits could be used to paint a number of societies
    as in the throes of a terminal crisis.  Thus, the Naxalites are more progressive
    than the Taliban -- but surely it is not any such tendencies that explain why
    the world doesn't foucs on them.  The world doesn't focus on them because the
    world has no interest in them, and is not threatened by them. Their ideology is
    beside the point (the history of Latin America shows that anyone's progressive
    ideology is hardly going to save one if one is a threat).  Thus, Qaddafi and Saddam
    Hussein were/are incomparably more \"modern\" than the Taliban -- but, quite naturally,
    Saudi Arabia's regime got a lot more positive coverage in the media than Qaddafi
    did circa 1986.  I do not \"blame\" any media for this -- nothing else could be
    expected --but it is a red herring to cite the progressive ideology of the Naxalites.  If
    Indian democracy depended on the organizing potential and politics of the Left,
    it would have been dead by now.  The Left is a very anemic popular phenomenon
    in India, outside of West Bengal (where, I would argue, whatever progressive force
    it represented was dissipated years and years ago), or Kerala.  Today, even the
    trade unions in major Indian metropolises like delhi and (of course) Mumbai do
    not feature much Left activity (in the case of Mumbai it is the Shiv Sena).  Yet
    a certain sort of democracy persists -- and it is possible that such spaces could
    be maintained and could persist in Pakistan as well.  There is no guarantee that
    will happen, but I on balance I don't see the need to write-off the possibility
    because the Taliban are in control of Swat (there are other reasons why I would
    be pessimistic, beyond that one)."

  content: "Completely off topic: I recently read Mazower's \"Hitler's Empire\", and
    I can't recommend it enough; a superb examination of how the Nazis administered
    the territories under their rule (or, one should say, the different ways in which
    they administered the different territories under their rule).  A good juxtaposition
    with Littell's \"The Kindly Ones\" (an indulgent novel that, ultimately, I do
    not think justifies its nearly 1,000-page length, but (in its middle sections)
    is the best recreation I have come across of the mindset of \"total war.\"  ...well,
    perhaps not completely off-topic: as I wrote the above I was reminded that for
    Mazower and Littell, the elimination of the Jews did not represent any retreat
    from capitalism, but was a function of \"total war\".  [This doesn't get one all
    the way there, of course, as I take it your point might be that the hatred of
    the Jews, the marking out of Jews as beyond the pale, itself represented the retreat
    from capitalism.  I'm not persuaded by that either, inasmuch as Nazism was able
    to draw on venerable anti-Semitic archives and registers, going back all the way
    to the founding of institutionalized Christianity (even as Nazism was not reducible
    to those archives and registers); once the relevant subject of politics was defined
    as \"the people\", the Jewish \"other\" was always a likely candidate for stigmatization.
    \ I do not view this as the Nazis hearkening to a pre-capitalist past, but as
    the ongoing construction of a \"people\" that had already been put in play by
    European nationalism -- which wasn't understood as contrary to capitalism as it
    was understood then.   Inasmuch as the nation state was seen as the very summa
    of modernity (it still is, as the sad and bloody history of the once-colonized
    demonstrates daily), the figure of the Jew, by not being reducible to the national
    paradigms of Europe came to be seen as both stubbornly BACKWARD (i.e. refusing
    to accept the new paradigm of nation co-extensive with state co-extensive with
    people) and simultaneously as SUBVERSIVE (for supposedly owing loyalty to a trans-national
    ethic; and for supposedly having relatives etc. across national borders).  I suppose
    the canard and slander about nefarious Jewish trans-national networks of finance
    etc. does reflect unease with capitalism, but I don't think the anti-Semite bastions
    of industry and private enterprise saw it that way.  [We tend to define \"capitalism\"
    as the free and unfettered movement of capital globally, and across national boundaries;
    but as a historical matter I am not sure that was how it was seen in the nineteenth
    century.]"

    as unconnected to national imperatives, the development of the nation (as against
    any other nation), etc.  This was as true in England as in America -- thus no-one
    thought capitalism was incompatible with protectionist measures, and is partly
    why the scramble for colonies seemed reasonable to the European powers.*  Whereas
    TODAY we tend to think of protectionism etc. as un-capitalist, i.e. we focus more
    on the free flow of capital aspect of it, whereas they focused more on the private
    enterprise aspect of it.  *[It is surely no coincidence that the Axis powers
    were precisely \"latecomers\" -- both to the game of nationalism, and hence to
    the game of imperialism.  Britain and France could afford to be status quo-ist,
    because their scramble for land and resources, and the concomitant crimes, lay
    in the past. For Germany, Japan, and (pathetically) Italy there were not many
    non-white parts of the globe left, and for them status quo would mean second class
    status.  A disgusting sense of entitlement, for sure, but by no means foreign

  content: "A few quick points. The point is not that Islamism is truly anti-capitalist,
    but that it imagines itself to oppose forms of heteronomy characteristic of modern
    society. Needless to say, I agree that any islamist state that might emerge would
    be perfectly \"capitalist\" just as the european fascist states were perfectly
    \"capitalist,\" irrespective of their delusions about volksgemeinschaft. The point
    in identifying an ideology as a form of reactionary anti-modernism is not to imply
    that it actually represents any alternative (other than a more degraded and unfree
    form of capitalism).   I don't think the medieval history of anti-semitism
    tells you much about Nazi exterminatory anti-semitism (or about modern islamist
    anti-semitism). These are ideologies rooted in capitalist subjectivity. The key
    in my view to understanding the total break involved with modern anti-semitism
    lies in the analysis of \"Auschwitz,\" i.e. industrialized mass murder. No medieval
    anti-semite ever dreamt of extermination of a people and no medieval pogrom ever
    attempted it (as Arendt, among numerous others, makes clear). Formative for my
    thinking about fascist anti-semitism have been Horkheimer's \"The Jews in Europe\"
    and Horkheimer and Adorno's \"Elements of Semitism: The Limits of Enlightenment\"
    in The Dialectic of Enlightenment.   I don't think you can get very far
    in understanding Nazism as a form of \"imperialism\" (unless by that you mean
    the \"colonization\" of Europe itself). On the contrary, Nazism had a strong anti-imperialist
    element, as Subhas Chandra Bose and numerous Iranian and Arab nationalists realized.
    Even the Japanese postured as liberators from the imperial yoke.  As for
    \"no-one thinking capitalism was incompatible with protectionist measures,\" I
    would strongly disagree. Adam Smith certainly thought so, and he was only recapitulating
    a tradition that went straight back to the Glorious Revolution. Borderless capitalism
    became an actual fact in the mid-19th century, much more so than it ever has been
    in our time (though I agree that Germany, the U.S., and others quickly developed
    protectionist measures)."

    made Jews -- as opposed to someone else -- a candidate for extermination (as I
    said, Nazism was not reducible to those ancient archives/registers, even if it
    necessarily drew on them).  The two are not the same, but that history made a
    certain group likely targets.  It would have been very difficult for Nazism to
    turn on a ideology that held up Calvinists as the fount of all evil.  I of course
    accept \"the difference\" that modern technology (that is, following Heidegger's
    \"The Question Concerning Technology\", thinking about this in terms of a mindset,
    and not simply as mere instrumentality).  Re: \"I don't
    think you can get very far in understanding Nazism as a form of &ldquo;imperialism&rdquo;
    (unless by that you mean the &ldquo;colonization&rdquo;
    of Europe itself). On the contrary, Nazism had a strong anti-imperialist element,
    as Subhas Chandra Bose and numerous Iranian and Arab nationalists realized. Even
    the Japanese postured as liberators from the imperial yoke.\"  That is exactly
    how the Nazis themselves understood it -- at least where \"the East\" was concerned.
    \ The Hitler/Himmler vision of German \"settlers\" all across the East, up to
    the Urals, and explicitly modeled on the American experience, is nothing if not
    colonial, in the sense that we have seen in North America, New Zealand, Australia,
    and South Africa.  The mind-boggling numbers that would have been needed to be
    displaced or murdered make the experience more analogous to South Africa than
    the others, although theoretically quite comparable (of course, the context within
    which this was happening -- the war -- and the huge population, combined with
    the methods of industrial conflict, made this bloodier than anything seen before
    or since).  In other words, I am entirely in agreement with those who have demonstrated
    that the Nazis introduced TO EUROPE methods that had previously been used, on
    a smaller scale, in Africa (including to exterminatory effect; the Germans themselves
    had all but wiped out the Herrero community in Namibia, to take just one example).
    \ Thus, you are probably correct that \"[n]o medieval anti-semite ever dreamt
    of extermination of a people and no medieval pogrom ever attempted it\" -- but
    nineteenth century colonialists DID dream of exterminating entire people, DID
    attempt it, and DID succeed (the peoples were \"out of the way\", in Africa, and
    have not had the same claim on the world's sympathy that other victims, more like
    us, have had).  The point isn't that no distinction may be drawn, but to examine
    the history that that Europe's twentieth century exterminatory manias were heir
    to.  It would be quite an omission to not examine the role played by 19th century
    imperialists  -- given the nazis' frank admiration for and imitation of these
    methods; nor was this a later development, as right from the days of Mein Kampf
    we see Hitler holding the American \"solution\" to the Native American \"problem\"
    as one that could be applied to Europe.  On Bose, Iranian and Arab nationalists
    and Nazism, I remain highly skeptical that this says anything about the anti-imperialist
    content of Nazism; what it DOES testify to is that the enemy was a common one,
    namely Britain and France.  After all, we wouldn't say that Stalin's alliance
    with Britain and America testified to Stalinism's greater affinity for those countries
    than with Nazi Germany.    [I suppose Nazism COULD have had an anti-imperialist
    element, if we take seriously the notion that every \"volk\" should be master
    of its own destiny.  The problem was that very early indeed, it was clear that
    Nazism was not going to allow any other \"volk\" very much latitude, certainly
    not in the East.  Leaving aside the ethical issues, this was obviously imbecilic,
    as the further Germany pushed into Slavic territory, the less reason anyone would
    have to cooperate with Germany, and the Nazis blew an opportunity to capitalize
    on anti-Stalinist sentiment.  But as I read the record, this wasn't due to the
    betrayal of the anti-imperialist element of Nazi ideology, but the result of a
    contradiction between two different tenets of that ideology, namely Lebensraum
    and the need to secure the utopian settler future for the German farmers/landholders
    who would supposedly colonize the East; and the right to \"volk\" self-determination
    that by implication non-German races would also aspire to.  The latter remained
    a most under-developed aspect of Nazi ideology, let alone statecraft, and it is
    hard for me to take it seriously.]"

    - they simply don't exist outside activist and left-wing circles. Leftist thought
    outside the intellegentsia has very limited impact because of its unwillingness
    to engage the rural peasantry and landless labour directly and the small and fragmented
    nature of the urban proletariat. The bulk of the media is very centrist and conservative
    - and have you even looked at the bulk of the vernacular media, hardly leftist
    or liberal. The fact that there are 20 small leftist or activist groups waffling
    on about the latest nuclear deal and producing pamphlets etc. doesn't mean it
    is read by more than a narrow band of people.

    scopes (thank you, Pankaj Mishra et al for spreading the fear of the 'red corridor

    a monarchistic \"government\", with much support from the population (something
    that nearly every non-Nepali--including the parachute journalists who were 'covering'
    the elections and transition to a federal government-- has managed to miss or
    failed to observe). I don't want to discount the guerrilla tactics and violence
    the Maobaadis used, but it' also worth remembering that the majority of the 13,000
    that were killed during the civil war were killed by the government army and security
    forces, not the Maobaadis."

    I suppose more to the point, they are lazy and, certainly, Amy Goodman and Juan

     The fact that nobody \"takes seriously\" the rhetoric about the Hindu-Zionist-Crusader
    conspiracy (itself a debatable point) is that, before I posted, nobody seemed
    to contest the claims about the \"western media\" either. The point I was making
    is that Sepoy made claims about the vitality of the public sphere in Pakistan,
    so I was pointing out that not every \"diversity of opinion\" is indicative of
    a vital public sphere. And the dismissal of journalists concerned about the capitulation
    of the Pakistani Army to the Taliban (which has in fact been happening) as the
    mere \"hyperventilation of the western media\" is politically to suggest that
    such concerns are foreign to the people of Pakistan, a claim that I (and innumerable
    Pakistani comrades) would vociferously dispute. When you ask, \"So now we are
    bigots for having a free pass for clowns in Pakistan media?\" I would say, \"that's
    for you to answer.\" Certainly, I believe there is such a thing as virulent Third
    Worldism, nationalism, and racism in Pakistan (and, indeed, the discourse about
    the HZC conspiracy clearly expresses it). After all, Pakistan is a country that
    has over the last six decades very largely expelled its minority populations,
    whose military perpetrated horrific atrocities in Bangladesh in 1971 (that still
    unacknowledged in the mainstream Pakistani media), and in which mixed-race and
    mixed-religion marriage, etc. (nevermind gay rights, open promiscuity, or even
    the outward expression of female sexuality) are effectively quashed. The onward
    march of the Taliban is, of course, deeply complicit in consolidating precisely
    these most despicable trends in Pakistani politics and I say they deserve condemnation.
    Sepoy, in his commentary on Democracynow!, hardly spared a word for these matters.
    He is a good friend, but politically I disagree extremely with this sort of obfuscation.
    I think it perfectly fair to call it out as \"nationalist\".   As for your
    points about Iraq, I think the idea that the invasion of Iraq was the result of
    a lack of public information is misleading and incomplete. I would say that the
    information available to the public in the United States was, because of the ready
    availability of first-rate newspapers, magazines, and books, as great or greater
    than in any other nation on earth. If you want to get to the bottom of ideology
    (if ideology is what motivated the (American public's acquiescence in the) invasion
    of Iraq), I think we would have to go much deeper than speaking simply about insufficient
    information."

    have used as the base of their electoral strategy in north India for the last
    30 years with a reasonbale level of success; though of course they have used the
    idiom of caste and not class.  <i>I don't think anybody
    has looked at it - it's too vast. I can read with pleasure
    only the Marathi press and while certainly are differences between the English
    and the Marathi press, I don't think there is any ideological
    divide</i>  This is quite a simplisitic statement but that might be because
    I primarily read Hindi and I can tell you the press here covers a lot more than
    just 'local' news. It plays an important
    role in forming opinion and presenting facts on a wide range of issues; especially
    state govt policy, communalism and the whole issue of reservations. The ideological
    divide here is huge with the English press, I am stunned that anyone would even
    claim otherwise. Perhaps it is different with other regional vernaculars.  <i>There,
    because of the power of the CPI(M), one finds plenty of &ldquo;leftist&rdquo;
    commentary (as one does in the English press in Bengal), so, I would say there's
    not much point in generalizing about the indian vernacular press, either.</i>  Dunno
    about this; Ananda Bazaar was always pretty hostile towards the CPM(M) and in
    the English press so was the Telegraph. Only the Statesman was left of centre
    and even here CR IRani made it very clear that his philosophy was for the media
    to act as an independent check on power and as a sort of informal opposition.
    Something that always enraged Alimuddin street; I remember interviewing several
    PB members who used to get abusive about this paper in particular. The CPM(M)
    has had a pretty antagonistic relationship with the media; only of late did it
    learn the art of 'spinning'. I only read
    the Statesman these days and it hardly qualifies as a &ldquo;leftist&rdquo;
    paper though it takes a progressive stand on many issues.  <i>The Left is
    weak everywhere, but I don't think the Left any more prone
    to &ldquo;waffling on&rdquo; than any other political persuasion
    (on the contrary).</i>  Umm, actually I would completely disagree with you
    here; I think you are quite disconnected from ground realities. Many left groups
    care a lot about ideological issues that other parties don't
    bother with; most of the regional and caste parties do anything but waffle. Parties
    like the BSP, SP, JD, and even the Congress are very tuned in to concentrating
    either on highly symobolic issues, creating social coalitions through the use
    of code-words and concepts and appealing to particular interests. They spend very
    little time on actual waffling; attending some of the election rallies at least
    in northern India UP, Haryana and Delhi which is where I have most of my experience
    reveals this very clearly."

  content: "Adorno dispensed with Heidegger a long time ago, as far as I'm concerned.
    Certainly, in my opinion the critical dialectical tradition is far more conceptually
    rigorous, explanatory, and profound (without needing to call attention to its
    profundity a la the Sage of the Black Forest). But, as you say, we can agree to
    disagree on this. Okay. The Ward Churchill bit was a cheap shot and I'll refrain
    from those in the future. My problem with the colonial genealogy of fascism is
    not that it diminishes the significance of the Holocaust, but that it obscures
    the distinctive character of anti-Semitism as an ideology and the Final Solution
    as an event.  As for the simple question of treating populations as dispensable,
    that has deep roots in Britain and France and can be seen in the mass killing
    of the european working poor and New World slaves under the vagrancy laws, inhuman
    working conditions, etc., in the 17th and 18th century. So, I think it needs to
    be clarified what it is we are going to the colonies to explain.   Regarding
    the native Americans, I think it is altogether misleading to isolate a certain
    admittedly barbarous and not-to-be-forgotten-or-diminished 19th and early 20th
    century history of brutality with the entirety of the American experience in this
    regard. I'm not saying you are doing this exactly, but I am just making my position
    clear. There was a great deal of inter-marriage and assimilation that no comprehensive
    history of the North American \"encounter\" can rightly deny. My own maternal
    grandmother's grandmother was Cherokee. I don't know the details of her story,
    but certainly the historical record shows innumerable native Americans entering
    into the mainstream of the American labor market and settled areas for essentially
    voluntary reasons. Those stories don't fit into the defense-of-tribal-traditions-and-lands
    narrative of the identity historians, but is no less historical for that. And,
    I will say that I fundamentally agree with those europeans and Americans - people
    like John Locke and Benjamin Franklin - who considered it worthwhile to conquer
    America for liberalism."

    I said that such things are said in the mass media and that they are deserving
    of condemnation, perhaps far more so than the editorial limitations of the New
    York Times. When people say that Blacks were better off here as slaves then
    in Africa they echo the sentiments of numerous African-American leftist intellectuals,
    who have argued precisely that it is better to have lived as emancipated slaves
    in the heart of liberal capitalism, than to have lived in sub-Saharan Africa.
    The argument has very often been used in African-American circles to argue against
    back-to-Africa separatists. It's not an inherently racist statement. Of course,
    it was East Pakistan. Where did I imply otherwise? The actions of the Pakistani
    Army treated the Bengalis as a subject people and not as fellow nationals in a
    civil war. Are the rapings and the wholesale slaughter of unarmed students and
    professors commensurate with the description of the war's being a civil war? Clearly,
    AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE, the difference between the Bangladesh
    War in 1971 and the (Non-)war against the Taliban today is a political difference.
    the issue of \"atrocities\" tells you nothing whatsoever. \"Atrocities\" are committed
    in every war. The Nazis were the victims of terrible \"atrocities\" perpetrated
    by the Allies, but that fact tells you nothing about the politics of World War
    II.  The Pakistani Army was fighting against democracy  in East Pakistan. It
    was bloodily suppressing anything that could have been the constitution of Pakistan.
    Full Stop. The opposite would be the case were the Pakistani Army to expel the
    Taliban from Pakistani territory, since, after all, the Taliban loudly proclaims
    its hostility to the laws and constitutional order of Pakistan."

    character of anti-Semitism as an ideology and the Final Solution as an event.\"  It
    does not; it simply recognizes that distinctive ideologies, that \"newness\",
    is not creation ex nihilo.  Even the Final Solution has a history, a genealogy
    (the Final Solution is an \"event\", something new, and is of course not reducible
    to that genealogy).  To take one example, as I mentioned earlier, the legacy of
    Christian anti-Semitism explains why Jews would be the \"enemies\" above all others
    for the Nazis (as opposed to Catholics).  To take another example, the legacy
    of European imperialism and settler-colonialism helps explain how Nazism got to
    where it got to.  It doesn't get one all the way there, but I never said it did;
    that's so obvious as to be banal.  I think the fundamental disagreement
    between us on this point is that you seem to be suggesting that the legacy of
    imperialism and settler colonialism sheds NO LIGHT WHATSOEVER on Nazi practices,
    the Final Solution, etc.  I read the historical record very differently (and my
    claim is rather modest on this point) -- I might add that you have offered no
    narrative/argument/reasoning that would account for it, you simply have asserted
    repeatedly that it is misleading to adduce examples from that history.  I repeat
    my earlier question: HOW is it misleading?   Re: \"What about the concentration
    camps for the Boers? Wouldn't that also be a part of the story?\"  I
    certainly never claimed to be citing every relevant example.  The Boers I did
    think of, but did not cite them for a rather banal reason: I am quite unfamiliar
    with that conflict, and thus stayed away.  Re: \"I'm
    not sure that Hitler was ever simply motivated by merely practical considerations
    (such as the duration of the war) to implement the Holocaust as the Final Solution
    to the Jewish Question.\"  Two points:  1.  I obviously agree with
    you that Hitler was not \"simply motivated by practical considerations\" to kill
    millions of Jews -- for the simple reason that absent a certain ideology, it could
    never have been necessary to kill millions of people in this manner.  2.
    \ You misunderstand the point I am making: my point is that the Final Solution
    was -- notwithstanding Nazi ideology -- not the first resort of Nazism, but the
    last.  I don't think there is serious debate on this: the historical record is
    very clear that the Nazis preferred the emigration/reservation/Bantustan \"solution\",
    and when that proved unachievable, decided to kill off all Jews.    [Somewhat
    tangentially: (2) does not make the Nazis \"less\", but in fact MORE atrocious
    in my eyes.  If it is possible to \"grade\", this admixture of instrumentality,
    one might even say the impersonal nature of the Final Solution, is even more de-humanizing
    than the sheer hatred that leads one to want to harm the other.  With the latter,
    one has the dignity of an enemy; with the former, one is nothing, and may -- to
    use Agamben's formulation from Remnants of Auschwitz -- be \"killed without crime\";
    I've always found that more disturbing.]"

    be honest you actually didn't do this. Initially you made a
    point at a general level about &ldquo;numerous media outlets&rdquo;
    which you later qualified several times. Saying that left wing party have their
    own media products is kind of pointless, given that few read them outside the
    supporters of these parties and even here there aren't too
    many serious readers. The Hindu-Frontline family are the only exception in the

    scale.</i>  I think that is a simplistic and incorrect analysis of party
    organisation of the Left in India. In West Bengal, there was a concerted attempt
    to win over key sections of the rural peasantry and marginal farmers; ranging
    from sharecroppers to the jotedar class. It was this strategy that paid divided
    after the 1977 elections and is the base of the CPI(M)'s support;
    this network has increased through expansion of the surplus farmers and other
    intermediaries in the PRI system further entrenching party rule in the countryside.
    The CPI(M) has only managed to organise the formal workers in the industrial sector;
    it has failed quite miserably in organising and mobilising those in the informal
    sector; like most Left parties in India. In anycase, a purely 'worker'
    based strategy won't get you very far in India given the preponderance
    of the rural population and the restricted nature of Indian capitalism that has
    a dual-sector characteristic. In adopting the path of parliamentary socialism,
    rather than revolution; the CPI(M) has had to address this issue and built up
    its rural programme which saw it come to power.  <i>So you think the Hindi
    press represents something like a different world, a different subjectivity than
    does the English press? Are there two Indias, one that speaks the vernacular and
    one that speaks English? I don't think so.</i>  Oh yes,
    the Hindi 'public sphere' is very different
    from the English one; the political idioms and the concepts are very distinct.
    These two overlap somewhat and people move in both spheres but they are quite
    distinct; which is why the English media get caught napping on how the vernacular
    sphere views issues such as reservations, communalism, minority rights etc. Language
    apartheid is a fact in India; the only thing I will say is that given the status
    of English; I have seen an almost unbridled desperation by hindi-speaking parents
    as well as illiterate ones to make sure that their children get some access to
    English-medium education. Unfortunately, English is still seen as the route to
    social status and mobility. Lastly, I kind of wonder what you are basing your
    arguement here if you can't speak Hindi and so don't know what the vernacular
    press in this language is like?  <i>In urban Maharashtra (in Pune, Nasik,
    and Mumbai, for instance) it is very common to find people subscribing to both
    an English and a Marathi paper. In fact, the biggest Marathi paper in Pune, Sakal,
    has recently launched an English edition</i>  I don't
    think urban Maharashtra is very representative here of India. This is the case
    in South India from what I am told as well. My experience really recounts what
    is happening in the Hindi belt- where most of the population actually live.  <i>You
    make my point about Bengal for me. The point was that it's
    hard to generalize.</i>  No, actually if you read what I said; I didn't.
    The largest language daily in Bengali is not leftist at all and neither is the
    Telegraph; the other main English daily, the Statesman can be said to be mildy
    progressive on most issues but is no a left-orientated newspaper, at least on
    economic policy. Simply having some liberal social views and endorsing a secular
    line, hardly makes one a 'left' paper. My
    point was the exact reverse of what you were saying.  <i>I don't
    really see as particularly virtuous being decisive about non-issues or in the
    outright mass obscurantism in which non-left (and Stalinist) parties engage. I
    would rather view that decisiveness itself as expressive of a deeper authoritarianism.</i>  Yes
    and no. The problem with traditional left thinking is that they have no answer
    to the language and idiom of caste; which is the sharp reality in much of northern
    India; and effectively they have abandoned any adherence to an alternative economic
    strategy as their state govts show but merely are implementing reforms &ldquo;with
    a human face&rdquo; so why should those outside the upper caste elite
    pay much heed to them? The only stream to take a lot of the burning social issues,
    especially in the countryside seriously are the Naxalites, something acknowledged
    by those Dalit intellectuals who disagree with them and which is why the Naxalites
    have proved so resilient and difficult to eradicate, even in the most reactionary
    and violent parts of the country."

    situation, but in any case, there is no comparison: in East Pakistan in 1970,
    the Pakistani army (aided and abetted by Bengali collaborator groups, most prominently
    the Jamaat-e-Islami) murdered anywhere between 1.5 and 3.5 million people, an
    astounding kill-rate (I am not aware of more precise figures).  Another 10-15
    million people fled, and (again these are imprecise estimates) several hundred
    thousand women were raped, perhaps the largest incidence of mass rape since the
    Soviet assaults on German women in Eastern Europe, or the 1947 savageries of India's
    partition.  Whatever we call this -- genocide (by some estimates, 50% of those
    who died or fled were Hindus; in any event, the notion that Bengalis were \"Hindu-like\"
    or \"half Hindu\" was an integral part of the rhetoric, and thus it was a kind
    of genocide by proxy) or gendercide (90% of those who died were men, again consistent
    with General Tikka Khan's reported objective to kill Bengali men and rape women
    so that \"the next generation will be half Punjabi/Pathan\") or ideologocide a
    la Khmer Rouge (a conscious attempt was made to kill \"intellectuals\", lefties/Commnist
    party members, and groups (e.g. Hindus) imagined to be supporting those parties
    (I guess the Nazis too drew similar links between Bolshevism and Nazism)) -- there
    is surely no comparison with what is going on in Swat right now.  Not suggesting
    Akbar is drawing such a comparison, but still.  And on '71, I am more sympathetic
    to Spencer L's point: Akbar, \"the nation\" cannot be absolved of the atrocities
    in East Pakistan because, while the details of the killings and the rapes were
    not known, there was widespread view that the Bengalis were \"traitors\", and
    that they needed to be \"taught a lesson\", etc.  It is glib in the extreme to
    say that because both groups were Pakistanis, the victims' \"innocence\" rubs
    off on those who did nothing (by this yardstick, both Hindus and Muslims in Gujarat
    2002 were Indians/Gujaratis; Germans and (at least German) Jews were both Germans,
    etc.)  1971 has long been Pakistan's biggest blind spot, and to this day there
    is no reckoning, no discussion, no acknowledgment."

    people should think carefully before lumping everybody with a \"BEARD and Shalwar

    this thought of  Muslim Caliphate taking the world over, kept GWB awake at night
    for 8 years,and he had 28% approval while leaving  office.So those 28% delusionals
    are still out there. This \"Taliban in Pakistan \" issue has come to center stage
    like wild fire in tandem with Obama's policy announcement of  AF-Pak. What is
    happening in Pakistan is extra judicial Killing of its own citizens at the hands
    of military, (especially SWAT has a very distinct history  until 1969, when a
    dictaotr Yahya Khan Federalized it.). They have rights just like Bengalis had
    and just like all Pakistanis do.  So if we are ashamed of happenings in Bengal,
    then believe me people are going to be ashamed of these atrocities also. Now comparing
    \ even all of Pushtuns some 40 million on both sides of border with Nazi's etc
    is simply Lunatic and fringes on delusion. A better course for noble well wishers
    of Pakitan would be to read the  1973 constitution of Pakistan (Preamble of the

    entire Universe belongs to Almighty Allah alone, and the authority to be exercised
    by the people of Pakistan within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust;......Wherein
    the Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective
    spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out
    in the Holy Quran and Sunnah) Now this constitution was ratified by elected
    representatives from all four provinces. I am not a great fan of this but what
    Swatis  are demanding is their comstitution right, unless the democratically elected
    parliments amends the constitution to the liknigs of us all,  and help the
    democratic set up work.What is not being discussed is that since August of 2008,
    two things happened   1) The drones attack have increased inside Pakistan.Here
    is what Ron Paul has to say about it while questioning Mr Holbrook http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2009/05/10/ron-paul-why-escalate-into-pakistan/  2)About
    sametime, US military aid to Pakistan was stopped, failed state rhetoric was everywhere,
    that crashed the stock market and foreign investors fled, economy crashed Rupee
    suddenly went fro 60 per dollar to 60/dollar. So that is the classic tactics that
    empires use to squeeze unruly satraps. Now that military again started  extra
    judicial killing of its own citizens and emergency AID is on the way, bills are
    in the congress and even IMF gave relaxations yesterday.Now who are we kidding

    PEPE Escobar has to say about pipelinesatn, http://original.antiwar.com/engelhardt/2009/05/12/pipelineistan-goes-af-pak/  On

    ARMY, because that is only cheao alternative. Believe me they are not upto the
    job, Iam no fan of military but they were incompetent, atrocious retards in East
    Pakistan in 1960s, they did the same in Balochistan in 1970s, again replay in
    Sindh and Karachi in 1980's to both sindhis inder ZIAand Mohajirs ,later. So all
    the  noble well wishers of womens rights / enlightened moderation be careful while
    putting all your bets on military."

  content: Isn't Pakistani society allowed to have it's own values? The fact that
    you think that Pakistanis should  support gay rights, "open promiscuity" or the
    expression of female sexuality is fine, but what if that's not what the Pakistanis
    themselves want? Like it or not, Pakistan is very much an Islamic society, and
    the majority of Muslims cannot support gay rights (even if we would want them
    to). Open Promiscuity is another matter. Even I, as a  generally left-of center
    person, am uncomfortable with this idea. It seems to me that you fault Pakistanis
    for not agreeing exactly with your value system? Why should we? Are we not allowed
    to have a value-system of our own? Does Pakistani democracy necessarily have to
    reproduce the values of US democracy?

  content: "I'm not sure I follow all these comments on racism: seems to me sepoy
    is critiquing certain reporters for having a certain worldview, a certain ideology
    -- he doesn't seem to me to be critiquing them on account of their ethnicity/cultural
    background.  Where does the racism come in?    Secondly, I find it odd that
    a blog/writer who has (just to take examples from recent weeks) criticized the
    Taliban's imposition of jaziya on Swat's Sikhs; questioned the nationalist myth
    of Pakistan's founding that is the bedrock of the \"standard\" account of the
    nation's birth; and routinely criticized the military that has acted as the self-appointed
    guardian of Pakistan's national well-being for most of the last five or six decades;
    should be accused of nationalist obfuscation.  i.e., while I am (somewhat) less
    sanguine about Pakistan than sepoy is, I don't see his greater optimism as allied
    to \"orthodox\" Pakistani nationalism -- I am all too familiar with that phenomenon,
    and it has a very different flavor than Chapati Mystery does.  Re: \"They
    have rights just like Bengalis had and just like all Pakistanis do. So if we
    are ashamed of happenings in Bengal, then believe me people are going to be ashamed
    of these atrocities also.\"  I think Akbar has articulated a very important
    point here: the number of people displaced in a mere 1-2 weeks is mindboggling.
    I have previously argued in CM (and still maintain) that I do not believe the
    Taliban cannot be dealt with without some use of military force, but the scale
    of displacement here raises some serious questions, perhaps about the Pakistani
    military's competence (the BBC has aired multiple refugees claiming that army
    shelling has been utterly indiscriminate; that houses and livestock are being
    destroyed, etc.), or perhaps about its good faith -- does it/the government want
    to raise the stakes to show the world that it is serious/deserves aid, a kind
    of political theater as it were?  I should add that the Indian establishment does
    not appear to be convinced by the drumroll of experts announcing the imminent
    failure of Pakistan -- perhaps this proceeds from India's paranoia of Pakistan,
    or perhaps India has good reason for believing so, but my point is that it is
    surely not only crypto-nationalists who do not believe that the Taliban (actually,
    IMO, the multiple groups operating under that name) are on the verge of causing
    Pakistan to implode."

  content: Qalandar, I think you are absolutely right about the distinction between
    pluralism and liberalism. From the tone of Spencer's comment, I got the sense
    that he thinks Pakistani culture/society should reflect the values of US society.
    This is clearly problematic. If we use the example of gay rights, even in the
    US there are many states that are against the idea of gay marriage. Even president
    Obama has said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman.  To then expect
    an Islamic society (and one where the discourse is getting more religiously-oriented
    by the day) to be in favor of gay rights is foolish IMO.  Much as we may want
    to see a liberal, secular Pakistan, we have to realize that it's not going to
    get there right away and that Pakistani culture is different from Western/European
    culture.  I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that.

  content: "This is related to various comments made about East Pakistan.  I think
    the discussion has somehow conflated two different issues; 1) the current failed
    state narrative and 2) an analysis of ethnic conflict within Pakistan based on
    the East Pakistan experience.  I believe we need to decouple the two - here is
    why:  The current orchestration of the failed state narrative by the Obama
    administration is very tactical and short-term oriented.  It is an effort to apply
    public pressure on the Pakistani government to make it support the floundering
    war in Afghanistan by taking military action against the insurgents.  There is
    very limited leverage that can be applied to Pakistan - about the only leverage
    left is aid money.  The Pakistan aid bill has been in front of congress and the
    failed state narrative gathered steam in the last few months reaching a crescendo
    at the time of related congressional committee hearings in the last few weeks.
    \ Now that the hearings and the aid bill are done and whatever limited Afghanistan
    war support could be got out of Pakistan has been worked out, my prediction is
    that we will see very little further failed state discussion.  It could rear its
    ugly head again if the situation on the ground in Afghanistan gets worse, which
    is quite possible.  Re. the East Pakistan discussion.  Of-course, the presence
    of genocide in Pakistan's history does not have anything to
    do with future state failure, just as the history of Native American genocide
    has nothing to do with the potential for state failure of the United States -
    life is never fair.  The East Pakistan discussion and more broadly a discussion
    on the history and potential future scenarios for ethnic conflict in Pakistan
    is an important discussion that should be carried out but it will not be a fruitful
    discussion if it is carried out within the context of the current tactical, narrowly
    focused, goal-oriented American orchestration of the failed state narrative.  If
    we ignore the failed state narrative and focus on the potential for future ethnic
    conflict, then it is entirely appropriate to discuss the East Pakistan experience
    and draw conclusions about the future direction of the current military operations
    in the NWFP.  While the current military operations are not ethnically directed,
    the potential exists for the war on the Taliban to morph into multiple ethnic
    struggles.   Theories that this will lead to the further dismemberment of Pakistan
    (ala East Pakistan) are far-fetched.  But such ethnic conflict could lead to large
    scale violence.  A discussion on strategies for pre-empting this dynamic would
    be quite appropriate for folks with some empathy towards the Pakistani people."
