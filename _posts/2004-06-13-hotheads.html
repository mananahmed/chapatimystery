<p><a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_13-6-2004_pg7_7">This</a> made me laugh. It did. Jama'iat (IJT) got pissed because Allama Iqbal Medical College students were having a water balloon fight. A water balloon fight!! The nerve of those students to do that when the temperature is hitting 105C. My glee, though, came from flashbacks from when I was in college in Lahore. I remember IJT just like that, pissed off that others were having fun. Going out of their ways to disrupt parties and gatherings and <i>musha'iras</i> because these things were un-Islamic. Some see narrow-minded religious paranoia in those actions, but, I always enjoyed them as a desperate cry to let them in. They wanted to have fun too but on account of their pesky <a href="http://www.jamiat.org.pk/">fraternity</a> rules, they couldn't.</p>
<p>Most funny, though, was that IJT accused the med. school students of participating in <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/index.html">Holi</a>. Now THAT is a serious threat to the IJT. After all, IJT and it's parent organization <i>Jama'at-Islami</i> have promoted Hindu-hatred throughout the 50-odd years of Pakistani existence. This is no idle threat to them. Notice this article entitled <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-735409,curpg-1.cms">India is Hot n' Happenin in Pakistan</a> from the Times of India. It contains this helpful chart: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Indian Flavor in Pakistan</b></p>
<li> Hottest Movie: <i> Kal Ho Na Ho</i>
<li> Hottest actor: Shah Rukh
<li>Hottest actress: Preity Zinta
<li> Hottest song: <i> It's the Time to Disco</i>
<li>Hottest male: John Abraham
<li> Hottest cricketer: Rahul Dravid/Irfan Pathan
<li> Hottest dish: <i> Dal Makhani</i>/ Butter Chicken
<li>Hottest socialite: Dina Wadia/ Maharani Gayatri Devi
<li>Biggest crowd puller: Priyanka Gandhi
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am serious in saying that this chart will find its way onto a Jamaati pamphlets and this kinda stuff puts a serious hate-on in them. It's the drumbeat of pop-culture, people. Eating Chicken Makhani will not make you Hindu. Neither does cheering Irfan Pathan make all of India Muslim (and pathani?). Learn to live. In peace. Ah well.</p>
<p>Maybe the med. school kids should throw some water balloons at the IJT kids. Just everyone cool down, no?</p>
