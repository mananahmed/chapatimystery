    actually come out on the streets and protest against organisations like Jamaat-ud-Dawa,
    Lashkar-e-Taiba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan?"

    they deserve" has broken down entirely, doesn't it?

  content: Nitin - I'm waiting for that day too. It would be the true revolution.
    Right now <a href="http://www.sananews.com.pk/english/2009/03/13/long-march-sit-in-to-be-held-qazi/"
    rel="nofollow">Jamat e Islami</a> (father of all evil parties you mentioned) is
    active in these protests too. Ironic isn't it but they don't have a vote bank
    so they always try to benefit from crisis.

    parties were as powerful as the military and debased political elite; then such
    a sentiment would be understandable. Otherwise, I don't see why litmus tests like
    these need to be applied to marginal extremist groups. Nobody in India expect
    mass protests against the various extremist fringes of the BJP or the Shiv Sena
    when they are in power; these Islamist groups are far less powerful in Pakistan."

  content: 'This current movement of Lawyers is about restoration of rule of Law.
    It has been very resilient. Dogar Supreme court has delivered the PML(N) to this
    movement by banning  Sharif brothers and now the eastablishment (Zardari?) has
    delivered Journalists to this movement by banning the Geo TV. At this point this
    movement needs practical help from all the well wishers of Pakistan, in any form
    it could be delivered and not a list of demands. I think once the rule of Law
    is eastablished then the other war i.e: GWOT can be fought and won in a Pakistani
    perspective. Unfortunately the movers and shakers catch a cold feet when it comes
    to eastablishment of rule of law.'

  content: 'The question "when will they come in the streets against lashkar etc"
    is not a good question for this movement. This movement is probably the only hope
    there is of preventing the Islamic Khmer Rouge from coming to power.  The corrupt
    and criminal establishment is the force that denies people their rights and robs
    them of their freedom and self respect. I understand that one day, this establishment''s
    demise may be followed by the rule of "the army of the pure" which will make the
    rule of the current impure army seem like heaven...but that is exactly why sensible
    people have been begging the powers that be to please see the writing on the wall
    and move towards slightly more fair, slightly more inclusive, slightly less criminal
    rule. "the people" are not perfect. They can make mistakes. But they are far more
    pragmatic and realistic than the zardari/kiyani establishment. Whenever they are
    given a chance, they vote for corrupt parties, NOT the "army of the pure". Why?
    because they know what the "educated" establishment does not seem to know: that
    even a corrupt semi modern state is better than a wild rush into "pure justice".
    but all they are getting in exchange for this supreme realism and level headedness
    is more oppression, more exploitation, less services and less respect. There IS
    a limit though...and when we reach that limit, the elite will run away to dubai
    and Washington and lament the ignorant fools who threw out the gilanis and zardaris
    and invited in Baitullah Mehsud.....'

    Court justice are appointed by the President, so why Pakistani President isn't
    allowed to choose his/her own Chief Justice?  Why so called religious parties
    (JI etc.) didn't come out on the roads when War Lords and Mafia supported by them
    burned girls schools?"

<p>Since 2006, the ordinary people of Pakistan have repeatedly mobilized, peacefully and forcefully, in the streets to 1. kick a military dictator out of both army and civilian power 2. get an election done despite the assassination of a popular leader and 3. keep the matter of justice and the judiciary alive and come out against the civilian regime of zardari after it broke its campaign promises. </p>
