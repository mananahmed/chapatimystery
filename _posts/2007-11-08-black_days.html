  content: "The situation is insane.  If I were in Pakistan, I know I would not protest
    because ultimately there is no point.  But I have heard from relatives in Islamabad
    involved in both peaceful and non-peaceful protests.  Of course the violence has
    not been on their side, but the cause of the government and police.  And they
    have broken bones as a testament.  Whatever 'normal' is, let's hope things return
    back to that.  I'm not one who likes to place fault on just anyone.  But
    can there be any doubt this disaster is being controlled by America?  What a shame
    that Pakistan is a puppet nation, controlled by the U.S. government for many years."

  content: "Oh, please.  The American government is always what lays the groundwork
    for the huge muddles that manifest themselves later on.  Wasn't it the U.S. who
    introduced and encouraged the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan during the fight
    against the Soviets in the Cold War?  Wasn't it the U.S. who gave Musharraf a
    perpetual blank check because he was needed to help fight against the \"terrorists\"?  Of
    course, things never seem to work out as intended, right?  The nations and the
    innocent civilians are the ones left to deal with all the B.S. that the \"great
    minds\" of the U.S. managed to leave behind.  Every current affair that
    takes place today must be analyzed within the spectrum of the past two or three
    decades - at least - of history.  Very little happens spontaneously.  There is
    always a cause and effect.  If you truly want to understand the mess Pakistan
    is in today, please go back to the beginning."

I would go buy a black suit but I think I might break some Pakistan Bar Association or Johnny Cash Appreciation Society rule. So, in the meantime, just more news.</p>
<p>It is heartening, seriously, to see so many people, putting so much time and effort, and standing up by the side of Pakistanis. Some upcoming protests in the United States (thanks to <a href="http://www.kalhan.com/wordpress/2007/11/08/rally-nyc-lawyers-nov-13/">Anil</a> for sending word):</p>
<blockquote><p>
   <b>Washington, D.C.</b>:  Demonstration to express opposition to General Parvez Musharraf's declaration of a State of Emergency on November 3, 2007, his order to suspend the Constitution and his subsequent actions against judges, lawyers, activists, journalists and academics. Where: Pakistan Embassy in Washington, DC When: Sunday, November 11, 2007 from 1-3:30PM.</p>
<p>   <b>NYC</b>: As an expression of solidarity with our beleaguered colleagues at the Pakistani bar, the New York City Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, and the New York County Lawyers' Association, in conjunction with other organizations, invite you to attend a public rally in front of the New York County Courthouse, 60 Centre Street on Tuesday, November 13, from 1:00-1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The crude and brutal suspension of law and the legal system in Pakistan, and the repression of judges and lawyers there, require that we take a moment from our own busy schedules and demonstrate our concern.</p>
<p>Because the images from Pakistan show the violent repression of Pakistani lawyers wearing their customary dark suit and white shirt, we request that you appear on Tuesday in similar attire, though this is not required. What is important is a strong show of support. We hope to see you there and encourage you to distribute this as widely as you can. Thank you.</p>
<p>  <b>Akron, OH:</b> Let's show our support.  Bring yourselves (and even a sign if you wish), and come to the Courthouse. Let's send this out to your/our list serv(s) to spread the word. It may be last minute, but  it is a small sacrifice (infinitesimal) that we are making, compared to that which our fellow lawyers are in Pakistan.</p>
<p>See you Friday at noon in Akron -- try to make it there, or anywhere a courthouse can be found!</p></blockquote>

<p>I will be away from the internets for the next 2 days. Send me news, if you can, via email.<br />
