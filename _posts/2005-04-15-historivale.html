Irfan Khawaja's <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/11331.html">post</a> on Jalianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919 and Weekend Fisher's <a href="http://christiancadre.blogspot.com/2005/04/messiah-talmud-on-messianic-prophecy.html">post</a> on Talmudic Messianism caught my eye. As well as this <a href="http://littleprofessor.typepad.com/the_little_professor/2005/04/anne_boleyn.html">excellent</a> post by the little professor on representations of Anne Boleyn. Sounds <i>very</i> familiar.</p>
<p>Now go read the best that History has to offer in blogistan.</p>
