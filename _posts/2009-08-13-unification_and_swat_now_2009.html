  content: "the only downside to a summer in Istanbul is missing the pleasures of
    a summer in NYC.  ps: Hari Kondabolu is a) teh funny, and b) a fellow traveler
    of the Blue Scholars crowd back in Seattle.  He and Sabzi and Geo did a little
    foto/food tour of queens and blogged it all here: http://harithecomic.blogspot.com/2007/08/tour-of-queens-with-blue-scholars.html

<p>About Seeds of Peace<br />
A 501(c)(3) public charity founded in 1993 by journalist John Wallach, Seeds of Peace is dedicated to empowering young leaders from regions of conflict with the leadership skills required to advance reconciliation and coexistence.</p>
<p>In 2001, Seeds of Peace launched a program for Indian and Pakistani youth from diverse economic and religious backgrounds.  Through a year-long program and the coexistence program at the Seeds of Peace International Camp in Maine, Indian, Pakistani and American facilitators challenge the youth to open the wounds of history and delve into the religious, political and territorial battles that have sown so much mistrust and bloodshed.  Over the course of the three-week coexistence program, insults, tears and rage are gradually replaced by words of compassion, understanding and sincere attempts at reconciliation.</p>

<p>About BROWNSTAR<br />
In a sky of black and white,<br />
a BROWNSTAR shines bright.</p>
<p>BROWNSTAR is a two-man spoken-word duo bursting forth from the pens and dreams of emcee-poet-performers PUSHKAR NORTH STAR SHARMA and SATHYA SOUTH STAR SRIDHARAN. Grown in the Heartland of America but Flavored with the Masala of the Motherland, BROWNSTAR shouts what often goes unheard, giving BROWN a voice and song&acirc;&euro;&scaron; presenting a fresh perspective and exploring the contradictions, complexities, and epiphanies of South Asian identities.  Utilizing original performance pieces, BROWNSTAR walks the tightrope of hyphenation, their stage show ignites a conversation about South Asia and its diaspora, exploring everything from Kal Penn to Rushdie to the legacy of Gandhiji and the contemporary politics of The-Louisiana-Governor-Formerly-Known-As-Piyush. BROWNSTAR reveals its unique perspective while asking those timeless, human questions about our world, our galaxy, and our universe.</p>
<p>About THE BROWNSTAR REVOLUTION<br />
THE BROWNSTAR REVOLUTION unites socially-minded BROWN artists, thinkers, and revolutionaries -- creating a nexus where new and needed voices can forge a fresh conversation on hyphenation, identity, and diasporic politics. THE BROWNSTAR REVOLUTION unites ALL BROWN, embracing our ability to walk forward together - not just as hyphenated-Americans, but as one people: To believe that this is possible and necessary is to be a BROWNSTAR.

<blockquote><p>Friends, Family & Colleagues,</p>
<p>We are reaching out to you today with an urgent call to action! As you may know, the impending humanitarian crisis in the Swat Valley as a result of the ongoing military operation in Pakistan has left millions of people displaced. In fact, it is the largest internal displacement in a country since Rwanda and is the largest mass displacement in South Asia since the partition. </p>
<p>The UNHCR (United Nations Refugee Agency) has been providing clean water and shelter in the region since the conflict began. They are looking for our support to help provide aid to the millions of civilians who are caught in the crossfire. <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/emergency/pakistan/global_landing.html">CLICK HERE</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We are hosting an emergency benefit concert on Wednesday, August 19th, 2009 to raise money towards this cause. Headlining this event are DJ Rekha of Basement Bhangra fame as well as the infamous underground producer, K-Salaam. There will also be performances by The Kominas and AbstractVision. Doors open at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>***100% of the proceeds will be donated to the UNHCR and their ongoing humanitarian relief operation in Pakistan, as well as their work in Iraq and Sudan.***</p>
<p>This project is fueled by a singular directive: that one of the most potent ways to improve the public image of Islam here & abroad is to unite under the very Islamic banner of "goodwill towards all mankind." But, of course, we can't effect change in the world around us completely alone...</p>
<p>WE NEED YOUR HELP! Please click on the links below to make your donation TODAY! PLEASE RSVP at <swatnow2009@gmail.com> to receive discounted admission to the show. Tickets are $8 advance/$10 at the door. Check out the attached flyer for more information about the event.</p>

Ali & I would love to see all of your supportive, music-loving faces there on AUGUST 19th! </p>
<p>SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT EVENT!!! Please forward this message to everyone you know!</p>
