  content: "<i>Gawker Intern Neel Shah thinks he understands. Hailing from picturesque
    Port Jefferson, Long Island, Neel is a first generation Indian-American who took
    the SATs in 7th grade, went to the same dorky summer program at Johns Hopkins</i> This
    is funny. I imagine they mean CTY. I also did CTY--but I haven't really thought
    about it in over a decade, and it probably came up like once or twice during my
    entire high school and college careers.  In fact, a bunch of my classmates
    did CTY. We didn't think there was anything dorky about it, and though we joked
    about how it was a ticket to a good college, it ended up not even being mentioned
    on (at least my) app. We beat the shit out of the grade 7 standardised exams and
    then took the SAT with no algebra background as 12 year olds. How is this coming
    up by twentysomethings peeing on each other? Should I have mentioned CTY in
    my apps? Would I have gotten in to one of my top 7 then?"
