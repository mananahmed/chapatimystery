  content: "Her death is a big jolt to Urdu literature. She was the tallest writer,
    and apart from Intizar Husain, I see none alive of the stature close to her.   Unfortunately
    we have had no big novel in Urdu in the recent years and there is no promising
    writer anywhere is sight. Prose is nearly dead."

<p>"There was no one like her when she was alive. Future generations will place her above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismat_Chughtai">Ismat</a> and the rest. She was the best writer of her generation, male or female. And said more and more profoundly than any of them. Her place in Urdu literature is secure beyond anyone else's, except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadat_Hasan_Manto">Manto</a>." --- <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/naim/index.html">Naim</a></p>
