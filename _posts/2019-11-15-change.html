The history of this blog is also the history of blogging software. Chapati Mystery started as a hand-cranked site running on an Apache server in my university job I held as a database programmer. It next became part of [Movable Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type) perl-revolution for serving web-blogs on one's own hosted servers. When MT crashed *as it would often do*, I moved it to a php/database model that [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress). It has been hosted on my own paid server-space since then.

However, in the past some months, I have had hackings and other malignant messes to deal with. The cost of hosting the site has ballooned to $150/yr for a few years. I think, the blog has cost me, in terms of hosting and domains, around $10,000 since 2006.

I have also been thinking for a while that *Chapati Mystery* represents a unique archive of the conversations driven in Pakistan, India and the diaspora since 2004. The posts, the guest posts, the comments are all a microcosm of the many ways in which digital and political culture evolved in the first two decades of the twenty first century.

I want to make available this archive to scholars to study--within the data centered approaches. It is driven by these concerns of privacy, cost, and future sustainability that I have transitioned CM to http://github.com. This will allow the entire archive of CM to be available as a public repo for anyone to use. I am excited about this opportunity. I am thankful to @elotroalex and @muziejus for giving me their expertise and time for free to make this happen.

We are still fixing a lot of small and big issues. But I hope all will be fixed shortly.
