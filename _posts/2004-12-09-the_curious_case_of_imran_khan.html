    "So, what does this say about Pakistani political landscape?"

    I never knew Pakistan actually had a political landscape.

    I always thought it was run by a collection of semi-feudal overlords, who rely on nepotism and sycophantism.

    Speaking from personal experience that is.

  content: 'A pertinent issue u have raised, Sepoy. It''s important to analyze such
    cases as Imran''s to understand the political milieu of pakistan. One of the reasons
    of Imran''s failure as a politician is (perhaps) one that u have mentioned: that
    is, he does not have  friends in Washington. But I guess, a major factor is the
    apathy of the people towards politics, towards  the idea of taking charge of their
    own destiny, towards anything that is beyond the immediate issue of survival and
    subsistence. They have probably lost faith in revolutions, reform, progress or
    related ideas. Perhaps, what can move them, if at all, are someone like Bhutto
    with his shenanigans and loud oratory skills.'

  content: "Yes, a very sad case is his. \nAnalyzed from the general public outlook,
    I always thought it was his move of taking a gori wife, his divorce unfortunately
    sent the message further that he did not make a wise decision. If he couldnt make
    the right choice in his life, how could he make the right choices for the country? I
    personally, was willing to overlook that. \nGood outweighs the bad in his case
    for me; why can't the awam of Pak see that? \nWe really don't know and care to
    know what's going on like Sohail said. What can be done? : \\"

  content: And we in India almost elected a <i>gori</i> wife of a previous prime minister
    (this isn't a sarcastic statement). Also, I am not sure how not having Saudi/American
    backing would be an issue in elections. I believe, the single reason for his failure
    is that he did not have a strong grass-roots campaign. Even in a well-connected
    country like US, the "foot soldiers" do make a difference in the elections. Or
    am I missing something here?

  content: pakistan is a country sufficient in emotional fools, regarding the failure
    of PTI i will only say that there is great difference in sports leadership n politics
    one. the movt of tahreek e insaf ended with the completion of shaukat khanum where
    as the fact is..............pakistan needs more, more n even much more foundations.
    2dly we r a country with 70% poors community, imran should contribute with the
    whole pakistan..........

  content: I think he realises the situation on ground and trying to make some adjustments
    with some political parties having the same one point agenda of restoration democracy.
    That might not be an ideal situation for an ideological party but in this way
    he might be able to build his political image and contribute for the betterment
    of masses while in reign (coalition). I am hoping for his best political future
    in the upcoming elections.

    is poor. My dear the figure is about 32%. Perhaps you are talking about 1949 figure
    but we are in 21st century, try keeping up with the facts.

  content: i would say its a bit premature to regard imran khan as a failure. i personally
    feel he has a long way to go in politics yet the opportunity is just about right
    to make inroads into pakistani politics. there is a lack of credible leadership
    and he is showing strong on various talk shows in political debates. his personal
    life i pray is not going to haunt his political life for he seems a genuine person
    to me

  content: "Imran Khan is not a failed politician. He also isn't a dirty politician.
    That's my opinion, because he was already rich, well off, popular etc and he didn't
    need to get into politics. He was also doing great charitable work.   He
    is one of the very few people who I have hope and faith in. Not blind faith, just
    hope and faith. I couldn't care less about his \"gori\" wife or his divorce. Pakistan
    has been riddled with Pakistani men with Pakistani wives sucking Pakistani blood
    like leaches. It's time to give Imran Khan a chance."

  content: Every democratic country has two or to the maximum three main political
    parties, Republican Party, Democratic Party in USA, Liberal Party, Labour Party,
    Conservative Party in UK, for instance. Imran Khan's straightforwardness, selfless
    and daunting approach is welcome, however, His political future is bleak as long
    as he has ambiguity in accepting his role in one of the two mainstream parties
    in Pakistan, PPP and PML. PML (N) is in APDM and that's where he should go hands
    in hands with Nawaz Sharif to step into active opposition politics which will
    eventually pave his way towards a real statesman in future.

  content: 'I''m a bit taken aback to read sepoy''s post on Imran Khan: I think he
    was never able to inspire the same affection/allegiance from Pakistani liberals/"English
    medium" classes because he was seen as a hypocrite -- someone who had found religion
    (not to mention cultural authenticity and a cheap/facile anti-American attitude)
    rather late in the day.  Stated differently, it was in fact the very power of
    Imran Khan''s image, its potency, that has HARMED him in politics IMO -- because
    his image is not that malleable, and has hindered his attempts at re-invention.  [A
    useful contrast may be offered with the legendary Tamil superstar and subsequent
    Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G.R., who also had a larger-than-life image but
    was able to make it the vehicle for a rather malleable politics that could and
    did mean different things to different people.  Chiranjeevi is trying to replicate
    the same in Andhra Pradesh.]'

  content: To clarify (I didn't articulate it very well above), not all images/personae
    are equally malleable, and while Imran Khan was "big", the NATURE and QUALITY
    of his persona was such as to make re-invention difficult; and some of this was
    a function of the fact that the political narrative he wanted to construct around
    his own persona was at odds with the glamorous narrative of his life in many ways.  [In
    the M.G.R. example used above, the politics was presented as a logical continuation
    of the on-screen persona].  This muddled thinking has hurt Imran Khan IMO (it
    has also hurt Rajnikanth, the biggest movie star in Tamil cinema since M.G.R.
    but one who has not been able to walk that fine line straddling "stands for something
    definite" AND "can be many things to many people", which ability is, I feel, a
    sine qua non for the celebrity-turned-politician).

  content: If we want  pakistan to prosper we need to get honest with our selves first.
    Its not about cricket or politics, it all about the leadership qualities in a
    person with strong decision making and imran khan is much capable of it. What
    I think Imran khan is the only man left in politians who really want to do something
    good for pakistan with honesty  rather then filling his pockets full of corruption
    like others..! I being honest with my self  will vote for imran khan this time
    not any of my relative standing for MNA or MPA...! We r still not late and easily
    get through with problems of energy crisis, terrorism,inflation, unemployment,  Pakistan.
    Due to his good geografical localitiy has a lot of resources which r being extracted
    by american companies ! All we need is honest people to govern our country , if
    this happened we will never be MAUHTAJ of others and would not be depending on
    foreign Aids.

<p><img src="/img/imrankhan2.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Yesterday I linked to an essay by Imran Khan. Something has bothered me for a while and I think I will hash it out here. <i>Why has Imran Khan failed in Pakistani politics?</i> </p>
<p>Imran Khan, from '85-'95, was Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and Joe Montana rolled into one. He retired from Cricket (after winning the World Cup) and started a project to build a free cancer <a href="http://www.shaukatkhanum.org.pk/">hospital</a> in Lahore. For this project, he solicited donations, did fundraisers, gathered monies from NGOs, all to guarantee that the poor have a world-class facility. I can't even begin to describe the goodwill and cheer he accumulated through his philanthropy.</p>
<p>Then, he decided to enter into politics and established the <a href="http://www.insaf.org.pk/">Tehrik-e Insaf</a> [Movement for Justice] to foster an agenda of anti-corruption and development. He should have been elected PM in under a month. Yet, he has struggled to be taken seriously by our politicians or public. He still makes more news through his personal life than through his political one. He attacked the major parties as being corrupt and exploitative of the public and that not only cut him out of the immense organizational structure required to engage in local politics but also made him a political pariah. The religious parties had no use for this recent playboy with a <i>gori</i> wife. He went through phases of political wranglings and compromises [even doing the mullah bit - for like 5 seconds] which destroyed his reputation of being a non-compromising gentleman among theives. </p>
<p>His party never won any seats to speak of and he has barely managed to get elected in the few chances he has had. After 9/11, he criticized US foreign policy and has been by-and-large <a href="http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/nov/11inter1.htm">anti-US</a> since the Afghanistan war. If you don't have friends in D.C. and you don't have friends in Riyadh than you ain't got a chance in Islamabad. His latest move is to lead a <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_27-11-2004_pg7_19">XI-strong</a> against The General. He is trying to emerge as the leader of a unified front - akin to the M.R.D. against Zia in '81. The thing is that MMA is doing the same thing. Chances are that Imran Khan will get sidelined, once again.</p>
<p>So, what does this say about Pakistani political landscape? Why can't an immensely popular and well-liked individual take a populist platform and still fail to gather any support as a leader. Masses are malleable only to the ones in power? Or is this a unique case? In the absence of any <i>desire</i> for change, can Pakistani civil and political society re-allign itself against The General? Don't I have any shot at becoming the Manmohan Singh of Pakistan?</p>
