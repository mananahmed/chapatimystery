  content: AHhh... i didnt get to see the debate ; but it seems like kerry knocked
    out bush once again!  i'm now more concerned over Kerry's new statement regarding
    tightening the Pak-Afghan Border; Is kerry going to be good for Pakistan?? ??
    All this Bush-Mussarraf-Wana Operation is a REAL mess and those poeple (tribes)
    i know, are now SO angry & never going to support Pakistan anymore in any cause.
    Mussaraff killed so many innocent poeple in that region claiming them to be members
    of Al-Qeeda. I follow bbcurdu radio service and its really shocking what Pak Army
    has done to its own people.!! But First we should get rid of this Bush !!

  content: "How can a non-voter have such a strong opinion? (Re: The Muslim Vote entry)
    And if you believe the RNC could \"steal\" the election (again) why does it matter
    who we vote for? A conspiracy theorist would say, \"if <em>they</em> want Bush
    to win, he will win.\" \n\nThe Republicans have probably scared enough of the
    people of this country into voting for Bush my hinting that a vote for anyone
    other than him will result in the immediate and complete destruction of the Earth.
    \ We're doomed either way.\n\nI'm still partially 'undecided' - id est: should
    I vote or not?  I've registered and I thought at one point I would vote for Kerry,
    but after reading the Democratic Platform I changed my mind.  Then my mother scared
    me back into believing I should vote for Kerry. (\"You'll just give Bush another
    four years if you vote for Nader!\" \"You're throwing your vote away!\")  Now
    I am disgusted with it all and considering staying home that day.\n\nCan you save
    me? :-)"

  content: "leena: I cannot vote in this country because I am not a citizen but I
    still pay taxes, obey the enacted laws and can be send to Gitmo if considered
    a threat. In other words, I have lots of reasons to care about who gets elected.
    \nThe Republicans will try dirty tactics (just as the Dems tried it before, god
    rest daley sr. in heaven) - but that does NOT mean they will get away with it
    or that it will decide the election.\nVote. You must vote. Doesn't matter where
    you live, and doesn't matter who you vote for. Go to the polls. I, of course,
    will want you to vote straight down the line for Democrats so that we can take
    the Senate or, mayhaps, the Congress. \nAs I pointed out in the Muslims for Bush
    post, it is completely wrong to imply that Bush and Kerry are the same. They are
    not. Whether you care about Civil Rights, Economy, Foreign Policy, whatever....you
    have a choice between two stark realities. \nVote for Kerry because you don't
    want any more Wars or a draft. Vote for Kerry so that America is no longer an
    international bully.\nVote for Kerry so that the bulwarks supporting dictators
    in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can begin to crumble.\nVote for Kerry so that there
    can be some, ANY, \"process\" in the Middle East Peace Process.\nBut don't be
    disgusted and stay home."

  content: No doubt Kerry did better than Bush in the debates, and the American people
    agree with this view, but the polls are still evenly divided between them.  Why?

  content: "Niraj: The convential wisdom is that the electorate is bitterly and evenly
    divided and that is the way it will be until Election day. But, historically,
    independents and undecideds break for the challenger late. \nThe polls, of course,
    are largely should be taken as \"trends\" rather than \"facts\" - given dubious
    sampling and weights not to mention that they do not catch the cell-phone only
    crowd or the first-time voter crowd.\nStill, it will take a few days for the \"impact\"
    of these debates to show up in the polls and the punditry."

<p><img src="/images/debate.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6><b>3-0</b>. This was Our Fearless Leader's best performance. And the saddest. Confession time: I don't hate George W. Bush. I detest his policies, his rudimentary grasp of the world he so profoundly inhabits, his oedipal fixation on Iraq, his cultivated homeliness. And his overtly expressive face. But, not the man himself. He is not evil incarnate that some of us want him to be. For example, I like the way he molds his body to the podium - leaning into it, resting his elbow on it, grasping it, hitting it. He comes across as intimate and alert. He expresses everything without <i>verbalizing</i> anything. And last night, he expressed it all. He was animated in the beginning but then his body just fell silent. He quit moving and leaning. He didn't look at the camera, just at the talking Kerry or Bob. </p>
<p>He was lost. And tired. </p>
<p>His heart is not in it. He has no answers and he doesn't even "get" the question. By which, I do not mean that he is too dumb (never believed that, either) but that he doesn't understand the relevance or the implications.<br />
Around 40 minutes into the debate, Bush gave up. He wanted to be anywhere but where he was. Like a robot from the past, Kerry bombarded him with lists of failures and grievances. George blinked. He sighed. He implored Bob with a dry chuckle saying, "WTF!?". He did not scowl or grimace like the first debate. Lesson learned. But he could only scream Education over and over and over. On playgrounds, in our youth, we used to stick our fingers in the ears and yell at the top of our lungs: NANANANANANANANAANAN. Education. </p>
<p>There just is no domestic argument that he can present. His best case was Iraq. He blew that chance in Debate 1 and the daily headlines blow away his best-case scenarios every morning (pun intended). Tax cuts matter to a lot of people. And those people vote Republican. Kerry is not convincing any of them. Terrorism is the other factor. Again, the Republicans somehow believe that Kerry will ask the terrorists for a group hug or something. Kerry showed that he will deal with it just as well as Bush will. After all, he has personally killed brown people.</p>
<p>During these three debates, the majority of the country saw a President capable of handling domestic and foreign issues and willing to work with other people. Kerry. I think he will get the biggest lead yet of the race by the middle of next week and that it will tighten back up within days of the election. E-day will be all about getting people to the polls and stopping the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/13/15534/960">RNC</a> from stealing the election.  </p>
<p>I am leaving for Madison tonight. I have yet to write my presentation. Something about Early Modern India. Damnation. This conference business will kill me. But, hey!, the next one is in Hawaii.</p>
