  content: "Speaking of recommended links, I think our Pakistani friends (who have
    likely mostly seen this anyway) will get an especial kick out of this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzy-HeYYfro  And
    for those who get their kicks hearing Sheikh Rasheed get abused:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yozjh-S4Ec
    \ (funny but sad too; I don't follow Punjabi well but nevertheless)  And,
    so Karachiites don't feel left out:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IS-WAgoe8o"

  content: It's been really rather fantastic so far - I am very happy with the MEC
    and St. Antony's in particular and also some of the South Asia courses, which
    I am sitting in for. Eugene is actually my academic supervisor here - he's wonderful.
    Let me know if you're heading here at any point!

  content: That's great. I hope to visit Oxford sooner rather than later. Just drop
    my name around the watercooler and maybe I will magically get an invitation. What
    SA courses are you sitting in?

  content: Well just a couple actually - the main S Asia Seminar series which runs
    for two terms and is chaired by Polly O'Hanlon. We did Mughal successor states
    today! It's been rather fun so far - better than the ME Seminar series, which
    is sad, since that is my core course. And literary Urdu - reading Manto (Mehmooda
    and Toba Tek Singh once we finish that) and Umrao Jaan.

<p>I been sending the usual links I would hoard for this occasional post over to <a href="http://twitter.com/sepoy">twitter</a>. But, it has been too long, yes? Some links to tide over the long Sunday:[play Cohen's <i>Avalanche, Famous Blue Raincoat</i> as you read]</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacqueline Rose, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n21/jacqueline-rose/a-piece-of-white-silk">A Piece of White Silk</a>, <em>LRB </em> is absolutely must-read - for such careful examination of anything, let alone honor killing, is rare in our times.
<li>Tracy McVeigh, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/oct/25/honour-killings-victims-domestic-violence">Ending the silence on 'honour killing'</a>.

<li>Hari Kunzru, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/oct/31/michael-haneke-films-hari-kunzru">Nowhere to hide</a> looks at the movies of Michael Haneke. Very much recommended.
