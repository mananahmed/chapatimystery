<p><img src="/img/franz.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Our mutual friend, Paul K., had the good sense to go on a trip to Poland with Franz Ko&#X10d;ka and document the experience.<br />
Franz is an excellent tour guide to Eastern Europe who had me in stitches. Please go see the <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/1.html">pictravelogue here</a>. My favorite entry is <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/16.html">this</a>: "He will strive all his life without reaching it."<br />
Ha.</p>
