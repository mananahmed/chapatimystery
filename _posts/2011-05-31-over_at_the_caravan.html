  content: "Excellent article both of them (and I discovered a new magazine more to
    my liking!). I am also surprised at the editor's cut :-(.  I can empathize
    with Bilal's article on Faiz as  had a similar introduction to Ghalib with his
    Shareef-Urdu but was thankful to Sardar Jafri's convenient translation into Hindustani.
    But atleast am thankful to Indian publishers for making it available at Rs. 20
    this was in 80's. (now probably Hinglish tranlation will be required  :-)"

  content: "Ways of seeing: Disturbing to the core, not first time, but every time when one read accounts of such indulgence by the deep masters of the land and everything else in it. You may keep on seeing for a very long time before something may happen for the better for the people of this cursed land. The founder today appears to have been ridiculously na√Øve, of not looking beyond the stupidity and narrow mindedness of his Hindu compatriots. There is a price to pay for one's decision, but this one has cost people enormous hardship and still there is no light at the end of the tunnel after sixty-four years."

<p>I have a piece in Hindoostani glossy magazine The Caravan Beta. It is about my research trip to Uch Sharif. Actually, no, but almost about that. Here is a paragraph that didn't make the cut (or got cut, rather) but I liked it:</p>
<blockquote><p>To make conversation, I told him about the Arab migrations of the 8th and 9th centuries to this region. The Qur'an and Had'ith scholars, the muftis, the geographers, the merchants. I mentioned also Richard Burton and his paean to Falconry written in the mid nineteenth century within a couple of hours drive from our location. Eventually, I shut up. His thoughts were elsewhere, and his fingers were nervously fiddling with his many devices. We both fell silent and let the heat and dust slowly envelop us. </p></blockquote>
<p>Read the actual piece: <a href="http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?StoryId=912">Ways of Seeing: Pakistan's paradox of knowledge and denial </a></p>
<p>Also, in the same issue, there is Bilal Tanweer's (CM &hearts; BT) <a href="http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?StoryID=924&Page=1">Faiz for Dummies</a>. Really, read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Carry the book on your bus trip home. Open it at a random page and encounter the words barq faroza'n and sar-e vadi-e sina in the same line. Feel your heart slipping down to your belly. Slam/shut/drop the book immediately. Stare some more at the cover. You vaguely sense the picture of a man. It is a man. A white silhouette on the glossy all-black cover. His elbow rests calmly on a table and his limpid hand is holding a cig. This is the poet. Introduce yourself, say hello. </p></blockquote>
