  content: "According to Robert Temple, <i>The Genius of China</i>, p 173, references
    to kites in China go back to the 4th and 5th centuries bce, including intense
    interest by the founder of the Mohist movement, Mo Ti (aka Mo-tsu or Mozi). Mo
    Ti was an interesting fellow, a sort of pacifist in that he vehemently opposed
    the use of force in politics, and  a sort of militarist in that he and his followers
    frequently came to the aid of beseiged cities and struggling states. Mo's movement
    has left us some of the best descriptions of military tactics and weapons, all
    in the name of eliminating war. The legend cited in the link above appears apochryphal
    (though you could in fact make that calculation with the proper application of
    trigonometry, which doesn't seem to appear in any form until the 3c ce) based
    on my source, but the use of kites as a means of signaling and, later, for delivering
    messages over medium distances (by cutting the string and letting it fall), do
    appear in that earliest era.  There are also references to \"man-carrying kites\"
    as early as the 4c ce, though my source I think overinterprets a reference \"returning
    blades\" to helicopter-like mechanics instead of a flapping motion which seems
    more likely."

  content: If I end up in Lahore for Basant, I'll take many pictures for you.  Did
    you hear, btw, that last year, 20 million rupees' worth of alcohol was confiscated?  I
    can't quite remember if it was pre- or post-Basant, but I'm fairly sure it was
    for Lahore alone.

    Basant is a festival that has no relation with Islamic mode of life. It is purely an Indian custom costing this poor Muslim country(Pakistan) heavily. Besides kite flying special arrangements are made to celebrate it. Rooftops are selected for this purpose on individual basis. People from far off assemble at specific places and dance to the beat of drum and sing songs like Chano ki aankh main kesa nasha hay and Patang baz sujna, raising various slogans. Special programmes are organized on conspicuous places in different cities on national level in which school boys and girls specially participate enthusiastically. No doubt, these places invite the divine wrath. Where modesty is wounded. On one side Kashmiri, Iraqi, Afghani  Muslims women; sisters, daughters are lamenting on their lost modesty and on the other these girls who are passing their lives in liberal circumstances, throw away their veil, uncovering their heads and bod! ies. It is amazing that the Cold Nuclear Bomb of Sonia Gandhi is functioning so rashly that in festivals like Basant, yellow wrappers and sexy songs, and the entertainment of kites &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&plusmn; all symbols of Hindu culture -- are seen all over the country. The Muslims should abdicate Indian culture. They should put their efforts in the establishment of a society which is based on sound footing of unity and faith to promote the Islamic culture.

  content: "a long comment, an excerpt from an abandoned novel, about basant in delhi...  Chhap
    tilak sab chhinni re mose naina mila ke . . . The words soaring upwards carried
    us into the sky. A brief visit to the windswept blue, circling with the buzzards,
    beyond the shallow domes rising over the huge bulk of the Jama'at Khana. A brief
    visit before we were brought back by the jostling of the crowd to the marble filigree
    screen she was tightly clutching with one hand. The screen around the mazaar of
    Hazrat Amir Khusrau Dehalvi; courtier to seven sultans, revered sufi and companion
    of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, foremost poet and virtual inventor of  Hindavi ;
    dead for nearly seven hundred years. A screen beyond which women were not permitted. Not
    surprising, considering the song was all about, in rather erotic metaphors, Khusrau's
    love for his guru Nizamuddin Auliya. If Khusrau forgot himself and found himself
    nearly drowned in a dyer's vat on looking into the eyes of Nizamuddin, he really
    didn't need, or want, women around.  Bal bal jaaon main tohre rangrejua&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&plusmn; All
    around us, the dyer&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s vat was much in
    evidence. Turbans, kerchiefs, dupattas in the hundreds freshly dyed in spring
    yellow, the colour of sarson fields stretching to the horizon when seen from a
    swiftly passing car on an open highway. We&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;d
    forgotten that it was Basant Panchami, and had never known that it was celebrated
    at Nizamuddin, so were in a beatific daze. One of the tall hatted, ledger bearing
    sajjadanashin, who can zero in on a bewildered expression (and relatively prosperous
    clothing) faster than a hovering chil spots playground lunchbox contents, swooped
    down upon us with the story.  Nizamuddin was once so grieved because of the
    passing away of his young nephew, that he withdrew himself completely from the
    world for a couple of months. Either he would lock himself inside a room, or when
    no one else was around to disturb his sorrow, he would sit by his nephew&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    grave. Khusrau, who could not bear with his absence any longer, started thinking
    of ways to brighten him up.  One day Khusrau met a few women on the road who
    were dressed up beautifully, singing and carrying colourful flowers. He asked
    them what they were up to. The women told him it was Basant Panchami, and they
    were taking the offering of Basant to their god. And of course, on Basant Panchami,
    the offerings are/were made to Kama, the god of love.  Khusrau found this very
    fascinating, and smiling he said, \"Well, my god needs an offering of Basant too.&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; Immediately,
    he dressed himself up like those women, took some mustard flowers and singing
    the same songs, started walking towards the graveyard where his pir would be sitting
    alone. Nizamuddin Aulia noticed some women coming towards him - he could not recognize
    Khusrau. And then, presumably as Nizamuddin was about to bawl them out for disturbing
    his reverie, he recognised Amir Khusrau, courtier to Sultans and his greatest
    fan, dressed in ghagra choli and carrying a basket of bright yellow mustard, he
    cracked up&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&plusmn; Main to piya se naina lada
    aayi re&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&plusmn;\n \n-\tYaar, said Angel with a tone
    of total awe, as tallhat went over to more amenable prey since Angel and I both
    pleaded broke-ness, Cross-dressing also? Khusrau to saccha lover tha! You should
    learn something from him!\nWe walked towards the mazaar of Nizamuddin Auliya where
    the qawwals were singing, and I had to keep brushing away the ittar waalas from
    my ears, behind which they insisted on sticking cotton swabs soaked in cheap reeking
    chemical ittar..."

  content: what should be stopped basant or people spending huge amount on smoking
    , cinema etc.the festival of basant is from no means waste of money this helps
    in bringing the money in circulation. the money comes out from the hands of rich
    people and this money is earned by poor people. as far as the comments about basant
    from our religious leaders so call mullahs say it is a hindu festival and it should
    not be celebrated but i want to say that many things in our country which should
    be actullay criticized by mullahas such as cable, films industry etc.and i was
    disappointed to see in a news paper some lawyer filed a suit against basant these
    selfish person gust want to be famous they want to show people that they are some
    thing

  content: "many Pakistanis and often many North Indians assume that cultural norms
    of Punjabis (and for North Indians aka Punjabis, Haryanvis, UP ites and himachal
    pardeshis) apply for rest of India. Well the news is they dont. Not only that
    many Pakistanis often hold out on the quaint memories(probably transferred by
    those of the elder generation) that Indian culture or even Indian Punjabi (or
    the Delhi and surrounding areas)is the same as in the 1940ties.  Not only is culture
    dynamic but also with the formation of different states different states have
    taken slightly different paths. While it is true that Basant as described in this
    is a important part of Punjabi culture and to some extent in UP elsewhere it is
    a different story.  Also not the link given for Indian Celebrations of Basant.
    If Sahiytya Academy is involved in anything you can be rest assured that it is
    a dying if not an already dead tradition."

  content: sorry to read comments such as by raana khan; i am still hopeful that he
    is a diminishing minority in this world. it is sad to see people blinded by bigotry
    of all kinds including religion. so what if basant has a hindu origin? practically
    all south asians have a hindu origin. we should be proud of who we are and where
    we came from, because that is the reality. we are brothers and sisters and basant,
    basakhi etc festivals help foster a spirit of friendship, not to mention the economic
    benefits it also brings. come lets open our hearts and minds!

  content: Basant is a festival to welcome the new year. During Basant days, the clear
    blue skies of Punjab are filled with the breath-taking color of the kites! From
    mid-January to mid march the clear blue skies of Pakistan, come alive with the
    cheerfulness and color of kites- which are in all shapes, sizes and colors. Kite
    flying is related with Vasant Panchami. It is also commonly known as Basant. Traditionally,
    on Basant children and women wear yellow. Basant signs the new beginning and the
    colorful kites in the sky are a statement of this joyous awakening. Thats a short
    and good description for Basant! Its better than raana khan's.

  content: "i was amazed when i typed basant history in google and i found out every
    one trying to portray it as a religio-social festival. a book named punjab under
    later mughals had described basant as an activity of hindus when one of the hindu
    blasphamed hazrat fatima r.a. and was sentenced to death by the then governer.
    the hindus then celeberated the audacity and courage of that man by flying kites
    and all. i dont know why are we muslims celeberate it? millions of rupees are
    spent on this so called spring occasion. to copy other nations is prohibited in
    islam as well as its a sign of weakness. in madina Prophet Mohammed pbuh was once
    reported of people celebrating a festival, so he strongly said that Allah S.W.T.
    has given us two festivals to enjoy; the eid ul fitr and eid ul adha. so when
    we have these two festivities why go for others?  specially when the daughter
    of our nation dr. afia is imprisoned far away, when we have kashmir all in blood,
    with people dying in palestine, iraq, afghanistan? why go too far? we have our
    country under drone attacks and we still celeberate basant  with a huge money
    wasted? it appears that we are dead, we have our feelings finished, thats why
    we cannot hear the cries of dr. afia, we cannot see kashmir and palestine burning."

    old cultural tradition of Punjab. Over the years, it gained an element of controversy

<p><img src="/img/basant.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6/>This week Lahore celebrates <i>Jashan-e Baharan</i> - Spring Celebration - or more popularly known as <i>Basant</i> - the Kite festival. Now "kites" may bring to your mind grassy hills, warm <a href="http://www.intothewind.com/">breezes</a>, little children running with plastic strings and boxed contraptions in the sky. Or it may bring to your mind <a href="http://www.chinakiteonline.com/">fantastically</a> shaped dragons and demon heads. Or maybe Ole' Franklin's <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/kite/index.htm">cheap</a> attempt for adrenalin. What <i>should</i> come to your mind upon hearing the word Basant is a wildly colorful festival that covers the skies of Lahore with swooping triangles and the streets of Lahore with gangs of <i>bow-kata</i> kids. On the family side, it is a great weekend when everyone dresses in mustard-hued fineries, climbs to the highest reachable point of their residences, puts on music and flies kites non-stop for 48 hours. On the professional circuit, it is a hard-core battle of skills and wits with fingers cut through to the bones and eyes squinted shut through years of kiting. On the dangerous side, it is a cut-throat (ok, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3018966.stm">literally</a>) world where children and adults engage in top-gun-style dog-fighting in the air with strings coated with glass [or plain metal] and chase the "defeated" kites through roads and alleys heeding no man or machine.</p>
<p>So, this week is Basant Week here at CM. A bit of history today. String preparation and type of kites tomorrow. Next, rules of engagement. And HOPEFULLY, some of my readers in Lahore and Karachi will take some pics and we can have those contributions as well. Yes, that is a mission, should you chose to accept it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/hist1.html">Han Hsin</a>, a Chinese General, supposedly used a kite to find enemies in 200 BC. Sounds dubious but I hereby request Jonathan Dresner's help. In any case, kite flying came out of China into India, Central Asia (and Europe). In India, we have references to kites in the fourth century <i>Panchatantra</i> tales, translated into the Arabic in <i>Kalila wa Dimna</i>. Kites found a sacred and recreational space in the Malay, Pacific Islands, Japan etc.  The Turkic and Mongolian influx into the Islamic world made kite-flying into a leisure activity from Cairo to Delhi by the 13th century. However, kite-flying was never a sport for the masses; it was for the indulgence of princes in their marble terraces [just like pigeons but I digress]. </p>
<p>Basant itself is a north-Indian celebration of Spring. The <i>Basant Pancami</i> festival was the a five day festival during the <i>Magh</i> month [Jan-Feb] when the fields are awash in mustard-seed flowers. and consisted of people dressing in mustard-color clothes and having a good time. This festival can be traced at least since the mid thirteenth century and here is a late, yet prototypical account, from the early 19th century by Mrs. Meer Hassan Ali [an Englishwoman married to an Indian noble]:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a festival observed at Lucknow called Bussund (spring-colour). I should remark here, that almost all the trees of India have perpetual foliage; as the season approaches for the new leaves to sprout, the young buds force off the old leaves; and when the trees are thus clothed in their first delicate foliage, there is a yellow tinge in the colour which is denominated Bussund (Spring). A day is appointed to be kept under this title, and then every one wears the Bussund colour; no one would be admitted at Court without this badge of the day. The elephants, horses and camels of the King, or of his nobles, are all ornamented with the same colour on their trappings. <br />The King holds a Court, gives a public breakfast, and exhibits sports with ferocious animals. The amusements of this day are chiefly confined to the Court: I have not observed much notice taken of it in private life.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, we can blame the Sufis for bringing the festival into the Muslim pantheon. By the Mughal period, Basant was a popular festival at the major Sufi <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/02/24/stories/2003022400640200.htm">shrines</a>. We have, for example, mentions of <i>Nizam Auliya ki Basant</i>, <i>Khwaja Bakhtiar Kaki ki Basant</i>, <i>Khusrau ki Basant</i>; festivals arranged around the shrines of these various sufi saints. Khusrau, the famous sufi-poet of the thirteenth century, even composed verses on Basant: </p>
<blockquote><p>Aaj basant mana lay suhagan, aaj basant mana lay/ <br />Anjan manjan kar piya mori, lambay neher laga lay/ <br />Tu kya sovay neend ki maasi, </p>
<p>so jaagay teray bhaag, suhaagun, Aaj basant mana lay&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&plusmn;..;/ <br />Oonchi naar kay oonchay chitvan, </p>
<p>ayso diyo hai banaaye/ <br />Shah Amir tuhay dekhan ko, nainon say naina milaaye, / <br />Suhaagun, aaj basant manaalay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Celebrate basant today, O bride, Celebrate basant today/ <br />Bring out your lotions,and decorate your long hair/ <br />Oh why are you the servant of sleep? Even your fate is wide awake, Celebrate basant today/ <br />O high lady with high looks, [...],  when the king looks at you, you meet his eyes,/ <br />O Bride, Celebrate basant today [bad translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>A typical celebration during the Mughal period would entail the devotees of the Sufi traveling to the shrine on Basant clad in yellow to offer garlands of yellow flowers and sing <i>qawwalis</i> all night long. Now THAT's a good time! </p>
<p>I mention the involvement of the Sufis in Basant history because the popular trope of religious leaders in modern Pakistan has been to denounce Basant as a Hindu celebration that needs to be stopped. You often read/hear nonsense such as <a href="http://www.albalagh.net/food_for_thought/basant.shtml">this</a>. Bah Humbug. </p>
<p>Lahore was an early and central city in the emergence of competitive kite-flying. I don't exactly know how or why kite-flying left the nobility and became a competitive sport for the masses in South Asia and neither do I know when it merged with the Basant festival [ok, i can find out but please]. Some conjecture is that it happened in late 18th to early 19th c period when Basant and the Mughal king's birthday landed on the same day.  Regardless, it became widely observed festival among Hindus and Muslims of North India and though the "spring" angle has dwindled in Pakistan, the "kite" aspect is more vigorous than <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/01/10/local12.htm">ever</a>. Actually, come to think of it, the "spring" angle is the "official" angle. Ha.</p>
