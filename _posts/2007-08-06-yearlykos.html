  content: "\"Edwards recounted that he met Musharraf and had a conversation during
    which Musharraf claimed that all of Pakistani children go to a Madrasa. Uff.\"
      I will never, ever, tire of saying that General Mush is milking the Islamic
    Peril Myth :) If it were up to him, he'd have every single Pakistani attending
    madrassas so that he can then turn around and tell his benefactors that he's the
    only hope.  On another note, I applaud you for making Obama supporters squirm
    in their seats.  \"In general, YearlyKos reminded me of all the tech conventions
    that I attend - white, middle-aged with suitable floral printed attire, and hair
    that defies treatments known to humanity.\"  Tell me about it! I've got
    opinions on the net movement (the American political blogosphere, \"netroots\"
    and so on) and the demographics of the people who are most actively engaged in
    it. If you could say more about/expand on your thoughts about the demographic
    profile of these folks and how that translates into politics (if it does at all),
    I'd be very interested in hearing it."

  content: "Farangi,  No bigotry here :)  What I meant to say is that
    according to whatever surveys/papers/research we have on the topic of blogosphere
    and political net movements (which actually makes up a small slice of internet
    activity, ie the number of people who reguarly read blogs is very small, and even
    smaller are the number of political bloggers), the political blogger profile indicates:  1.
    has had graduate education  2. earns above the median salary 3. tends to
    be more liberal, and though the blogosphere sector for radicals is comparatively
    smaller than the liberals, there seems to be more of a flourish of radical politics 4.
    is male, but that is changing with women catching up 5. is white, but others
    are making their own space  So when we are taking about netroots politics,
    the framing and discussion of issues tend to be translated by the writers...  And
    I was interested in what others had to say about this; but it may be going off
    topic."

  content: so edwards agrees wholeheartedly with obama, eh?  man, i was really beginning
    to _like_ this guy. and desi italiana, i totally agree with your take on musharraf.  he
    _has_ been milking the Islamic Peril Myth - Paki commentators have been saying
    this for a while.

  content: Oh my CMmers. I want <i>everybody</i>at the barbeque. Mostly because  Sepoy
    makes a kick-ass curry goat on the grill. It's a dish he calls "My Plans for Orientalism."
    Seriously, though. My comment was only in jest. I sometimes forget how broad CM's
    audience is these days, and not everyone knows that Sepoy and his brood, whom
    I often refer to in casual conversation, lovingly, as "you people," are sort of
    post-racial. Conversations on race among the family here at CM tend to be frank,
    and are had without a lot of hand-wringing or pussy-footing, esp. among those
    of us who know one another in real-life, and have had to dig each others nappy
    hair out of sink drains. This is where CM will part ways with traditional "libs."
    Farangi say <i>fuck</i> race consciousness, unless it gets us somewhere. And in
    this case, it was only supposed to get us chuckling until the next round is delivered.
    Onward!

  content: "Lapata:  \"Does separate but equal work for you, Farangi?\"  Cute
    :)  Seriously,though. I have been mulling this over. One of the great things
    about blogosphere is that if you want to talk about issues that are personal to
    you and discuss things from a certain standpoint, then you can. The bad thing
    about this is what Lapata says in jest (or maybe not)- that it can also allow
    people to group themselves in separate spheres,consolidate that, and rarely go
    beyond that. For example, if you look at the blogroll of some blogs, they might
    be \"community\" focused and what not. And though I try to read a wide variety,
    I don't regularly read, say, the KKK's website (sadly).  But think about
    the big name political blogs and political bloggers in this country...  Farangi:  \"Farangi
    say fuck race consciousness, unless it gets us somewhere. \"  I love you
    for saying that, and I wish I could say fuck race consciousness too. Except it's
    not so easy when people keep labeling you and MAKE YOU CONSCIOUS OF IT. As such,
    I would like to say- \"Fuck those who make me race conscious.\"  Let me
    give you real life examples. I have noticed as of late that everytime someone
    meets me initially or is getting to know me, Indian food will inevitably come
    up: \"Oh, I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE Indian food! And, like, I LOVE saag pUnIr!!!!!\" and
    \"I learned how to make CURRY-- how much CURRY POWDER do you put in your lentils?\"
    Some folks have taken to show me that they know about \"Indian traditions\" and
    \"Indian culture\" by discussing wedding saadis and crap they've read in books,
    gleaned from TV, or from whereever. And nowdays, for some reason, people keep
    assuming I'm Muslim (probably because I talk about Pakistan so often), and anytime
    any issues about Muslims and Islam come up, people will turn, look at me,and ask
    me for my opinion, then backtrack and ask me if I'm Muslim. And just yesterday,
    someone said, \"You're obviously Middle Eastern. From whereabouts? I LOVE FALAFEL.\"
    I ain't Middle Eastern, I'm originally from the East Coast, and I love falafel
    too, but I don't care that you love falafels.  At first I thought I was
    being sensitive and maybe reading this the wrong way. But then I asked myself
    whether I say, \"OH MY GOD, I LOVE APPLE PIE!!\" when I meet white folks for the
    first time, or during the introductory phase. Or, tell white folks how much I
    understand and love Thanksgiving. I never brag to new Arab acquaintances that
    I know what maqluba is, I know what goes into the making of muhammara, and that
    I know how to make hommus. I never jump up and down upon meeting a Mexican and
    squeal, \"Oh Lord, I LOVE GUACAMOLE AND BURRITOS!\"  Is this multiculturalism
    gone all wrong? Or maybe people are socially inept and can't find anything better
    to say?  Usually I'm gracious and will go ahead and make small talk with
    rubbish like this, but now I'm really irritated. The next time someone tries to
    show me that they know about \"Indian culture,\" or they mention naan just one
    more time, I will say, \"Do you want an effing prize for 'Most Informed in Indian
    Culture Award?!\"   Then, if you're a minority AND a woman, you have to
    contend with things like, \"You should really apply to Yale- you'd totally get
    in, because you're smart, a woman, AND a minority.\" Now, why would race and gender
    come up? And why would this person have to pull out the race and gender card?  You
    see where I am going with this...*  *In the interests of full disclosure,
    all of the experiences I am talking about is not from a young, \"uninformed\"
    cohort. All these people are in their early 30's, 40's, and 50'S. This is also
    San Francisco. We are also in the 21st century, year 2007. But you still come
    across this stuff."

    it''s an edited version of the previous post.'

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/08/dsc03631.JPG' alt='mypanel' />As billed, I was at the podium at 4:00, ready to change the discourse in our nation. Well, it may take a little more than that. I presented a rant-free version of the post below which tried to highlight the fallacies in Obama's argument. My co-panelists were Juan Cole - who gave a wonderfully off-the-cuff rundown of Dick Cheney's pathology and the Oil Connection, John Mearsheimer - who predicted an Apartheid state in Israel [sounded more of a statement of fact rather than a prediction, to me] and Dennis Perrin - who tried to make light of our current predicament, <a href="http://dennisperrin.blogspot.com/2007/08/kos-it-was-there.html">thankfully</a>!</p>
<p>I didn't get many questions but I didn't expect to. It was gratifying, however, that tons of people introduced themselves to me over the weekend, and told me how much they appreciated my remarks, asked what they could do to help. I had no good answers. The section of my remarks about the Lawyers was the best 'eye-opener'. Just the fact there is a middle-class, a professional middle-class in Pakistan was astounding to many. That this middle-class was out rioting in the streets for Justice was revelatory. One lawyer I spoke to said with a look of wonderment, "If a Lawyer picks up a rock...". Such is the state of our media that we don't even know that Pakistan has a middle class that shaves.</p>
<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/08/dsc03656.JPG' alt='pleaders' />Any warm glow dissipated at the Presidential Leadership forum where Bill Richardson and John Edwards wholeheartedly agreed with Barack Obama. Edwards recounted that he met Musharraf and had a conversation during which Musharraf claimed that all of Pakistani children go to a Madrasa. Uff. </p>
<p>I had some conversations with the Obama campaign and gave them the text of my remarks and my slides. Maybe something will come of that - but I doubt it. Obama does not seem too keen to realize his <a href="http://www.mlive.com/newsflash/politics/index.ssf?/base/politics-10/1186380893138850.xml&storylist=electionmi">mistake</a> at the moment - Let Them Burn Flags.</p>
<p>I attended both Clinton and Obama's smaller Q&As with the Kossacks. Hillary is quite the Presidential but Obama is very charismatic, quick on his feet, and has a great vibe about him. Impressive. </p>
<p>In general, YearlyKos reminded me of all the tech conventions that I attend - white, middle-aged with suitable floral printed attire, and hair that defies treatments known to humanity. Word is that they will change the name to Netroots Convention or something boring. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>I have a case of the Mondays which will only be cured when I settle in to watch Bourne Ultimatum later tonight. Do you know that Bourne's alter-ego is a professor of Asian Studies? Yes, think on that. </p>
