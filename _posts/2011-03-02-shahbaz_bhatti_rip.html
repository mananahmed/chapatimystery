  content: Suggesting that we're a nation full of mentally ill people is a little
    uncalled for, ableist language notwithstanding. Nevertheless, a wretched incident.
    What a mess we've made of this place.

  content: Its really unfortunate to see so called liberal are still silent.When they
    will wake up? After leaving the country to Taliban? Are there no student body
    in university, college who come to the street to protest this barbarism? At least
    for greater interest of world security.... God save this country.

  content: "http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/11/blasphemy-law-the-shape-of-things-to-come.html Today
    is the kind of day its OK to say a few things about the \"ideology of Pakistan\",
    the so-called secular &ldquo;father of Pakistan&rdquo;
    and his confused Uncle Mohammed Iqbal. While Islamic supremacism (upon which modern
    Islamist fascism is being built) has always been with us, its been ONE of the
    strands in Islamicate culture, not the only one or even the most dominant one.
    While Kafirstan was turned into Nuristan, its worth noting that it also stayed
    Kariristan for centuries. The evil was always there, but it was not always this
    big. Thanks partly to the two-nation theory and Allama Iqbal's
    visions of Islamic glory, it has grown in spectacular ways in the last century
    (modernization?) and Pakistan is at the center of it. There is a reason why the
    Jewish apostate Mohammed Asad settled in Pakistan (there is also a reason why
    his poco pomo son Talal Asad is now living in the West and making good bucks selling
    the usual stuff (http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/asad/), but that is another
    story), why the rabita al alamai al Islami (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_World_League)
    has had such a close relationship with Pakistan, why Pakistan is the world headquarters
    of Jihadism, and so on. Anyway, I am not saying Pakistan is unsalvageable.
    Its very hard to change borders in today's world, so I expect
    that Pakistan too will stay one country. Its also very hard to be a completely
    rogue state without oil and feed 200 million people, so the elite will find some
    way stay away from the most extreme features of Islamist fascism (which would
    mean avoiding things like attempting a thousand year Islamic Reich and taking
    yourself and the region through total war before the inevitable defeat). Unfortunately,
    that does not mean the state also has to protect minorities or keep the various
    mad dog militias under tight control. In fact, the way the dynamic has developed,
    the elite will be handsomely paid to keep the mad dogs limited to Pakistan, India
    and Afghanistan, and naturally they will make sure they dont do too god a job
    and lose their nuisance value in the process. A friend from the PPP has predicted
    that the current regime is the Weimar republic, to be followed by an Islamist
    Hitler, spectacular improvement in economy and &ldquo;law and order&rdquo;
    and marching in fancy uniforms, and then..total war&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;in that
    depressing order. I hope he is wrong&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;"

  content: "I guess that whole Talibothra thing just took a different turn, instead
    of a rag tag group of bearded fanatics occupying major cities, the invasion has
    become even more insidious. With the tacit approval of certain elites and government
    officials, the talibothra is destabilizing society one painful assassination at
    a time. The voting with the bullet strategy.   I guess its too bad mohammad
    bouzzazi didnt speak urdu...."

  content: "\"Weimar republic, to be followed by an Islamist Hitler\"  It is
    amazing that this is after WWI which was started by Britain in order to stop
    Germany from building  railway to Iraq. Germany was challenging Brits supremacy
    over Europe. Germany had the best technology including ammonium nitrate Taking
    that into account your theory don't make one bit of sense.  Your theory
    requires either US or China to want your above scenario. What is more likely
    is that US will be very angry with Pakistan after it pulls out of Afghanistan
    and will treat pakistan just like Vietnam after US left it which is to use
    World Bank and IMF as economic weapon. debt is very bad thing.  Liberals
    even that fascists one are not needed."

    is not the Weimar Republic and General Ahmed Shuja Pasha or any other savior will
    not be Hitler. But, with 200 nuclear bomb, its still possible to be a rather serious
    farce..."

  content: "It is still within living memory - heck not more than 3 or 4 years ago
    - that apparently well-meaning lefties would demand that 'root causes' be looked
    into whenever someone complained about a little terrorism. Said causes included
    poverty, illiteracy, foreign domination and a whole laundry list of ills that
    affect most of the world but doesn't always result in similar madness.   One
    doesn't hear about root causes so much any more."

<p>Woke up this morning, a day before my own trip to Lahore, to see the sad news that <a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Shahbaz-Bhatti,-a-Catholic,-is-the-new-minister-for-the-defense-of-minorities-13664.html">Shahbaz Bhatti</a>, a Member of Parliament for the PPP and the minister for minorities rights has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/02/pakistan-minister-shot-dead-islamabad">assassinated</a>. </p>
<p>The lunatics are running the asylum.</p>
