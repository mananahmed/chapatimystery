  content: "Thanks for the Deewaar book heads-up! Fave Hindi film of all time, and
    by far the best news of 2010 (which is also my comment on 2010). \r\n\r\nI look
    forward to the new extreme form of live-tweeting that you will pioneer whilst
    contemplating topics philological. Will there be video/podcast of your Dec.14
    public talk? Please let us know."

  content: "Vinay Lal's book, judging from the excerpt, should be an excellent read.
    I wonder if he was able to watch two much earlier films by Zia Sarhadi: Hum Log
    and Footpath. The first had a hugely cynical Balraj Sahni, and introduced a teenage
    Nutan, while the other had Dilip Kumar as the first angry man of the Bombay footpath.
    Neither, of course, was as 'red hot' as the latter Angry films. But the first's
    dialogs were very popular at one time, and both had excellent music. \r\nAre these
    films available now in any form? I'd love to see them again. Zia Sarhadi, I think,
    moved to Pakistan, but didn't do much work there. He certainly deserves a long
    article."

<p>Gentle Readers,</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I have been drowning in writing deadlines, some of which will trickle into consciousness here over the next year or so and I will delightfully point to this period of non-activity (seeming). In the meantime, some announcements:</p>
<p>A. <strong>I AM GOING TO CAIRO!!!</strong>. I will be there from Dec 4 thru Dec 16th - hanging out at the AUC - giving a public talk on Monday, the 14th at the Oriental Hall (!!). Everyone I know in Cairo must meet up. Use the comments below or email me etc.</p>
<p>1. Historian <a href="http://www.vinaylal.com/">Vinay Lal</a> (am a big fan!) has a book coming out this month that I really want (HINT to my Indian conspirators!), <em> Deewaar: The Footpath, the City and the Angry Young Man</em>. He has linked to it, and given us a taste of it, <a href="http://vinaylal.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/the-foothpath-and-the-skyscraper-the-pleasures-of-deewaar/">here</a>.</p>
<p>2. Vinay Lal was recently in Berlin for a conference called "What's Next: Postcolonialism?" or "Who got Next? Postcolonialism" or "Postcolonialism: What's next?". I am not entirely sure how that peach was sliced. The good news is that it has prompted Lal to embark on a (already) substantial engagement with postcolonial thought in a series,<em> The Politics of Culture and Knowledge after Postcolonialism: Nine Theses (and<a href="http://vinaylal.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/the-politics-of-culture-and-knowledge-after-postcolonialism-nine-theses-and-a-prologue/"> a Prologue</a>)</em>. You can read Thesis <a href="http://vinaylal.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/thesis-one-postcolonialism-never-mounted-an-effective-critique-of-history/">One</a> and <a href="http://vinaylal.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/thesis-two-postcolonialism-has-had-nothing-to-say-about-the-imperialism-of-categories/">Two</a>. Please await the remaindering or start the discussion now! Preferably the now!</p>
<p>3. There are some guest posts in the pipeline - they will come next week.</p>
<p>4. As Aaron puts it, "<a href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-&acirc;&euro;&oelig;to-destroy-this-invisible-government&acirc;&euro;/">the internet decid[ed] to stage woodstock at my blog</a>". Go read. Seriously.</p>
