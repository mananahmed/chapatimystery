  content: "\"But why, I remember a student asking me, destroy their sacred site at
    all?\"  The more apt question would be: why the hell care about something
    that happened fucking centuries of years ago?  It's much easier to fixate
    on something that might have happened hundreds of years ago. It's much harder
    to think about the current issues that plague the well being of every single Indian
    citizen. It's more difficult and it requires intelligence and rationale to come
    up with policies that will guarantee every Indian citizen potable water, sanitation,
    a roof over their heads,  and roti in their bellies. I'm Hindu, but frankly, I
    don't give a shit whether there was a mandir before, and if there was, whether
    someone destroyed it and built a masjid in lieu of that. Who cares. All conquerers-
    whether they were Muslim, Hindu, Christian, whatever- did crap like that in order
    to assert their supremacy.  Is building a mandir going to prop up the well being
    of every Indian? Will every Indian have pani to drink, roti to eat, have somewhere
    to go \"home\" to that isn't a freaking slum? Will they be able to live in a situation
    that isn't demeaning and dehumanizing? Will it stop the trafficking of young girls
    and boys? Will it stop prostitution? Will millions of people stop dying from AIDS?
    There's so much nasty shit going on right now in India. Just go the Bombay. Go
    to Bombay and see the disgusting practices that take place. But these folks who
    talk about the masjid/mosque don't give a crap. Not for them, these tangible realities
    that exist. No. They are going to talk about fucking Babur and what he did centuries
    ago. They will use this so that they will have an excuse to dress up as saffron
    clad hooligans and bash people, rubble, past historical events. Pathetically,
    for all their invectives against \"Muslims\" and how \"Islam is a fundamentalist
    religion,\" you'll see idiots with saffron face cloths which emulate Islamic militants.
    How's that for hypocrisy, illogic, and stupidity?  I'm come to believe that
    people who obsess with this masjid/mandir issue are people who are looking for
    a outlet to channel their anger and disillusions. It's easier to zero in on something
    that is so intangible and almost impossible to verify, because then you are not
    challenged to have any rationality and logic to sustain your positions.    Excuse
    my anger. I'm sick of and disgusted by the fact that  people have been forced
    to write books, spend energy, and direct attention on junk to beat back and challenge
    this masjid/mosque issue- a historical question mark that I feel provides no answers
    to the actual things that are taking place in India right now."

  content: "Sepoy:  \"The more apt question would be: why the hell care about

    that I meant that the student should have asked the more apt question, not you.  Just
    to clarify, by no means is my post above directed towards you.  My anger and frustration
    are directed towards those who have politicized the masjid/mandir issue, and the
    Hindutva movement in general, and how people have had to actually take the time
    to deconstruct their agendas in an effort to undermine this Hindu political project.
    Instead of spending time and energy on focusing on the other issues and providing
    possible solutions to those problems that I mentioned, they have created just
    one more problem to deal with: fundamentalism, state sponsored terrorism based
    on religious fundamentalism, and all the other implications that have been borne
    out of this  Hindutva project."

    So he needed to care, at the very least, for academic reasons.   And while
    I understand your frustration over the manipulation of faith and history for the
    sake of politics in India, I know of no peoples on this planet who do not share
    a collective [and often contested] memory of their pasts. And whether tribal,
    communal, national or otherwise, these memories are invariably based on narratives
    - historical, religious, etc. - that are eagerly manipulated by whomever and for
    whatever reason.   But when claims of historical truths are made on behalf
    of these memories and histories, it is the responsibility of the historians to
    step into the public debate and at least attempt to present a critical reading.
    And of course, teach."

    aspect of disposession in Muslim-Hindu violence in India?  Some time ago,
    I spent a bit of time studying the tragic relationship between whites and Native
    Americans in the Early National Period -- in particular, the political climate
    and events surrounding the Indian Removal Act.  It's both rather straightforward
    (avarice) and complicated.  Let's just say that it includes race, sectionalism,
    federalism, and religion as well as deeply-ingrained fear of the \"other.\"  (Sounds
    like the American Civil War, huh?)  But underneath all of it was the belief that
    the Christian God wanted whites to have the land."

    arose in a class on the history of South Asia - covering at least 4 centuries.
    So he needed to care, at the very least, for academic reasons. \"  I understand
    what you are saying, and I am sorry I used your post to lash out  and vent my
    own frustrations. However, what is so academic on asking \"why destroy a sacred
    site at all?\"   I can conjecture what might be the origins of an enquiry
    of this type, especially in the academic sphere. My response is: I don't care.
    I don't care whether a \"sacred\" site was destroyed or not. What I care about
    is why have millions of Indians- including people in my own family- have been
    forced to migrate. I care about how families have been torn apart. I care about
    the fact that most Indians do not have anything to eat, drink, or shit in.   Also,
    I do think there is a very fine line between the sacred and profane. This is why
    I take issue with the framing of the question: \"why destroy a sacred site?\"
    How \"sacred\" is it, and defined by whom? And how does that influence what we
    make of the situation? And how we percieve it and subsequently frame the discussion?  \"But
    when claims of historical truths are made on behalf of these memories and histories,
    it is the responsibility of the historians to step into the public debate and
    at least attempt to present a critical reading. And of course, teach.\"  Absolutely.
    And I'm ever grateful for people like you who step into that role.  I do
    realize that history and the study of history is important- and when political
    projects of this kind gain momentum, we need people who correct the historical
    claims made by people, especially when it is used to justify and advance certain
    moves. And I certainly don't want to undermine the work that people do.    \"I
    know of no peoples on this planet who do not share a collective [and often contested]
    memory of their pasts. \"   Again, I totally agree. And this is fine.  I
    know that history has a bearing on their present predicament- Palestine, for one,
    is an example of that. The creation of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh is another.
    Afghan refugees is another example. The effects of history of are directly tied
    to the present, and I totally understand that.  But whether a mandir existed
    centuries ago?"

  content: "Jeff:  \"Is there the same aspect of disposession in Muslim-Hindu
    violence in India?\"  Could you please expand on this? Because in the case
    of the Babri Masjid, I don't see how it is a fact of dispossession in actuality-
    the square footage of the masjid did not dispossess Hindus en masse. If you are
    talking about the symbolic \"dispossession\"-- which would depend on the subjective
    definition of a \"sacred\" site- than that's a whole other story."

    Basu ed. volume Unravelling the Nation - a conqueror would go after the existing
    king's temples for the same reason the existing king built those temples, to show
    his glory, as it were. This holds even for more secular monuments, of course.
    All over Cairo there are mosques and buildings that were stripped of all their
    stone or marble at some point to built a new mosque or monument for the new king's
    city. Good idea to make an American comparison though, you have to do that sometimes
    to get students to empathize rather than exoticize.  And yes, I tend to
    agree with Desi Italiana about the idiocy of obsessing about the Babri Masjid
    issue."

  content: "Sepoy says:  \"But, there an example stands: a sacred mountain blasted
    up to build a temple to our own nationalist gods - specifically to drive worshippers
    to that far-off land [promised to them natives]. \"  Jeff says:  \"Is
    there the same aspect of disposession in Muslim-Hindu violence in India?\"  Lapata
    says:  \"One wonders how many historic landmarks and monuments are not memorials
    of victory and erasure of previous occupants.\"   All of these comments
    are based on the assumption that there was actual \"dispossession\" and \"erasure
    of previous occupants\"  with the building of Babri Masjid.  Unwittingly,
    all have seemed to fall for the line that a masjid dispossessed and erased Hindus.
    This operates on the assumption that one little masjid wiped out Hindus.   It
    clearly did not. As far as I know, mass numbers of Hindus were NOT dispossessed
    or erased when Babur decided to erect a masjid. By placing an undue importance
    on its symbolic meanings (\"It was meant to represent the superiority of the conquerers,\"
    \"It symbolized the victory of whoever/whatever over this/that\"), you're conflating
    the actual facts, or viewing them under the lens of symbolism.  And a comparison
    to the American \"Christian God wanted the whites to have the land\" is not precisely
    and accurately pertinent to the issue in question. Why?  Anglo Saxons- who
    used religion to justify political, social  and economic objectives- actually
    succeeded in wiping out entire populations (Native American tribes), supplanted
    them with colonial settlers, and erected an entire nation/state upon that, what
    we now know as the United States.  If I have my Moghul history correct (and
    Sepoy can verify or refute this), there were Moghul rulers, but not a mass of
    colonial settlers that eventually dispossessed, displaced, and replaced the indigenous
    populations as in the case of the United States.  Furthermore, the Moghul
    empire- while it had several strongholds in various locations throughout its highly
    decentralized rule- never held an absolute monopoly and rule over the entire Indian
    subcontinent in one given period.   As a partial result, various populations
    had relative autonomy (again, depending on which region you are speaking about).
    \ If Moghuls were indeed carriers of the crescent and soldiers of Islam, the majority
    of the population wouldn't have remained Hindu. Meaning, there had to be tolerance,
    independence, and so on to a certain degree to even allow the majority of Hindus
    to not only practice their religion, but allow an expansion, renewal, and continuous
    development of Hindu mythology, writings, literature, music, and so on. The majority
    of the population- which was largely indigenous to its specific locations, such
    as Gujaratis, Punjabis, and so on- was left to grow.  None of this really
    happened in the US. So while I can see that there is a commonality in the usage
    of religion to secure certain political, social, and economic objectives that
    the US and India- and really, many other nation-states- put forth, I don't see
    how this helps explain the Babri masjid/mandir issue.  And then once the
    dynamics of that is all cleared up-- the \"symbolic\" as well as the actual realities
    and facts on the ground- perhaps we can figure out how we can use our explanations
    to enact and/or propose change to the phenomenon that we see taking place? Not
    only the Hindutva movement, but other issues I stated in my first response.   And
    BTW, though academia, writers, journalists, and so on have used the Babri masjid/mandir
    issue as the symbolic face of Hindutva (\"Babri masjid is where it all started,\"
    \"the explanation can be found at Babri masjid\"), they have glossed over the
    other more complex dynamics of the Hindutva movement. Of which Babri masjid/mandir
    is one of them. The Hindutva movement did not originate at Babri Masjid; and though
    it is one of the locations where contemporary Hindutvavadism has manifested itself
    and led to consequences such as the Bombay bombings,  it is far from the only
    place."

    the Muslim invaders destroyed Hindu temples and erected mosques on those sacred
    sites\"  \"I remember a student asking me, destroy their sacred site at
    all? \"  Sacredness is a value imposed onto something, it's not a given
    fact that stands by itself. It's highly interpretive. I will bet my University
    of Chicago student loans that the majority of Hindus did not look at Babri masjid
    as a \"sacred [Hindu] site\"  before the VHP, RSS, and other Hindutva goondas
    politicized it. If they did, they probably didn't think it was necessary to tear
    the masjid down. And most probably don't regard it like that now.  It's certainly
    regarded as \"sacred\" to the vocal minority that trumpets this day in and day
    out (amongst other proclamations).  Sepoy, you should sit this student down
    and tell him that his departure point is the wrong starting point. Tell him that
    when you ask a question with the idea that something is factually \"sacred,\"
    you're not getting to the root of the problem;  that you are going to frame the
    issue and answer on the basis of an assumption (that indeed it was a \"sacred\"
    site, and then the Muslims came and made it theirs, blah blah blah.) Send him
    to India to investigate on foot and in person the other concrete, tangible, very
    real problems that people face there. Tell him to talk to Indians about their
    daily realities.  Perhaps conduct a survey on how many Indians feel that Babri
    masjid is an important issue, that it's a sacred site, and whether it is absolutely
    essential to \"reclaim it\", and how much impact this is going to have on their
    daily lives.  And then ask him to put the Babri masjid/mandir into perspective
    (with hopefully not too much obscure academic jargon that often tells us less
    rather than more)."

    where the mosaics of Christ and the Virgin and assorted saints gaze up towards
    the Qur'anic calligraphy inside the dome.  And of course it, like several other
    Byzantine churches-cum-Ottoman mosques, is now a state museum: a forced convert
    to Kemalism.  What interests me most, though, is how some of these are never
    quite \"memorials of victory and erasure of previous occupants,\" because the
    erasure is incomplete.  Instead you have these accretions and admixtures, and
    end up with a hybrid testament that can be interpreted in so many different ways."

    either I wasn't being clear (totally possible), or you didn't read all of comments.
    My comments spoke to how the Hindutva had dangerously politicized such a moronic
    issue (IMO), that people now feel impelled to deconstruct it. That the Hindutvavadis
    find it easier to fixate on something centuries ago speaks volumes. I am not taking
    issue with the study of history, or with historians, as I made it clear in the
    second comment.  And this politicization of Babri Masjid then causes some
    folks to accord a higher significance then there is to it, and some tend to simply
    veer off into the netherlands of who knows what- ie searching how \"sacred\" something
    is, \"erasure of previous occupants,\" \"dispossession,\" etc why the Moghuls
    did it (if at all), and making flawed comparisons (and this is really where some
    academic discourses start to take on a life of their own and that then become
    so disconnected to what is going on). There was no \"erasure of previous occupants,\"
    \"dispossession,\" etc. What there was an erasure for any regard of human rights
    for the violence that followed afterwards.  \"i'd like
    to find out if there's a link, and i'd like
    to find out if this link can be used to prevent such a tragedy in future. academic
    - may be, real - may be.\"  I would like to see how often what goes on in
    conferences actually leaves the halls and out into the outer world. I'm not being
    snarky; I'm stating what is my observation. Of all of the very pretty sounding
    comments about \"sacredness of space\" and so on, I'm wondering how any of that
    can be used in a concrete manner.   \"and rem the real kashmiri pundits

    u shouldn't be exchanging these comments but should be doing something 'concrete'
    some other place.  the basic difference between our thinking is that i think
    all this is relevant today. u think anyone who's interested in temple destruction
    is an irrelevant hindutvawadi, but anyone studying the renaissance is an art connoisseur.
    That's very judgmental. And what's sacred
    — well that cuts both ways.  Indeed there are kashmiri
    muslims who are suffering. But they are not linked to the guru teghbadur incident,
    so I did not mention them to prove my point abt history. The reasons why pundits
    are suffering and why kashmiri muslims are suffering are different."

<p>A commercial was droning by, as I tried to watch the NBA game and tool around on the laptop. Something about Memorial Day tie-in at the local Jeep Wrangler dealer. I glanced up just in time to see a panoramic shot of <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cocoon/legacies/SD/200003524.html">Mt. Rushmore</a>. </p>
<p>It occured to me, in that moment, that I finally have a way of getting my students to understand that ever-thorny issue of temple destruction in South Asian history i.e. the Muslim invaders destroyed Hindu temples and erected mosques on those sacred sites. Historians have countered this incendiary claim in the Hindutva arsenal by pointing out that temple destruction was a common fact of medieval warfare and Hindu kings were just as prone to do it as Muslim ones. But why, I remember a student asking me, destroy their sacred site at all? He was rather insistent that all this temple destruction pointed to some natural urge in the Eastern mind which was all bent on being religious. I think I mumbled something about the Parthenon but made little headway. </p>
<p>But, there an example stands: a sacred mountain <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/rushmore_game.html">blasted up</a> to build a temple to our own nationalist gods - specifically to drive worshippers to that far-off land [<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/1868.html">promised to them natives</a>]. That should explain it.</p>
