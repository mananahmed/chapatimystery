    "something about going back home and then running in a jungle?"



    So, you're saying Mel's Apocalypto is a remake of Kaanch set in Mayan times?

<p>From the writing-directing-acting-webdesignin' duo, the Suhrwardy Brothers comes a Pakistani actioneer, <a href="http://kaanch.suhrwardybrothers.com">Kaanch</a>. I am unclear as to what <i>Kaanch</i> [crushed/broken glass] is about from the trailer  - something about going back home and then running in a jungle? - but, there you go, the fledgling independent cinema of Pakistan. </p>
<p>While Urdu cinema has been dying [dead?] for a while, it is very heartening to see indies take off in Karachi. Later this month, people can go check out the <a href="http://www.karafilmfest.com/">6th Karachi Film Festival</a> - I am curious about <i>Majagan</i> - a film about Bulleh Shah  - and <i>Honour and Shame</i>, about Mukhtaran Mai.</p>
