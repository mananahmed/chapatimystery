  content: "Since I am slightly involved in parts of the judging, and am Pakistani
    and therefore corrupt to the core, I am hoping to work out some deal with Lapata
    to get to her party!\r\n\r\nP.S. I too hate the voting thing because I think even
    one vote is too many for most people! :-)))\r\n\r\nP.P.S. Thanks for taking part!"

  content: "I am surprised that nothing by Annie Zaidi (Known Turf) is nominated.
    May be the lay out of her blog makes it difficult to locate old posts. See \r\nhttp://alchemistpoonam.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/book-review-known-turf-by-annie-zaidi/\r\nfor
    a review of a collection of essays by her from various places; some of them are
    from her blog I think but with no table of contents and indication of sources,
    it isdifficult to know."

<p><em>I have a BEEF with the ridiculous voting thing that 3QD has - one can only vote for one post (wha?!?). But I want you all to go vote for one of Lapata's amazing three post (I will be voting for the Stay at-Home Man).</em></p>
<p>The blogzine 3QuarksDaily Arts & Literature Prize has declared its voting season as <a href="http://bit.ly/fNieRY">open</a>! Five CM posts are there for your pickings, along with 200 other amazing pieces of writing. It has been a good year, looks like.</p>
<p>If Lapata wins, she promises to throw a party and invite only those who voted for her. So, vote for her, then email her your addresses.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
S</p>
<p>P.S. Lapata Sez:</p>
<p>For a trip down memory lane, here are the posts up for nomination:</p>

2. CM: <a href="http://bit.ly/bGRQq0">I am Bhains</a> (by Sepoy)<br />
