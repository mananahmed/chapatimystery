  content: "On my shelf at work and in front of my bed (not next to my bed as I have
    no nightstand):  1. Maximum City (I know, I know- I'm always like six years
    late with everything...there's a weird, reflexive mechanism that kicks in when
    books, CD's, performers, et al are really famous/big hit and I refuse to read/listen/watch.
    Then I'll pick it up years later when all the commotion is over).  2. A
    Fine Balance: It's in the third person point of view, which I don't like- I prefer
    reading books in the first person. But hey, I'll try this one.  3. A Portrait
    of India  4. The Writings of Eqbal Ahmad  5. Shahida  6. Tom
    Segev's 1967  7. John Pilger's Freedom Next Time  8. Robert Fisk's
    The Great War For Civilization: The Conquest of the Middle East  9. Urvashi
    Butalia's The Other Side of Silence (read it before, but want to re-read it)  10.
    Albert Hourani's The History of the Arab Peoples (read it, but want to re-read
    it because I like fantacizing about the past)  11. Nirad Chaudri's The Autobiography
    of an Unknown Indian  12. Another RK Narayan book that's not The Guide  13.
    Some Khushwant Singh  14. Suresh Joshi in Gujarati  15. Deepak Chopra
    (just kidding)  And a whole slew of books that have to do with economic
    hit men, the feminization of labor, the global service class, South Asia. Also,
    lots of authors and books that I've been trying to find porever, but can't find-
    unless I order it from Amazon.com, but I'm really frightened to use my debit card
    online."

    \ I thought the violence was gratuitous.  Did he really need to get shot at to
    cover that story in the way that he did cover it?  I felt I'd heard, seen, read
    it before...  And I wish the rat movie had been a musical.  Or silent."

  content: "The Barney Rubin piece is awesome, thanks.  And I look forward to reading
    yr review of the Irwin book.  &ldquo;Ratatouille, which should
    be a big hit at CM since it is all about becoming snotty and high-brow&rdquo;  &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;hahaha.
    \ Clearly must see it at once.  And hey, speaking of Winterbottom &amp;tc., I
    have been wondering if you have seen/are planning to see 'A
    Mighty Heart,' and if so, what you think of it.  A dear friend
    (born &amp; raised in Karachi, now resident in more pallid climes) watched it
    last week and had some interesting &amp; complex reactions.  I am still wavering
    about whether to go, but I did think 'Road to Guantanamo'
    was good, and I am also very fond of Irfan Khan."

  content: "I am determined not to see it - just the paperback version of her memoir
    featuring Angelina Jolie on the cover made my stomach turn. I think Asra Nomani's
    <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062201673.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">oped</a> in the WaPo mirrored most of my reservations. Adding
    to that, is the fact that I am really wary of Hollywood turning a buck on these
    living tragedies.   That aside, I am a HUGE fan of Irfaan Khan [you see
    him in Maqbool, right? and even in Namesake he was brilliant]. And I even like
    most of Winterbottom's stuff."

    really the emotional center of Namesake; I wasn't half as interested the Kal Penn
    stuff.  re: Khan, I also went (some months ago, in the company of bulleyah) to
    see him in 'The Warrior'; a strange film but also a very good performance."

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>Watched Transformers and found it all too snickerworthy. I just don't know how one can keep a straight face at the slo-mo shots, the flybys and the military hardware droolfest - especially after that brilliant sendup of Bay done in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/">Hot Fuzz</a>. I won't say I had high hopes but I was really looking forward to it. Oh well. Also saw Ratatouille, which should be a big hit at CM since it is all about becoming snotty and high-brow. Next up is Bourne Ultimatum. And while we are on the subject, here is fair warning that I have been watching HBO's <i>The Wire</i> non-stop for the last 3 months and I am obsessed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Milos Forman has made a movie about the <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-forman15jul15,0,3149017.story?coll=cl-movies">Goya and the long tail of the Spanish Inquisition</a>. It seems like everything in the past is now a thinly veiled comment on the present. As Borges declared "... past is no more than present memory . . ."
<li>As expected, the aftermath of Lal Masjid is apparent in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Pakistan.html?ex=1342065600&en=5e5d3a7ad84463d9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">northwest</a> of Pakistan. There have been very few noteworthy pieces in the news but I do recommend Nicholas Schmidle's <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2170251/">Farewell, My Jihadi Friend</a>. Related, and a little late in my reading queue is the action-packed reporting by Jon Lee Anderson in the NYer, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/09/070709fa_fact_anderson">The Taliban's Opium War</a>. While some of these threads are put into historical practice by Barnett Rubin's <a href="http://icga.blogspot.com/2007/07/pessoptimist-in-istanbul-will-bin-laden.html">The Pessoptimist in Instanbul: Will Bin Laden Win?</a> It is that proverbial must-read.
<li>Now, my first impulse after reading Hassan Fattah's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/world/middleeast/14doctors.html?em&ex=1184644800&en=3e7edf718bc65ee0&ei=5087%0A">Radicalism Among Muslim Professionals Worries Many</a> is to mock it without mercy. Just read that opening paragraph. Is he for real? The best and the brightest in the <i>Muslim world</i>? the pinnacle of their societies? Oh and "scientific rationalism" was supposed to have saved them? Is it the very same scientific rationalism that created every single weapon of terror known to man? Oh muslims use science badly? Really? Are you sure? I mean, can we go and look at some other bad uses of science? Nukes? Eugenics? Any of that? Or how about those rationally rabid anti-evolutionist scientists? They all good? There is actually a good story buried deep in there - but Fattah is way too unscientific and too irrational to find it. Oops. I mocked! Bad sepoy.
<li>William Deresiewicz's <a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/su07/love-deresiewicz.html">Love on Campus</a> proves that those who can't do, write about it. I kiiiid.[ht: Nakhaee]
<li>Robert Irwin's book has been sitting half read by my bed [its insane] but I recommend his look at the <a href="http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25335-2647261,00.html">real and fake paintings of the Orient</a> or should that have been worded as: Paintings of Real and Fake Orient?
<li>If Deborah Soloman married Robert Novak, would she become the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/magazine/15WWLN-Q4-t.html?ex=1342152000&en=1d911ad9e1dea9b7&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=r">princess of darkness</a>? Oh wait, she is already a queen!
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml">Century of the Self</a> is some good social history documentary about Freud, Bernays and mass-consumption. I have only watched the <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=8953172273825999151&hl=en">first</a> part on Google Video [<a href="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-678466363224520614&hl=en">second</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-6111922724894802811&hl=en">third</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1122532358497501036&hl=en">fourth</a>]. I love it when the internets can be used for educational purposes.
<li>And finally, on happier notes, I enjoyed this look at the <a href="http://www.economist.com/daily/diary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9432122#friday">soul of English cricket</a>. My dream was always to play county cricket. I had the chops. I coulda been good. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it.<br />
