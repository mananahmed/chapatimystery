  content: "The tent-hoarding by government officials sounds very plausible.  According
    to another report on AlertNet, Asma Jahangir was there as well: \"Asma Jahangir,
    chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, was also present at the
    scene. She told Human Rights Watch that, \"Tents are now the most important commodity
    in Kashmir. But they are being used for power and patronage by military and civilian
    authorities that control the territory. This needs to be sorted out immediately.\"\""

  content: 'In terms of earthquake aid priorities, there are two: helicopters and
    tents (that''s not to say that food and medicines are not key as well). Procuring
    the tents is a huge challenge but everyone is focused on  it. Persuading governments
    to assign helicopters is another matter. It is very frustrating that Pakistan
    hasn''t accepted India''s offer of helicopters. It has several hundred in its
    fleet.'

    I am not surprised by hoarding even though I have just read the same news as you.

    Misuse of power and influence, even in the time of crisis is very much ingrained in the South Asian pysche because of lack of transparency, and independent, investigative press (this is changing slowly though for better). Something like this would have even happened in India.

    \ Really, her story is amazing, and I am happy that Glamour is awarding her \"Woman
    of the Year.\"  If only every person had her strength, courage, and determination
    in times of adversity, this world would be a better place.  /end of sap"

<ul>
<li>Who is pysched about the WS? I am.
<li>Mukhtar Mai was on ABC News of the World last night [as I was standing in the Southwest C line {why do I _always_ get the C card?}]. I couldn't hear what they say. But, she is the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=1237950&page=1">Person of the Week</a>. They call her a beacon of hope. Rosa Parks Effect. You heard it here first.]
<li>Driving in NH and VT at night...you see a lot of Moose Crossing signs followed by giant patches of red on the highway. Not cool.
<li>This Hariri-Bush-Syria-UN thing is going to get <a href="http://angryarab.blogspot.com/2005/10/what-did-mehlis-know-and-how-did-he.html">ugly</a>.
<li>Accusations that Pakistan is hoarding <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1239581">tents</a>. I am rather skeptic. Anyone know more?
<li>Please to note: Yelling Dave Chappelle catchphrases in front of old Vermonters....not so good.
<li><b>1-0</b>! 3 to go.

<li>I have wondered this in silence - refusing to find out or read accounts - what <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/oct2005-daily/23-10-2005/editorial/col4.htm">happened</a> to Lake <a href="http://members.virtualtourist.com/vt/ps/eab23/0/">Saif al-Malook</a>, the mirror for divine beings, in the earthquake?
<li><a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/daily/oct-2005/23/index1.php">Two</a> <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1598627,00.html">accounts</a>.
<li>Live Free or Die. America's <a href="http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/whereweeat/stern_general.html">oldest</a> General store kicks ass, I must say. As does the Bear Patch Drive. The Kajamagaoago-whatever highway which wound up and around the <a href="http://www.visitwhitemountains.com/">White Mountains</a>. We passed Bretton Woods without irony. There was <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/05/10/9716.html">snow</a>! The no-sales-tax thing works because there is nothing to buy. I wanted a flat panel 40" LCD - I got a orange t-shirt instead.
<li><b>2-0!! I think I had a heart attack. What a game.</b></li>
<li>A simple walk around a city block can turn to HELL, when Wilma is in town.
<li>Why does everyone in Boston look familiar to me? Was I here in a previous incarnation? In which case, why don't I like it  more?
<li><b>3-0</b>. Ahem, do you have a spare broom?
</ul>
