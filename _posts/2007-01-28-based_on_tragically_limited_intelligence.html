  content: "Yadein is a song about loss, and that's primarily what we wanted to reflect
    in our video. Only we also chose to politicize traditional notions of loss (i.e.,
    the spurned lover writing poetry).   On one level 9/11was obviously an inherently
    political act.  And the powers that be have co-opted the tragedy and loss of these
    events as justifications for their own political agendas.  The mass media in North
    American has attempted, in their own way, to tell the human story of the obvious
    victims of this tragedy. But the popular media treatments of 9/11 also demonstrate
    the lamentable loss of something else: the stories and basic humanity of those
    involved in these events as the perpetrators. We feel that by failing to take
    account of the humanity of the perpetrators, we run three very dangerous risks.
    First, the diminishment or loss of our collective humanity, for in not recognizing
    the human element of such actions we dehumanize not just the perpetrators but
    also ourselves. Second, the prejudiced attribution of such acts not to humanized
    individuals but to an undefined collective 'other', thereby imputing guilt to
    entire social groups on the basis of nothing more than religion, garb or skin-colour
    etc. Third, if we don't try to recover the &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup2;hidden&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;
    humanity of the individuals involved in these events and fail to understand the
    stories, emotions and histories behind them, we will never be able to prevent
    such tragedies from happening again, or from occurring in the first place.    The
    video is not, nor is it meant to be, a strictly factual portrayal, but a symbolic
    one. Nor is it meant to depict a spurned lover; but rather someone leaving behind
    the kind of existing essential relationships that defines our interaction with
    the world and each other. But you take from it what you will.    In our
    opinion, any act of culture production comes with, for better or for worse, a
    measure of power to influence its &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup2;consumers&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;.
    As such, we chose to tell a story that we felt was important, rather than hack
    away crafting something involving a celibate monk painting on a mountain top.
    The video was primarily meant for consumption in the local pop-culture scene of
    cosmopolitan Pakistan, and operate as a challenge for a scene that is very self-consciously
    apolitical. Whether it will have any actual impact we can't really say.      There,
    hopefully now you have a better idea of what hell is wrong with us. Apologies
    for the long post.  In solidarity,   Falak  www.falak.ca  www.myspace.com/falaknation"

    am very sympathetic to that sentiment. I have my doubts, however, that the depiction
    in your video does that successfully.   Yet, thank you kindly for your comments.
    I wish you all the best and I do hope that it generates the convesation you intend
    in the self-consciously apolitical scene of cosmpolitan Pakistan."

    1) The math problems are intellectual apartheid. Solidarity!



    2)Except for telepathy or the Ouija board, I just don't know how these gentlemen propose to understand the hidden stories of these highjackers



    3)Seismic activity all over the world has been attributed to Adorno, Che, Marx and Quaid-e-Azam (RH) all rolling in their graves.

  content: "Hey, thanks for your comments too. We have doubts too about whether we
    were able to effectively communicate what we wanted to with the video. But we
    felt taking a kick at the can was better than remaining silent, especially when
    there is the potential of it leading to a broader conversation (does this qualify?).
    Hopefully, our next attempt will have better execution, and we look forward to
    experiencing your biting wit again.     Sadly, we don&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t
    know of too many historians, journalists, film-makers or concerned citizens who
    are occult adepts. So very uncreatively, we suggest that understanding the hijackers&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;
    stories can utilize the same methods applied to understand those of the nearly
    3000 victims of 9/11, or any other tragedy where the victims don&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t
    survive to convey their own narratives. If death extinguished historical investigation
    and insight we would be living in a truly shallow world. Lucky for us, history
    is more resilient than even Orwellian or Stalinesque attempts at purging all public
    records along with people. This is not to suggest that our video is a factual
    documentary, but as noted, it is only symbolic of the near absence of such investigation.
      And we truly are sorry to disturb Adorno, Marx and Che&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    slumber. But who knows, perhaps Adorno would even approve of the critical potential
    and unacceptability of the video. Ruffling Jinnah&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    conservative feathers, however, we&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;re
    a little bit less sorry about.    In solidarity,   Falak  www.falak.ca  www.myspace.com/falaknation"

  content: "Obliged. In the company of professional historians and theorists, I find
    it unbefitting to comment on the subject of narratives.   1)Not to keen
    about notions of \"collectiveness\"  2)I understand your POV; I am well
    aware of the \"otherization\" and the act of fitting the highjacker's image to
    the beaten, old trope of evil, evil men a la Nazis--though I do think that the
    execution was a little sloppy, which is to say, your clarifying comments here
    were more insightful than the video.  3)Good luck in your future endeavors!"

    winter days. We've realized that mixing: (1) a limited budget, (2) limited experience,

<p>Toronota based desi band, <a href="http://www.falak.ca/home.asp">Falak</a> - who think therefore they resist - want you to know that at least one of the 9/11 hijackers was just a spurned lover. In their video for the song, Yadain II - Memories II - the band rocks, 'how do I live after forgetting you?' while the hijacker gets ready. The video, with the disclaimer 'Based on Tragic Events' is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjuyX1n3PqI">here</a>.</p>
