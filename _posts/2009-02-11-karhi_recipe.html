  content: "Hmm, almost identical to my mom's recipe, the main difference being the
    use of heeng. Pasting mom's below (the sourness of the yogurt is key, you should
    try to leave it out for a full day or more).\r\n\r\nBeat half a cup of besan into
    half a litre of sour yogurt. Add a litre and a half of water and half a teaspoon
    \ of turmeric powder. Set aside.\r\n\r\nHeat a little oil in a kadhai. Add a scant
    quarter tsp hing (asafoetida) after heating the oil, then scant half tsp rai (mustard
    seeds), slightly more of fenugreek seeds, pinch of saunf (fennel seeds), a teaspoon
    of ginger garlic paste, 5 karipattas and lastly quarter tsp chili powder (or 2-3
    whole dried red chillies) and 2 tsp salt. Add dahi mix. Keep stirring till it
    stops boiling over (i.e. reaches a stable, gentle bubbling-boil) 15/20 minutes.
    Then leave it on low heat for another 30 minutes stirring occasionally till it
    reaches the desired consistency. Pakoras onion green chillies and dhaniya) can
    be made and put in at this stage.\r\nTarka: Heat a little oil/ghee in a pan, half
    a teaspoon of jeera( whole jeera and not powder), red chili powder and pour over
    the karhi in its serving bowl."
