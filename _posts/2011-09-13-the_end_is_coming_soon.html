  content: Would this include a discussion on Naimutallah Shah Wali's supposed prophecies?
    I am most interested in finding out if this Nostradamus of South Asia was indeed
    a real person or is just a figment of the imagination of Zaid Hamid.

  content: Wow! Shame you couldn't be here for the prayer-a-thon last month. I might
    just have to come down from Fort Worth for this talk, we'll see -- and by the
    way, Townes Van Zandt (glad you're a fan) is from FW. Along with Ornette Coleman
    and T Bone Burnett, he's one of the few cool people we can claim.

  content: Bhai, he may be from FW but dude did some quality time in Houston, including
    recording some of his best live albums. But, hey - far be it from me to give houston
    more credit than it is due...

<p><em><br />
The wind blows cold outside your door/it whispers words I've tried before<br />
But you don't hear me anymore/your pride's just too demanding<br />
The end is coming soon, it's plain/a warm bed just ain't worth the pain<br />
 </em>- Tower Song, Townes van Zandt</p>
<p>Two things I know about Houston - my Babu hails from that town and is known to cheer for the Astros. And that Townes Van Zandt <a href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2009/09/townes_van_zandts_lost_houston.php">came from Houston</a>. Ok, I guess, I listened to some DJ Screw a while ago. And I remember <a href="http://stereogum.com/3687/cop_hates_two_gallants/concert/">that thing</a> w/ Two Gallants. But seriously, that is absolutely it. </p>
<p>I am eager, very eager, to remedy this.</p>
<p>I will be giving a talk next Monday at Rice University - on the topic of Prophecy and end times and Pakistan. Do come and say hi!</p>
