    government and the security forces fail so miserably to provide security to the
    masses, and now, to themselves...  But there is simply no explicit, clear
    cut condemnation of the Taliban and the sectarian/extremist/jihadi organizations
    of all hues that roam free through our land... one way or the other, our people
    insist on dragging the US and India into the debate... there are plenty who are
    of the view that if the US were to just leave Afghanistan, these terrorists will
    simply pack up and go back home and be good family men who come back from work
    and play with their kids and eat dinner watching TV... unless what is best an
    ambivalent attitude towards the terrorists is not done away with, it must be concluded
    that our awaam is asleep..."

  content: "Wait for the \"foreign hand\" statements and hints about the enemies of
    Islam to start in 22 minutes (they must have started already in Pakistan). In
    fact, I can predict that Zaid Hamid will soon be on TV pointing out that this
    training site is only 10.34 miles from the Indian border, where 3123 soldiers
    of the 32nd Sikh regiment are stationed and the CO of that unit had mysteriously
    gone to attend his \"uncle's wedding\" in Kerala only 6 days ago (of course, we
    all know that Uncles never get married in March among the Brahmins of Kerala)...AT
    WHICH TIME 3 american tourists and one Israeli were seen bathing in the pool of
    the Sheraton hotel in Bangalore in Karnataka. He will then invite his viewers
    to draw their own conclusions. Being exceptionally well trained in solving these
    puzzles, many of his viewers will immediately draw the correct conclusions and
    one of them (a retired brigadier) will reveal that he had seen plans for exactly
    such a terrrorist strike when he went for a short course to Leavenworth 20 years
    ago (an occasion when he was also served alcohol by 3 young Puerto Rican beauties
    with Yiddish accents). Meanwhile, Ahmed Qureshi will present the history of \"false
    flag opeations\" in a special program on Waqt TV. I kid you not.  These attackers
    were trained to take on NATO and the Indian army; compared to those foes, this
    kind of training academy is a very soft target. Ideally, the so called government
    of Salman Taseer should have taken some precautions after the Sri Lankan attack
    (if not much earlier) but it seems that many poor people will have to die before
    our security installlations have the level of security that any ordinary Rashtriya
    Rifles camp seems to have in Kashmir. Of course, in Kashmir the army, its intelligence
    agencies and the various paramilitary organizations are fighting on the same side
    .. Sad. By the way, I hasten to add that I am in no way excluding the possibility
    that some intelligence agency has its moles in the militant ranks and pulled strings
    to get them to aim in this direction. But such conspiracies are attempted in all
    conflicts, usually with limited success. The \"root cause\" lies in training 50,000
    homicidal maniacs and teaching them how to set up such operations ...... and it
    wont go away unless someone (the ZPP may not be up to the job) is able to make
    a clean break on a \"pakistani\" basis and mobilize public opinion against these
    people. Having some corrupt functionaries do the job while pretending to fight
    someone else may not be good enough. On the other hand, once the state is lined
    up all on one side, then its power is not to be underestimated. The Pakistani
    islamists are no more motivated and are less popular than the Algerian variety
    and the Algerian army has managed to fight their militants...I still think our
    security services can fight our militants, at least in Punjab and Sindh but we
    need to get the army and its agencies all on board with the plan (whatever its
    details) AND FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS IS SO. That habitual liar
    Musharraf saying the ISI is fully on board doesnt cut the mustard. In these matters,
    justice doesnt just have to be done, it must be SEEN to be done. It may well be
    that the army is ALREADY fully committed to fighting the militants it created.
    But it sure as hell has not yet convinced the people of Pakistan that it is doing
    so....and without that conviction they are not going to get the people to step
    up and cooperate with the security agencies. Its a matter of credibility. If you
    had only 10% suspicion that the ISI was actually still cooperating with the militants,
    would you pick up that phone and stick your neck out by providing assistance to
    the agencies???"

    services taking these people on and people believing that this is what is being
    done, there has to be a sea change in public opinion actually demanding that these
    people be taken on... that is something that I feel is sorely missing... whenever
    there is visible action against these terrorists (nominal or otherwise, effective
    or otherwise), the common man, TV anchors with dubious political leanings and
    Charlie's Aunt all whine about killing "our own people" and how they wouldn't
    kill us if we didn't kill them and other such nonsense... unless this mentality
    changes, this war will not be won...

  content: "I dont think you should bracket Qazi sahib, Nawaz Sharif and Imran together.
    \ Qazi sahib may still have some hope that the islamic revolution will include
    him, but I am going to stick my neck out and say that he is NOT  in favor of the
    taliban types and actually fears them, but does not know how to condemn them while
    holding on to the dream of rule by the JI.  Nawaz Sharif is completely on \"OUR\"
    side. He will fight against these people better than Musharraf ever could. He
    will keep making Islamic noises, but just like you dont expect Christian democrats
    in Germany to be anti-christian, I dont know why we should expect PMLN to be \"anti-islam\"?
     Imran is the saddest case of the lot. He is just out of his depth and confused
    and that is sad because with the world cup and Shaukat Khanum he is the owner
    of two of the biggest positive achievements in our history. I wrote the following
    on my blog today (the context is easy enought to guess):  I am the last of
    the optimists. I know its a race against time, but I think the bulk of Pakistan
    can survive in its present form (for the next 10-20 years..who knows beyond that?
    professional forecasters and \"strategists\" may wish to think that far ahead
    but for most of us, 20 years is about the window in which we live and act).  certainly,
    Pakistani education has prepared a lot of people for the coming of the taliban.
    60 years ago no one in our village (including the poor moulvi, whose own literacy
    was borderline and who survived on handouts and had a social status somewhere
    between the cobbler and graveyard attendant) had any idea that they were supposed
    to be fighting for Allah's system of laws. Today, there are several young men
    in our village who can read Abdullah Azzam in translation and who are planning
    for the day when \"man's laws\" are overthrown and God's laws put in place (until
    then, some of them also carry out armed robberies on the side....the cause needs
    cash as well as ideas). They have written Allama Iqbal's verses on our mosque
    and a nearby village has its own madrassa with even more Allama Iqbal verse on
    the door. But still, thats a few people out of thousands.  Maybe I should not
    be an optimist, but I like to think i have empirical evidence, not just \"westoxicated\"
    or \"hinduana\" ideas. For example, (and this is only part of it, but its interesting)
    I am a member of 4 different email groups and I try to track what responses are
    being posted. It seems to me, most of the Punjabi middle class is NOT ready for
    islamic rule at this time. If anything, the emails I get from Karachi are more
    confused (more likely to blame unnamed \"foreign hands\" and worldwide conspiracy
    against Pakistan) but that may be because a lot of the people there are mohajirs
    (not just from India, but also from Punjab and Pakhtoonkhwa) and their situation
    is somewhat unique. But then, their leadership (MQM) moved on to their unique
    vision of secular, gangster-ruled Jinnahpur  long ago, it really doesnt matter
    if the average email artist is still peddling RAW conspiracy theories. So, exhibit
    A for me is the middle class: not ready for Lashkar e Tayaba to take over at this
    time. Exhibits B, C, D and so on will have to wait till i get some more time...  Of
    course, I could be wrong. In which case its short trousers and beards before the
    flight to lahore on an overpriced charter from dubai (its too much to expect direct
    flights in that situation).  Omar   --- On Mon, 3/30/09, peracelsus
    \ wrote: doc  This incident should leave no doubt in anyone's mind as
    to what is in the offing for Pakistan. People of Punjab has been ready since
    Zia's time to embrace Islam, I mean the purer version. Their prayers are being
    answered. That day is not far when you will start growing a beard a month before
    embarking on a plane bound for Lahore; make sure that you pull up your trousers
    well above the ankles. Actually, according to the latest trends, among the
    believers, the lower edge of your pants drops just below the knees, and a trouser
    or a shalwar is considered outdated among the looks conscious faithfuls; it
    is being replaced by a modified jelaaba that is much shorter than its original
    version. I can't wait to see Imran Khan in a beard of proper lenght, and the
    attire of a believer will make him look so handsome...oh my!  pashi"

    undermine Afghanistan is proven, while insurgency in Afghanistan feeds instability
    in Pakistan. The threat that al-Qaeda poses to the United States and our allies
    in Pakistan — including the possibility of extremists obtaining
    fissile material — is all too real. Without more effective
    action against these groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan will face continuing instability.\"   
    And  in Tandem President BHO says,  \"I want the American people to understand
    that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat-al Qaeda
    in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in
    the future. That is the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could
    not be more just.\"  Amazing how the timing of these attacks by \"Islamic
    Extremists\", \"Islamofascists\", \"Talibans\"   or whatever , helps advancing
    the above stated policy goals and manipulating the public opinion ( makes you
    wonder if they are on same team)."

  content: "There is a couple of ways Pakistan can address this problem. One is to
    emulate the Algerian model, which is basically \"kill em all\", ban beards, close
    mosques and then orchestrate horrific civilian massacres to blame it on the islamists.
    Not a bad strategy if you have the stomach for it. about 150,000 people died in
    algeria over this strategy. it would cost more paki lives seeing how the population
    is over a hundred million. A bloody option, but an option indeed  the saudi
    arabian option, which is a two fold strategy. One is to funnel the most radical
    fighters to iraq to fight the americans, while at the same time \"rehabilitating\"
    the islamists who attack inside saudia. Pakistan could conceivably do this. But
    Saudi Arabia has much more money and influence with the US. Pakistan has no leverage
    with the US. In addition, do they have the Islamic theology that saudia arabia
    has? Pakistan is much more of a receiver of ideologies rather than an exporter.
      The Israel option. Treat the NWFP like the west bank. Settlers, walls,
    id cards. Puppet govt.  Occasional raids. Problem is, pakistan is a big place,
    there are lots of ways to get in and out of regions. So it may not be good.   The
    Chechnya option: Total war. The one upside is that it would force the militants
    to fight in NWFP rather than in the middle of Lahore. The best defense is a good
    offense they say. The problem is that it might take a couple decades of heavy
    investment and bloodshed before a sustainable peace happens., if at all."

    Algerian and Chechen approaches... "kill 'em all" in a total, but focused and
    targeted, war, but don't ban beards (because I wear a goatee) or mosques unless
    they are affiliated with the culprits... if they are, it doesn't matter how we
    destroy them as long as we do, their civil rights be damned... they don't believe
    in civil rights anyway...

    As a concerned South Asian American of Pakistani origin, I just wanted to express
    my horror at this latest attack on Lahore. I think now is really the time for
    all of us to wake up and realize that the "war on terror" is not just America's
    war and getting rid of these elements of our society is in our own interests as
    well, if we want any sort of a future for Pakistan.

  content: "Actually, \"a lot\" of innocent people have not been killed in drone attacks.
    There was one attack in which a madressa was hit when many students were killed
    (not all of them \"innocent\", but some must have been) but since then the accuracy
    and intelligence seems to have improved a lot. Compared to conventional bombing
    (and compared to the number of civilians killed in Pak army shelling, which tends
    to be much more haphazard) the drones are remarkably accurate.  They are clearly
    a violation of sovereignty. But look at it this way: the US wanted to destroy
    certain jihadi networks that the Pak army wanted to maintain. Instead of launching
    war on Pakistan, the US has moved more subtly. They have tried (with some slow
    success) to fight the pak army's proxies while pretending the army is an ally.
    The Pak army has done exactly the same thing in reverse. The people being killed
    are in some sense pawns being sacrificed by the army in the interest of long term
    strategy. meanwhile, the US is fully aware of this, but is hoping that by gradually
    getting its own proxies into the Pakistani state apparatus and by mobilizing public
    opinion in Pakistan against the jihadis, they will force the army to dump them
    altogether. This is a nasty, two-faced war on both sides and innocents are being
    killed by BOTH sides. Meanwhile the true believer jihadis have an agenda of their
    own and are willing to fight the army all out if that becomes necessary...but
    even they are subtle and complex in their calculations. Thus, they are killing
    soft targets more than army people, hoping to convince the army to cooperate less
    with the US, or to force public opinion to turn against the US.........and so
    on."
