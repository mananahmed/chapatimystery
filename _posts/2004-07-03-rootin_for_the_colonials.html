    Sepoy,

    The Portuguese have left a cultural legacy in Goa - several Goan families carry Portuguese surnames.

    I think identification with the Portuguese is more a sign of confidence in Goa than a simple sucking up to ex-colonial masters.

    Yes, people can have multiple allegiances, to their country, religion, as Nitin mentioned - the cultural environment etc. Under the current situation (Portugal vs. Greece). The Goan people relate more to Portugal then to Greece. So they are supporting Portugal. Where is the question of not showing nationalism here?

    Also, you may consider them colonial, some people there consider India as colonial power. It is relative.

  content: Greece's qualifying match for the final was hardly a performance that would
    inspire confidence. More than the home advantage, Portugal has carried itself
    with a spirit not shown by any other team. I am usually rooting for the best team
    any given day. As much as I my heart is in my throat when Pakistan cricket team
    loses to anyone let alone to India, objective analysis should never leave your
    side and one must never grudge success if the winner has outwitted the opposition.
    I will even go a step further to say that Pakistan sports followers are a lot
    more objective and less prone to burning stadiums like the Indians as we do not
    let our passion or national pride get in the way of appreciating the sport which
    would explain the immense goodwill that the Indians got in Karachi which was a
    day now part of our recent history. Everytime India plays a tense match, the following
    day a couple of Indians die of cardiac arrest. The last time I read such a news
    for a Pakistan man losing his life was when Miandad hit the infamous six off Chetan
    Sharma at Sharjah.

    I don't know Nitin, if the portugese left THAT many descendants in Goa...I mean, the BBC article states that the it is the "winning" aspect of the Portugese team that has introduced them to many new fans to the cheering squad.
    Preetam: Sure, we all are multi-alligned in the world today. Colonies are now Colonial powers (um..U.S.) and all that. I am largely jesting in any case - if there is one curse of the c. 20th, it is this damn nationalism.
    Deevaan: I think you give too much credit to the Pakistani fan (leaving aside the just concluded series). YOU might be an appreciative lover of the game but the majority of people went through a different trauma when Pakistan lost to India in that semifinal. Or when Pakistan lost the final in 1999. And while heart attacks are hard to quantify, I do remember a <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/cricket/1999/world_cup/news/1999/06/22/pakistan_protest/" rel="nofollow">record destruction</a> of tv sets at the time.

    And guys...What about rootin for the Underdog?? I know it's a particularly American trait but COME ON. I want Greece to kick ass.

  content: I need to qualify/expand on my comment on the Pakistan fan because I agree
    with you about the fans venting frustration which is both human and healthy. What
    I mean to say is that Pakistani fans do appreciate a good performance by the opposition
    and what they definitely detest is complete capitulation and comprehensive defeat
    or atleast acceptance of defeat by Pakistan if there has been a complete failure.
    This is why the Karachi one-day against India was so great. Imagine 600+ runs
    scored on the same day. By far the best one-day every

<p><img src="/img/portugal.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>The Goans, in India, are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3861201.stm">going crazy</a> for Portugal in Euro 2004. First, I learn that Morocco was wildly cheering for <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/2004_06_13_bjulrich_archive.html#108723596083242406">France</a> and now the Goans. Granted that the Portugese were the most insipid of imperialists - they got to India before anyone else and they stayed longer than anyone else - with very little to show for their troubles. But, come on people! show some nationalist pride.<br />
It must be soccer that creates such madness as rooting for those that enslaved you. Level headed cricket fans would NEVER root for England. In fact, Pakistani viewers cheered for Aamir Khan's ragtag team of Indians against the British while watching <i>Lagaan</i>. So, maybe Soccer is the great unifer that cricket isn't?<br />
I don't care, I am rooting for Greece, and not just because Dani-O is in town. Plus, the Greeks need some good news before shit hits the fan next month.<br />
