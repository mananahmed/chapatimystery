  content: "outstanding blog - all i can say control anything in a 3rd world state
    and it creates road block into development.  I'm not for supporting porn but let
    the masses decide what they want not regulate - I was surprised to see the term
    \"blue movies\" with a proper defination - I'm probably one word up in my vocab
    after your blog - \ndown with censorship"

    New rules suggest:
    1. No closed cabins
    2. cabin walls max. 4ft
    3. Already implemented in Punjab by pervaiz elahi
    4. Safe - Porno free browsing ; any cafe caught excessing 'fahaaush' sites will be closed down.
    5. some other rules : but nothing about anti-govt sites.
    KSA net rules seems to be the best : 'block 'em all'

  content: Well,the internet cafe sex scandal has come and gone like a nightmare falling
    on our society.Lets say it was a rude awakening and installing the hidden cameras
    was in a way a blessing in disguise since had there been no cameras and no taped
    movies,the sinful acts would have continued even now and dozens of girls more
    would have lost their innocence and this would have gone on and gone. Thanks to
    those criminals who planted the hidden cameras,not only has their business come
    to an end for good but it has sent a wave of awareness all over the country and
    thats good. Having said that I have previously argued that internet cafes are
    a good place to spend time and more should be established but by obeying laws
    like no cabins and no closed doors etc etc. As i said this hurricane has already
    passed by.I doubt if anyone of you still remember what happened in UK in March
    1992.A couple of British-Pakistani girls living in Manchester,UK did a few strip
    shows in UK raising money.What they used to do was invite a select gathering of
    mostly Pakistanis in a rented house and did strip shows for them which usually
    ended in mild lesbian acts. Movies of their shows did a roaring business in Pakistan
    so much so that newspapers in Pakistan published front-page reports about the
    Pakistani girls belonging to well-off families in Punjab.Their parents later disowned
    them and cursed their daughters but the daughters went on doing their acts for
    a few more months untill it all subsided and no one knows what happened to them.
    So one hopes the storm has subsided and whenever one goses around that notrious
    neighbourhodd which played host to the sinful acts it reminds us of the days it
    happened

  content: I was impressed to see laws put into action by Etisalat in UAE.Not a single
    porn site can be accessed anywhere in UAE.If someone tries to access a porn site
    3 times and fails,Dubai police might come visit you....Hows that?

  content: well... wat can i say about this it is wrong what they did but the sad
    thing is 90% of muslim people are doing this just bcas they been seen in camera
    they r the bad one, who ever recorded that,i think doing tht such thing was disgusting,
    it sad bcas from that some gals are killed and sum kill thenselves they did get
    the chance for forgiveness from Allah, dont forget paopel make mistake wen u realise
    Allah does forgive, we all make gunah's dosent mein just bcas we dnt do that we
    r perfect, we other things wrng and we realise we ask forgiveness and change ourself,but
    it is sad most of them never had the chance i think we shud not think wat they
    did was wrong what we need to think is they never had chance to realise  in life
    for forgivness from Allah.

  content: Ironically, the net cafes have become a popular meeting point for couples
    desperately seeking sexual activity in this conservative Muslim country. A recent
    scandal in Pakistan involved young couples involved in sexual activity in a cafe
    in Rawalpindi. The owner secretly captured the couples in the act by a hidden
    camera, subsequently released the videos on a CD. He was later nabbed by the intelligence
    services and has never been seen since.

  content: "so the pakistani do gooders want to stop their youngsters having fun.anyone
    over 18 has the right to decide if porography is good or bad.  also trying
    to stop young men and women having a snog in the internet cafe cabins is unfair. 
    only poor working class or middle class people take advantage of such opportunities. 
    pakistani people do not seem to want to stop the rich and affluent from having
    sexual relations in high class hotels.  why do police only raid the cheaper
    hotels and catch the poorer members of society and torture them for illicit sex. 
    why have the police never raided the high class hotels.  are islamic laws and
    morality laws only applicable to working and middle class people.  what a sad
    society.has anyone wondered why the younger generation is disheartened with the
    situation they find themselves in.  as long as pakistan continues trying to
    be an islamic state that controls sexual conduct of the population,pakistan will
    remain on the scrap heap .a backward country that most certainly will remain backward
    and poor for the forseeable future.  unless sexual deprivation of the young
    is tackled pakistan will not progress. time for sexual liberation!"

<p><img src="/img/internetcafe.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>My most popular post seems to be this <a href="/archives/homistan/the_secret_lives_of_internet_cafes.html">one</a> which got posted on some desi chat rooms and now I get 50 hits a day from people looking to find pictures of some net cafe action. Not here, people. Nothing to see.<br />
I want to give an update that, according to today's <i>Daily Jang</i> <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/aug2004-daily/24-08-2004/editorial/editorial.htm">editorial</a>, the government is indeed passing regulation governing internet cafes in Pakistan. I translate:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">According to reports, it has been decided that a regulatory commission will be created to oversee and legislate Internet Cafes. For this purpose, a legislative act will soon be presented to the Cabinet. This decision was made in response to public outcry against pronography emanating from these cafes. The owners of such cafes will also be issued strict guidelines including removing all shaded windows in the cabins with clear glass, keeping a strict journal of cafe users and separate facilities for women.<br />
Reports have recently surfaced that these internet cafes are used to propogate pornography and seditious activity in the neighborhoods. Other reports have blamed the cafes as gathering places for anti-societal elements. Therefore, the decision by the goverment to stop such activities and monitor such establishments through a committee is a positive and welcome one. However, like many other issues, this should not be a cursory step - but these problems must be eradicated. The Internet is a modern and revolutionary medium of knowledge and our youth will undoubtedly learn from it but without proper supervision, it will become the source of many societal evils.<br />
Many nations of the world have taken similair steps but we haven't even managed to ban obscene websites here. Especially, to protect the young generation from character-deforming evils (uh, <i>ikhlaki buriaN</i>), the Government needs to take effective measures.<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>As pointed out at <i>KO</i>, the Pakistani State is quite industrious in <a href="http://ko.offroadpakistan.com/pakistan/2004_08/sa_tribune_blocked_again.html">banning anti-Musharraf sites</a>, and this step will further encroach any freedom of information in Pakistan. Because, make no mistake, this is not about whether internet cafes distribute porn. Trust me, porn is not hard to find in Pakistan whether it be of text or video variety. So, if "character-deforming evils" (my bad translation is growing on me) <b>were</b> the actual issue, we would have actions against the million pulp novel sellers in Old Anarkali and Liberty or the gazillion video/dvd stores storing <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20031003.html">Blue Movies</a>.<br />
The issue is that you cannot have freedom to access this bad wide world in a military dictatorship. You do as the <a href="http://muttawa.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_muttawa_archive.html#108576378904148461">Saudis do</a>, you ban all.<br />
These States are polishing the silver on the Titanic, as someone said.</p>
