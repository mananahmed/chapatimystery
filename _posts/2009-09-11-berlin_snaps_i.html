<p>I must say that this long hiatus has made me lose my blogging legs. Weird. It's like I have never done this before. As usual, instead of sitting down and writing a long, thoughtful piece on the art of staying in touch with my ghostly audience, I thought I'd upload some random pics I have taken in my week in Berlin. They might not be as good as that Lahore Snaps series but I will get better, as I get to know the city. </p>
