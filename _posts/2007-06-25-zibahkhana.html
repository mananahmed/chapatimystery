  content: 'on a side note: Khan has a nice little ice cream shop in Islamabad called
    "The Hot Spot" (get it?), and it is covered with artwork from Pakistani horror
    films of generations past. The guy seems like he''s obsessed...but their waffle
    with butter pecan ice cream is awesome.'

  content: "Netflix had a Pakistani horror film once upon a time (a Dracula-version),
    but I can't seem to find it anymore...Amazon.com has it, and from the title sounds
    like the Zinda Laash sepoy refers to:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Living-Corpse-Yasmine-IX/dp/B0002V7STI"

  content: Just so you know, Omar Khan, the Zibahkhana director, restored released
    Zinda Laash on DVD, the movie referred to earlier. There's a clear homage to it
    in Zibahkhana! It doesn't claim to be Pakistan's first horror film, it claims
    to be Pakistan's first contemporary horror film, something Maula Jutt can't really
    lay claim to! I hope you enjoy it, it's bloody good fun.

  content: "ZIBAHKHANA - HELL'S GROUND just won a Special Jury Award for the BEST
    GORE at the Fantastic Film Festival, Austin TX.\r\n\r\nZIBAHKHANA has been - after
    a long struggle due to the digital format of the film - been granted a screening
    for the Pakistani censors and if all goes according to plan, the film should be
    hitting the odd screen in Pakistan very soon indeed."

<p><img src='http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/zibahposter.jpg' alt='zibahposter.jpg' height='220'/>Omar Ali Khan - an aficionado and connoisseur of the weird and macabre lollywod/Punjabi cinema - has released his first directorial effort: <a href="http://www.zibahkhana.com/">Zibahkhana</a> [literally, Slaughterhouse]. I hope that it gets out on DVD etc. as well. Our ChiTrib recently had Kim Barker's report, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-letter_barkerjun13,1,877759.story?ctrack=2&cset=true">Zombies breathe life into film</a>, that I read and railed against [It is not Pakistan's first horror film and 'serious' is not how I would characterize any of Pakistani cinema and the 'slasher genre' reached Pakistan soundly by the time of <i>Wahshi Jatt</i> or the masterpiece <i>Maula Jatt</i>]. Oh well. I remember, as a teenager, watching this awesome horror movie called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PrASRxhmM4">Zinda Laash</a>/Living Dead] during some cricket tournament and yelling juggats at the tv screen [Also catch the Bollywood version - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1LCjhh123U">Bandh Darwaza</a>/Closed Door]. I hope Zibahkhana is as fun.</p>
