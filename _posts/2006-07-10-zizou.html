    The 14th inning stretch was brilliant.  I thought (in the 12th) that I'd try to wait 'til it was over to make dinner.  But the Wife and I got hungry, so we paused the game for a bit and came back for what hopefully be a quick Ortiz or Manny homer.  But no.



    And then TiVo buffer caught up with real time, and we had to sit through the commercials, and it just kept going and going.



    We had a chant, too.  "Go Cubs!"  But anyway . . .



    We almost invited you to a Cubs game in mid-June, but the tickets I thought I had bought for that game of our Midwest baseball tour turned out to be for April.  By the time I figured out my mistake, it was impossible to get even two seats together.



    The Cell was nice enough for a bastion of evil.  I had actually expected more rowdies given the neighborhood and lifelong Cubbies prejudices.  But no, just the same suburban families as every other park I've visited.  Well, except, Anaheim; there's a true slice of the community.

    was probably one of the most diverse teams in the competition.'

<p><img src="/img/zidanelib.jpg"/>France was my pick for a while - for all the non-soccer reasons like diversity and for soccer reasons like Zidane. Pdcs penned a wonderful <a href="http://www.landoflime.com/archives/not-cricket/in-praise-of-zinedine-zidane/">ballad</a> to Zizou, even, to hype the finals. </p>
<p>And then. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2slJ9CBnk0">the beginning</a> closely and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPKM5aJGW8">Materazzi</a>'s hand in <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=titty+twister">particular</a>. </p>
<p>Well, I am staying with Zidane. And, if there is any truth to <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&storyID=2006-07-10T163843Z_01_L10406204_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-FRANCE-ZIDANE.XML">this</a> than I will be playing <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/zidane.html">this</a> for a while [via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/07/allez-les-bleus">jkottke</a>]. </p>
<p>ps. Did you see the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/cs-060709soxgamer,1,3969247.story?coll=chi-sportsnew-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true">Soxfest</a>? 19 freakin' innings worth of baseball goodness? I even had a chant going [go, go, whitesox] in my living room. </p>
