  content: I think you forgot a link to <a href="http://www.badmash.org/dishoom.php"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.badmash.org/dishoom.php</a> ... I thought it was the
    most hilarious swf ever, but I've seen Sholay a hundred times.

  content: Thanks for the blog, it enables me to live the life and share the intellect
    of a person who feels just like me, yet so differently talented :-)

    desesperanto: thanks for the catch. Have u heard of this crazy plan to remake Sholay? What say ye?
    cheeni: thanks for appreciating. I don't know about the differently talented part, though. I could decipher the geek code without the glossary ;)

  content: "sepoy: hmm...you didn't even bother with the inline decoder did you, hmm...scary! Differently
    talented? Are you also a qualified bean counter then? :-) Your travels into
    the dark recesses of the sub-continent's history fascinate me. My formal education
    never took me too deep or accurately in any context of history, and I'm left to
    gather the missing subtext when possible.  My perception of history is, and
    I paraphrase Bruce Sterling here - \"History is a form of science fiction. The
    future is history that hasn't happened yet. History is the sensibility of one
    time, assessing another time, that it cannot possibly know.\" I'm entertained!"

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg" align=left hspace=22 vspace=6>Kavi had the 2nd birthday. Lots of two-years old getting funky with the cake. I did some partying of my own in Madison at some bar that had a giant fake tree in it for unexplained reasons. Here are a few things to keep you going through the Sunday night. </p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone is talking about the chilling <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html?position=&oref=login&pagewanted=print&position=">profile</a> of Our Fearless Leader in the NYT Magazine. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_10_01_juancole_archive.html#109800207975930055">Juan Cole</a> uses the piece to compare Bush to Mao. All I can say is, let's just get him out of the White House and worry about history later.
<li>Also from NYT, comes a fairly disturbing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/15/international/europe/15veil.html?ei=5090&en=e49583a226477b67&ex=1255579200&partner=your-registration-system-sucks&pagewanted=all&position=">image</a> about veiling. I think I know what I will be for Halloween.
<li>Over in <a href="http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_13146.shtml">Bangladesh</a>, there is some uproar on whether the Prophet was called a war-monger by a German historian, <a href="http://hans.kippenberg.uni-bremen.de/">Hans Kippenberg</a>. Same point came up in my class. Crazy historians, eh?
<li>Spencer laid down the law about another historian and controversy in Maharashtra. Here is a <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FJ09Df02.html">review</a> from Asia Times of James Laine's <i>Shiva Ji</i>. Prof. Laine cannot ever travel to India on account of charges brought up against him. Spencer kicked ass in his appraisal of the culpability of media and state against Laine.
<li>From the Guardian, a story about the rise in <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1322209,00.html">Rumi</a> appreciation in <i>Iran</i>. Why? Because Rumi is love and spirituality and  what the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1329329,00.html">fundamentalists</a> have to offer to Muslims ain't that. Speaking of Rumi: Hey! Dani! Can we get started on the book?
<li>Lastly, <a href="http://www.badmash.org/dishoom.php">this</a> will make a lot more sense if you have seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073707/">Sholay</a> or know who Amitabh is...still, it is a funny desi take on the presidential debates.
</ul>
