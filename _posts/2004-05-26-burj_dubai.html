    Impressive, but would it be a major target for international terrorists given UAE's pro-westren  stance and huge number of foreigners living there ?
    Why go so high anyway ?

<p><img src="/img/tower.jpg" align=left hspace=6>The Chicago Tribune [r.r] today reported that a Chicago architectural firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill who also designed the Hancock Building and the Sears Tower, has designed a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0405260249may26,1,474582.story?coll=chi-news-hed">2000 feet skyscraper</a> in the UAE - to be build by the <a href="http://www.saudichambers.org.sa/page.asp?s_contentid=55732&tid=4&cid=203">Saudi Binladen Group</a>. It will be called Burj Dubai (Dubai Tower).The realty group, Emaar, has much more <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/projects_burjdubai.html">info</a>on their website which touts the world's biggest mall and somesuch. Looks impressive and, uh, unnecessary. But then, I hate malls.<br />
I have to admit that Dubai will be one of the most architecturally impressive cities in the world. I love the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&q=burj+al+arab&btnG=Search">Burj AlArab</a>. Anyways, BigUp to Chicago firm.</p>
