    We're looking for banners to put on collection booths. Thanks a LOT for your posters. They really helped. Please write about your efforts in your area / institution at the wiki (it's temporarily having problems because of a surge in web accesses because of an article on the server about increasing ipod nano storage capacity to 200gb):

  content: "sepoy-- glad to hear that your family is safe.  i dearly hope that the
    people you write about here are, as well.  i'm remembering the photos a lahori
    friend once showed me of family vacations to the NWFP, and am terribly saddened.
    \ \n\nin addition to raising money for relief efforts, once the urgent need has
    passed, it would be a very good thing if more attention could be focused on the
    \ need for prevention efforts-- the work of groups like this one: <a href=\"http://www.geohaz.org/\"

    <strong>No Burial For Balakot.</strong>

    Pervez Hoodbhoy wrote an article about his trip to Balakot on Chowk, below is an excerpt from it: The clock is ticking. In barely two months from now, the mountains will get their first snowfall and temperatures will plummet below...

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/earthquakeposter_vtmbjpg">It was the summer of our junior year in high school. Khayyam, Sohail, Reza and I went to Mansera and beyond for a hiking trip. Our host in Mansera was Bilawal. His house was one of the many in lanes [galli] that dotted the mountain side. Thin strips of mountain rock led from the main road up to his house. Beneath the wide chasm. The jokes were that us fools will come out in the night and take a wrong step into the darkness below. We went fishing in the coolest, clearest river I had ever seen. And by fishing, I mean, we packed some gunpowder in a small bread ball with a long fuse and dropped it in the river. It was my first time alone in the mountains. I went many times after. Much further into the ranges with many, many fond memories.  I keep remembering Bilawal's face. Not his face in person but his face in a picture that was taken and that I haven't seen since. Isn't that funny? This trick of memory. In the picture, all four of us are "striking a pose" with our jeans rolled tight at the cuff and our high-top Reeboks puffed high. I think my tshirt collar was up. I have no idea if Bilawal or his family are alive.</p>
<p>I have been looking at the earthquake pictures at Getty Images. I keep wanting to cry but I keep reminding myself that crying is so not going to help - and, besides, it will severely wreck my cool, calm exterior. So, must do something.</p>
<p>In case you are having some fundraising at your place of business or school, I have made a high-res poster that you can get printed at whatever size you desire at your local kinko's etc. [<a href="/img/earthquakeposter.pdf">pdf</a> and <a href="/img/earthquakeposter.jpg">jpg</a>]. Beware this is a big image. If you want a web-sized one, click <a href="/img/earthquakeposter_small.jpg">here</a>. If you want a flyer size, click <a href="/img/earthquakeflyer.jpg">here</a>. For an even smaller version, click <a href="/img/earthquakeposter_tmb.jpg">here</a>. Feel free to download them, distribute them, print them, use them. I will make some banners and buttons too, if anyone says the word.</p>
<p>Now, there are three venues for online donation:</p>
<p>1. There is now a direct link to <a href="https://american.redcross.org/site/Donation?ACTION=SHOW_DONATION_OPTIONS&CAMPAIGN_ID=3361">American Red Cross for Earthquake relief</a> [hat tip Rajiv Vrudhula!]</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.developpakistan.org/Default.aspx?tabid=149">ADP</a> who have raised over $50,000 for Edhi Foundation.</p>
