  content: There have been a lot of 'moving accounts' about Faisal Shahzad and Ajmal
    Kasab in some quarters. It's a curious phenomenon. ;-)

  content: "Its not curious at all.  Imagine people who are intelligent enough to
    write well and who want the world to change. They also think they know who the
    enemy resisting their preferrred change really is (USA, colonialism, \"postcolonial-fill
    in the blanks\"). Ajmal Kasab and Faisal Shahzad took up arms to change the world
    and attacked the main enemy (or enemies...India being a postcolonial elitist  state
    or whatever).  And they were \"poor people\" (really poor in the case of Kasab,
    psychologically poor in the case of Faisal since colonial and postcolonial XYZ
    had robbed him of his agency and his self respect). Their chosen method was crude
    and their targets a bit too broad (probably in part because postcolonial ZZZ had
    robbed them of a culturally-based authentic education, so they didnt know any
    better).  But what self-respecting intellectual can ignore the justness of their
    cause? Or the terrible privations that led them to chose to kill civilians indiscriminately?
    And of course, as Chairman Mao said, you cannot make an omelette without breaking
    eggs.  Some sympathy is natural.  The rest is details....\r\nOf course, I am being
    facetious, but only partly so."

  content: "Omar, that was brilliant. :-)\r\n\r\nIn comparison, I am going to sound
    like a complete wonk but to state the blindingly obvious: Shahzad grew up in an
    atmosphere of feudal privilege most of his leftwing sympathisers can only dream
    about. He came to America thanks to this accident of privilege not by struggling
    through GRE exams by the light of midnight oil. He seems to have suffered no discrimination
    - at least none that your average illegal immigrant would recognize as such. Despite
    this he tried something which if - thanks to his stupidity - had not failed would
    have killed/maimed/widowed/orphaned people including some who - unlike his apologists
    - actually know what privation is."

  content: "Ajit and Omar\r\nI guess you both have a point.\r\nI consider Bruce Fein
    as one of brilliant American . Here is his take on FS situition from an American's
    perspective.\r\n\r\n<i>The colloquy of convicted Times Square car bomber Faisal
    Shahzad with United States District Judge Miriam Cederbaum speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nShe
    challenged Shahzad's self-description as a Muslim soldier because his contemplated
    violence targeted civilians, \"Did you look around to see who they were?\" \r\n\r\n\"Well,
    the people select the government,\" Shahzad retorted. \"We consider them all the
    same. The drones, when they hit ...\"\r\n\r\nCedarbaum interrupted: \"Including
    the children?\"\r\n\r\nShahzad countered: \"Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan
    and Iraq, they don't see children, they don't see anybody. They kill women, children,
    they kill everybody. It's a war, and in war, they kill people. They're killing
    all Muslims.\" \r\n\r\nLater, he added: \"I am part of the answer to the U.S.
    terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people. And, on behalf of that,
    I'm avenging the attack. Living in the United States, Americans only care about
    their own people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world
    when they die.\"</i>\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Fein continues;\r\n\r\n \"The United States
    should have anticipated the predator drone blow-back. The 1770 Boston Massacre
    occasioned but five American deaths, but engendered colonial hatred of the British
    that cascaded throughout the colonies. Thomas Paine's heralded pamphlet Common
    Sense, a figurative battering ram for the colonists during the Revolutionary War,
    scorned reconciliation with Britain after their scorched earth warfare: \r\n\r\n<i>The
    Men of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offenses of Britain, and,
    still hoping for the best, are apt to call out, 'Come, come, we shall be friends
    again, for all this.' But examine the passion and feelings of mankind, Bring the
    doctrine of reconciliation to the touchstone of nature, and then tell me, whether
    you can hereafter love, honor, and faithfully serve the power that hath carried
    fire and sword into your land? If you cannot do all these, then are you only deceiving
    yourselves, and by your delay bringing ruin upon posterity...But if you say, you
    can still pass the violations over, then I ask, Hath your house been burnt? Hath
    your property been destroyed before your face? Are your wife and children destitute
    of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent or child by their
    hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor? If you have not, then you
    are not a judge of those who have. But if you have, and still can shake hands
    with the murderers, then you are unworthy of the name of husband, father, friend,
    or lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of
    a coward, and the spirit of a sycophant. </i>\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/predator-drones-bin-laden_b_744061.html"

    I anticipate a rash of links to media articles claiming that in fact most of their
    victims are civilians. But as an authentic agent of the elders of Zion, i assure
    you they are wrong. The targeting is very very accurate. That you choose to believe
    otherwise is something I cannot do anything about...

    provide awesome policing, and a humane way to execute criminals and terrorists.
    \ \r\n\r\nAjit: If he had suffered discrimination, would that have mattered. Wouldn't
    a piece that highlights that discrimination be brushed off as terrorist-sympathizing
    or left-wing poco bs? By that logic, writers should only write to make the readers
    feel better about themselves by painting the perp as an inhuman monster that they
    can condemn and move on, and by presenting the terrorist act as the only salient
    fact of his/her life.  Add a generous dose of epithets - like radical, extremist,
    Taliban, Pakistani, Muslim, Terrorist, all basically printable versions of swear
    words like shit head and what not - to the outrage, and voila. The readers feel
    good about themselves, that they have expressed outrage and condemned the act.
    They have had their fill of the outrage/news porn. They have done their part and
    can now go watch that new movie that came out. Outrage, while has a purpose, is
    not reflection or analysis."

  content: "Akbar, my house hath not burnt down, nay. But this is immaterial. I have
    great sympathy for you if your house has burned down. I will march in rallies
    to protest the injustice done to you. However, I will not let *my* house be burned
    down by someone who has himself been wronged (by someone else) - let alone by
    a pretender who claims to speak in his name. And I will not speak on behalf of
    those who seek such neanderthal justice nor have anyh regard for those who defend
    them.\r\n\r\nTo draw your attention to the moral issues involved, let me remind
    you of an identical situation. In February 2002, a train was torched in Godhra,
    India in the course of being attacked by some people, resulting in a host of people
    being burnt alive. Subsequently, some *other* people sought retribution by butchering
    *some completely unrelated* set of  innocent people. Should I now keep harping
    on the first act of injustice and demand sympathy on behalf of the criminals who
    did the latter ?\r\n\r\nThe 'curious phenomenon' I mentioned in my first comment
    is that almost everyone I know sees the nastiness in this latter event. Yet many
    apparently sane people do not see the analogy when they speak of Shahzad and Kasab."

    I do not think me or Bruce Fein that I quoted in this case are apologising for
    FS phenomenon or condoning it.\r\nWhat we are doing is instead of assigning motives
    to FS and Judging him, letting him speak for himself and then with a cool and
    calm head analyse whether US foreign policy has any role(I do not blame it in
    entirety) in this curious phenomenon of ever expanding pool of \"Jihadis\".\r\nAs
    the poet said \"Dard Bahrta gia joon joon dawa ki\".\r\nHere Glen Greenwald has
    put very nicely\r\n\r\n\"Our national foreign policy seems boiled down to this
    premise:  we must and will continue to bomb, invade and control Muslim countries
    until they stop wanting to attack and bomb us or, at least, are unable to continue
    to do so.  Obviously, though, if we continue to engage in that behavior, that
    day will never come, given that this behavior is precisely what fuels most of
    it.  Just ask them and they'll be more than happy to explain it, as Faisal Shahzad
    has spent months attempting to do.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/06/terrorism/index.html\r\n\r\nAnd
    here are excerpts from  a report from Actual experts at Pentagon\r\n\r\nOffice
    of the Secretary of Defense\r\n3140 Defense Pentagon\r\nWashington, DC 20301-3140\r\n\r\n23
    Sep 2004\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM FOR ACTING UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (ACQUISITION,
    TECHNOLOGY &amp; LOGISTICS)\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: Final Report of the Defense Science
    Board (DSB) Task Force on Strategic Communication\r\n\r\n\"............................\r\n......................\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent;
    Muslims do not &ldquo;hate our freedom,&rdquo; but rather,
    they hate our policies. The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what
    they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights,
    and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see
    as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf
    states.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent; Thus when American public diplomacy
    talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than
    self-serving hypocrisy. Moreover, saying that &ldquo;freedom is the
    future of the Middle East&rdquo; is seen as patronizing, suggesting
    that Arabs are like the enslaved peoples of the old Communist World &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    but Muslims do not feel this way: they feel oppressed, but not enslaved.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent;
    Furthermore, in the eyes of Muslims, American occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq
    has not led to democracy there, but only more chaos and suffering. U.S. actions
    appear in contrast to be motivated by ulterior motives, and deliberately controlled
    in order to best serve American national interests at the expense of truly Muslim
    selfdetermination.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent; Therefore, the dramatic
    narrative since 9/11 has essentially borne out the entire radical Islamist bill
    of particulars. American actions and the flow of events have elevated the authority
    of the Jihadi insurgents and tended to ratify their legitimacy among Muslims.
    Fighting groups portray themselves as the true defenders of an Ummah (the entire
    Muslim community) invaded and under attack &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; to broad public
    support.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent; What was a marginal network
    is now an Ummah-wide movement of fighting groups. Not only has there been a proliferation
    of &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; groups: the unifying context
    of a shared cause creates a sense of affiliation across the many cultural and
    sectarian boundaries that divide Islam.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&cent;&acirc;&euro;&cent;
    Finally, Muslims see Americans as strangely narcissistic &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    namely, that the war is all about us. As the Muslims see it, everything about
    the war is &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; for Americans &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; really no more
    than an extension of American domestic politics and its great game. This perception
    is of course necessarily heightened by election-year atmospherics, but nonetheless
    sustains their impression that when Americans talk to Muslims they are really
    just talking to themselves.\r\nThus the critical problem in American public diplomacy
    directed toward the Muslim World is not one of &ldquo;dissemination
    of information,&rdquo; or even one of crafting and delivering the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
    message. Rather, it is a fundamental problem of credibility. Simply, there is
    none &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the United States today is without a working channel
    of communication to the world of Muslims and of Islam.\"\r\n\r\n- - Office of
    the Secretary of Defense, 23 Sep 2004\r\nhttp://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2004-09-Strategic_Communication.pdf"

  content: "Salman, \r\nI made no comment about whether drones are good or bad, just
    that they are very accurate and kill very few civilians, so those claiming that
    hundreds or even thousands of civilians are dying at the hands of the drones are
    misinformed. \r\nPersonally, I do not see any reason to use drones within the
    US. The state has a pretty good grip over the US (some would say \"too good a
    grip\")  and there is no need to use drones when your local police department
    can arrest the accused.\r\nPersonally, I am also in favor of using drones to hunt
    down terrorists in FATA because I think the alternative is a Pak army operation
    and if you want you can see video of Orakzai on youtube and see what is the more
    indiscriminate and crude instrument of war. There IS a war on. Of course, another
    alternative (and there can be many alternatives, not just two) is to hand FATA
    over to the Islamic Emirate and let them negotiate their modus vivendi with Afghanistan.
    I think that may be the most morally sound alternative, but Pakistani nationalists
    may not like it. \r\nCertainly Faisal Shahzad and fellow morons were incited by
    American military action and policies abroad. But the question still remains if
    their response was a good response or a bad one? I am incited to some anger by
    the drug war in the US. If I blow myself up in Chicago tomorrow, should we discuss
    stopping the drug war or dismiss my response as an asinine and stupid response
    which is not going to make anything better and killed several innocents in the
    process. Trying to \"understand\" my problem is hardly the first response to that
    stupid action."

    history of this conflict started . So one may chose to start it with ANY suicide
    attck or may like to start it with what the Defence Reviw Board called \"USA's
    self serving Hypocrisy\" and perceived\" oppression of certain lands and people\".
    No that would be a univariate analysis off course we can bring other variables
    in the picture based on our very own prejuidices.\r\nSo as a physician I would
    like to go  to the root, when the seed of this destruction was sown and judiciously
    examine all the factors which are perpetuating this conflict now called OCO.\r\n\r\n<i>This

Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   <em> Green is the theme color in the Shahzads' bedroom. The curtains pick up the tone of the bed linens, and a bamboo print hung between the windows extends the botanical motif.</p>
<p>    "There was nothing out of the ordinary about the house," Del Vecchio [his real estate agent] says. "There was nothing obvious; no radical posters or anything."</em></p>
<p>    --From a description of the home of Faisal Shahzad (&ldquo;The Times Square Bomber&rdquo;) in Connecticut, in CNN Money</p>
<p>When Faisal Shahzad was arrested for trying to detonate a bomb in Times Square last spring, his prepared statements, read out when he entered his guilty plea, were mostly ignored by the media. Instead we were treated to speculations about how and where he was "radicalized," and real estate slideshows of his abandoned over-mortgaged home in Connecticut: &ldquo;Our conversations were plain-vanilla, mostly about the real estate market,&rdquo; muses his former real estate agent. Where in this suburban drab do we see the makings of a bloodthirsty killer? Lorraine Adams's moving piece in the new Granta 112, an issue dedicated to Pakistan, is the first in-depth look at Shahzad's case that takes us beyond this befuddlement over the yawning chasm between his suburban d&Atilde;&copy;cor and the quickie seminar he took in bomb-making techniques from the Pakistani Taliban.</p></blockquote>
