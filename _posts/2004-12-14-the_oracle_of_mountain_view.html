  content: "I dunno about that CFP. It sure makes sense to me. There seems to be a
    ton of stuff being done about that pushes the family/nation metaphor to its logical
    conclusions, like using the idea of domesticity in the family as a metaphor for
    American nation-forming as well in the 19th c.  I'm just sayin' I've seen it
    done, and it's been assigned for class."

<p><img src="/img/digknow.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Via Cliopatria I learned of Google's partnership with libraries at Stanford, Harvard & c. to digitize their entire holdings. Copyrighted materials will only be available in selections and out-of-copyright texts (manuscripts!?) in their entirety. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/technology/14google.html?ei=5094&en=90f0998cafc80502&hp=&ex=1103000400&adxnnl=1&oref=login&partner=homepage&adxnnlx=1103037935-EtOkGGd929YeW5BFYLfdQA&pagewanted=all&position=">Here</a> is the NYT piece and <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/about.html">here</a> is more information about Google Print (beta). Rob has a good <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/detriment/index.php?p=71">post</a> on similair efforts elsewhere.</p>
<p>This advances my hopes/fears of an <a href="/archives/wizbango_tech/artificial_historians.html">Artificial Historian</a>. In the earlier post, I speculated with Amazon's <a href="http://www.a9.com">A9</a> technology. One can easily substitute Google Print here. Anyone using Gmail knows that Google does contextual analysis of your email (keywords leading to targeted ads). So, let's assume that Google has 4 or 5 research libraries scanned, how does that give us an academic text? By treating bibliographies as out-going and in-coming links in the <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/tech.html">PageRank</a> technology, Google can easily consolidate existing scholarship into the consensus view. Combine that with a wiki-type ability for users to weed out any incongruities. Summation, images, simple verb structure and you have your <i>Brief History of Summara</i> in less than a second.  Obviously, it won't use any primary Arabic sources since I doubt that Arabic will scan as text rather as image [regardless, I will be a happy happy man if I don't have to go to England every time I need to see one lousy manuscript for my diss]. </p>
<p>In related news, is this the right moment to start wondering about Google? I love them but who will own these archives? This knowledge free of walls and librarians? Probably no need to worry just yet. They ain't evil like <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/week_2004_12_12.html#001942">someone else</a>. But I would still prefer that our govt. would take more <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dli2/html/lcndlp.html">initiative</a>.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, I got a CFP that is noteworthy, "* Sexuality.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; If the nation is structured by discourses of sexuality, how might transnationalism "queer" the discourses of nation or of "home"?&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; In the borderlands or transnational sites, how do sexuality and displacement articulate one another?" HUH!?</p>
