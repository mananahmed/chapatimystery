<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/planforvictory.jpg"/>My favorite bit in the newly unveiled <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/iraq_strategy_nov2005.html">National Strategy for Victory in Iraq</a> aka <b>Plan for Victory</b>, is not that it is three years too late; not that there is no Arabic translation of this Plan available; not that the whole endeavor is <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/iraq/the-presidents-evolving-vision-140199.php">regressive</a>; not that there are cute checkmarks next to lines such as "As the terrorists themselves recognize..."; not that the words 'Islam', 'Muslim', or 'Rumsfeld' do not occur anywhere [or <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10255205/">"Enemies of the legitimate Iraqi government"</a>]; not that we learn that there are 3 million cell phones in Iraq today when a June 2004 DoC report put the number at <a href="http://www.export.gov/iraq/bus_climate/sector_overview.html#telecommunications">315,000</a> [million <a href="http://www.cellular-news.com/story/12807.shtml">likely</a> but I nitpick]; not that there are <b>eighteen core assumptions</b> ranging from the sappy "<i>like people in all parts of the world, from all cultures and religions, when given the opportunity, the Iraqi people prefer to live in freedom rather than under tyranny</i>" to the scary "<i>regional meddling and infiltrations can be contained and/or neutralized</i>"; no, my favorite bit lies among the quotes at the end of each Strategic Pillar: </p>
<p>Strategic Pillar Six, <i> "One of the most important ways to fight terrorism is to promote democracy, and one of the most important ways to promote democracy is the rule of law.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1; </i> - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, July 2005. That's <a href="http://msnbc.com/modules/newsweek/pdf/gonzales_memo.pdf">rich</a>, no? [pdf]. </p>
<p>Wrote David Denby at the end of his <i>Syriana</i> review in this week's NYer: <i>"...the taste of freedom has turned to wormwood and gall." </i></p>
