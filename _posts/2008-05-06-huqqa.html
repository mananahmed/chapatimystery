  content: "Grrrrrrrr .. this is such a tease!\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks before my birthday
    - I tell my best friend that I want to go to a hooka bar for my birthday because
    1. I have been wanting to try this since first seeing hooka pipes in Sarajevo
    when I was 14 and 2. Because it's the last legal place to smoke for us dinasours
    in Illinois.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks before my birthday - she quits smoking!"

<p>My grandfather's huqqa held unbelievable degree of fascination for me. I would often request that he smoke it - if only to hear the gurrhgurrhgurrh of the water. He often obliged. When he died, I was in the States. On my next trip, I asked what became of his huqqa - and no one seemed to know. Someone must have it. Things we lose.</p>
