<p><img src="/images/buffy.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>We discovered <i>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer</i> late - in the seventh season. And thanks only to <a href="http://www.iseemonsters.com/mt/archives/000117.html">sven</a>. Now, I admit, I am hooked. I love the humor, mainly. But, there are others to whom Buffyverse is a vast, uncharted space for interstatial observations.<br />
There is <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/2004/May/05012004/saturday/saturday.asp">Ken Kuykendall</a>, a Mormon youth leader, who uses Buffy to teach Christ.<br />
There is a <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/05/22/d405222102105.htm">literary theory thriller</a> where Buffy stands in for pomo-bashing.<br />
There is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812695313/qid=1085855437/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/002-4680396-4967205?v=glance&s=books">philosophy</a>.<br />
And, after all that is said and done: there is <a href="http://www.slayage.tv/conference/index.htm">The Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>. An <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/05/51835272.shtml?Element_ID=51835272">academic</a> affair that attracted philosophers, theologians, physicists(?) and literary critics.
