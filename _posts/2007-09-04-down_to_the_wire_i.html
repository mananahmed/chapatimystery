  content: "It's not about winning or losing, it never is and it never was. It's about
    making people around us realise their potential to do good and believe in it.
    \r\nYes, it was about love and may be still is, it was about science and still
    is, it is also about the impact teachers have on their students,it was about home
    and probably will never be. \r\nFinances are important (no one has to tell that
    to a scientist, after all PhD is interpreted as Poor Hungry Doctor) but that is
    not the end in itself, it goes beyond that. The truth (we might lie to each other,
    to our Gods but can we tell a lie to ourselves?, please a scientist can never
    do that, I can only refer to code of ethics for bioscientists)and it's search
    (with all the limitations we still have not been able to overcome) takes us to
    frontiers we can only reach with an open mind (be it cure of cancer, design of
    mass transit system in Karachi or schizopherina)and that is the goal of science.\r\n
    \r\nWe might fall now and then, we all need support... may be a woman needs it
    more than a man ... but who has seen tomorrow?"

  content: "i cannot say enough how much i love this show. the interviews in this
    video, i think, leave a little to be desired, but i am willing to forgive much
    in light of how incredibly groundbreaking this show is. i remember, after watching
    Season 4, i felt as though those kids were <em>real</em> and i'd see their faces
    every where i went. whcih sounds cliche and slightly twee, but i have never felt
    that way about any other piece of art.\r\n\r\nwhen does Season 5 come out?"
