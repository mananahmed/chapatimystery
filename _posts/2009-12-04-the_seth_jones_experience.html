  content: "\"Seth Jones, an analyst at the RAND Corporation and an adviser to U.S.
    special operations, has an op-ed in today's New York Times calling for an expanded
    drone war in Pakistan. Jones thinks the U.S. should target Baluchistan province,
    where the Taliban's senior leadership is reportedly based.  The NYT fails
    to mention that Jones' boss, Brig. Gen. Edward Reeder, might be involved in carrying
    out those aforementioned drone attacks in Baluchistan. (Noah Schachtman at Danger
    Room catches that detail.)  In any event, even if drone strikes might be
    successful at decapitating the Taliban leadership, this is the kind of reductive
    thinking that leads to tactical successes and strategic failures. A drone campaign
    in Baluchistan would be another huge infringement upon Pakistani sovereignty;
    it would inevitably kill civilians and stoke anti-American anger in Pakistan.
    It also risks linking Baluchistan's nationalist movement, a purely local grievance,
    with the U.S. war on terror. That's not an outcome U.S. policymakers want.\"

  content: "Excerpts from The Predator War http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_mayer
     \"According to a just completed study by the New America Foundation, the number
    of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President. During his
    first nine and a half months in office, he has authorized as many C.I.A. aerial
    attacks in Pakistan as George W. Bush did in his final three years in office.
    The study's authors, Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann,
    report that the Obama Administration has sanctioned at least forty-one C.I.A.
    missile strikes in Pakistan since taking office&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a rate of approximately
    one bombing a week. So far this year, various estimates suggest, the C.I.A. attacks
    have killed between three hundred and twenty-six and five hundred and thirty-eight
    people. Critics say that many of the victims have been innocent bystanders, including
    children.\" \"In the last week of September alone, there were reportedly four
    such attacks&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;three of them in one twenty-four-hour period.
    At any given moment, a former White House counterterrorism official says, the
    C.I.A. has multiple drones flying over Pakistan, scouting for targets. According
    to the official, &ldquo;there are so many drones&rdquo;
    in the air that arguments have erupted over which remote operators can claim which
    targets, provoking &ldquo;command-and-control issues.&rdquo;  General
    Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the defense contractor that manufactures the Predator
    and its more heavily armed sibling, the Reaper, can barely keep up with the government's
    demand. The Air Force's fleet has grown from some fifty drones
    in 2001 to nearly two hundred; the C.I.A. will not divulge how many drones it
    operates. The government plans to commission hundreds more, including new generations
    of tiny &ldquo;nano&rdquo; drones, which can fly after
    their prey like a killer bee through an open window.\" ... \"Should something
    go wrong in the C.I.A.'s program&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;last month,
    the Air Force lost control of a drone and had to shoot it down over Afghanistan&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it's
    unclear what the consequences would be.\" .... \"The development of the
    Predator, in the early nineteen-nineties, was supposed to help eliminate such
    mistakes. The drones can hover above a target for up to forty hours before refuelling,
    and the precise video footage makes it much easier to identify targets. But the
    strikes are only as accurate as the intelligence that goes into them. Tips from
    informants on the ground are subject to error, as is the interpretation of video
    images. Not long before September 11, 2001, for instance, several U.S. counterterrorism
    officials became certain that a drone had captured footage of bin Laden in a locale
    he was known to frequent in Afghanistan. The video showed a tall man in robes,
    surrounded by armed bodyguards in a diamond formation. At that point, drones were
    unarmed, and were used only for surveillance. &ldquo;The optics were
    not great, but it was him,&rdquo; Henry Crumpton, then the C.I.A.'s
    top covert-operations officer for the region, told Time. But two other former
    C.I.A. officers, who also saw the footage, have doubts. &ldquo;It's
    like an urban legend,&rdquo; one of them told me. &ldquo;They
    just jumped to conclusions. You couldn't see his face. It could
    have been Joe Schmo. Believe me, no tall man with a beard is safe anywhere in
    Southwest Asia.&rdquo; In February, 2002, along the mountainous eastern
    border of Afghanistan, a Predator reportedly followed and killed three suspicious
    Afghans, including a tall man in robes who was thought to be bin Laden. The victims
    turned out to be innocent villagers, gathering scrap metal.   In Afghanistan
    and Pakistan, the local informants, who also serve as confirming witnesses for
    the air strikes, are notoriously unreliable. A former C.I.A. officer who was based
    in Afghanistan after September 11th told me that an Afghan source had once sworn
    to him that one of Al Qaeda's top leaders was being treated
    in a nearby clinic. The former officer said that he could barely hold off an air
    strike after he passed on the tip to his superiors. &ldquo;They scrambled
    together an &Atilde;&copy;lite team,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;We
    caught hell from headquarters. They said 'Why aren't
    you moving on it?' when we insisted on checking it out first.&rdquo;
    It turned out to be an intentionally false lead. &ldquo;Sometimes
    you're dealing with tribal chiefs,&rdquo; the former
    officer said. &ldquo;Often, they say an enemy of theirs is Al Qaeda
    because they just want to get rid of somebody. Or they made crap up because they
    wanted to prove they were valuable, so that they could make money. You couldn't
    take their word.&rdquo;  The consequences of bad ground intelligence
    can be tragic. In September, a NATO air strike in Afghanistan killed between seventy
    and a hundred and twenty-five people, many of them civilians, who were taking
    fuel from two stranded oil trucks; they had been mistaken for Taliban insurgents.
    (The incident is being investigated by NATO.) According to a reporter for the
    Guardian, the bomb strike, by an F-15E fighter plane, left such a tangle of body
    parts that village elders resorted to handing out pieces of unidentifiable corpses
    to the grieving families, so that they could have something to bury. One Afghan
    villager told the newspaper, &ldquo;I took a piece of flesh with
    me home and I called it my son.&rdquo;   Predator drones, with
    their superior surveillance abilities, have a better track record for accuracy
    than fighter jets, according to intelligence officials. Also, the drone's
    smaller Hellfire missiles are said to cause far less collateral damage. Still,
    the recent campaign to kill Baitullah Mehsud offers a sobering case study of the
    hazards of robotic warfare. It appears to have taken sixteen missile strikes,
    and fourteen months, before the C.I.A. succeeded in killing him. During this hunt,
    between two hundred and seven and three hundred and twenty-one additional people
    were killed, depending on which news accounts you rely upon. \""

  content: "\"Certainly, aerial control did save British lives and money, but Iraqi
    and Afghan anger about civilian deaths and constant foreign surveillance produced
    decades of coups and conflict with the west, leading up to the current wars. Determined
    insurgents found ways to evade the &ldquo;all-seeing&rdquo;
    eyes in the sky. As long as the Royal Air Force remained in Iraq, where it functioned
    as an imperial administration (1922-58), the legitimacy of the &ldquo;independent&rdquo;
    Iraqi government was compromised and insurgency was rife.   The air policing
    regime lasted as long as it did because heavy censorship and secrecy prevented
    even officials from perceiving the extent of the damage it was doing. No one knew
    how many Iraqis and Afghans were killed. Likewise, today's
    drones operate in secrecy. The trickle of reports on air strikes cannot assess
    the number and identity of their victims. The US government routinely offers no
    comment on strikes. In a rare front-page story on the drones, The New York Times
    reported that 70 of the 195 $150m Predators had crashed but said nothing about
    human losses. In a recent interview, Col Kilcullen said in Pakistan 14 al-Qaeda
    leaders had been hit, at the cost of 700 civilian lives — &ldquo;a
    hit rate of 2 per cent on 98 per cent collateral. It's not
    moral.&rdquo;   The controversy over civilian deaths in a strike
    on Afghan villages last week is partly due to the fact that the bombs ripped people
    to shreds, leaving nothing left to count.   In short, there is no public
    scrutiny of drone activity or any reason to take their effectiveness on trust.
    Today's drones may be more precise than the crude bombers of
    the past, but they will not create a secure environment for Iraqi, Pakistani,
    Afghan or US interests. Military sceptics warn of the impossibility of analysing
    the data the drones collect.  News reports confirm that civilians are often
    caught in their lethal sights. Uncertainty about the number of deaths feeds rumours
    of the worst kind. Similarly, news of a temporary halt will not allay suspicions
    of their continued, even more covert use: the effort to defuse Afghan anger over
    last week's strike shows that when a covert imperial power
    issues a denial, no one listens. The casualties and the imposition of continual
    foreign surveillance provoke more anger and insecurity than the system contains.  Just
    as the British failure produced our present discontents, mistaken faith in an
    aerial panacea will fuel the conflicts of the future. Mr Obama must heed local
    rulers' requests to end drone attacks —
    as a matter of tactical as much as political wisdom. \"  The shadow of history

  content: "Omar - there is the question of operational effectiveness and civilian
    casualities: the US airforce has stated that 50% of its drones have either
    been shot down or crashed (with crashes being by far the greatest cause of loss)
    since 2001. Most attempts to record civilian casualties indicate that the number
    of civilian deaths per insurgent killed is very high, estimates range from 30
    civilians killed for every militant (according to official Pakistani figures)
    to 10 civilians killed for every militant.  The Brookings Institute had
    a paper on this,   http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/13+drones+kill+10+civilians+for+one+militant-za-09   I
    think with its high attrition rate and large civilian death rate, the drone is
    not a good substitute for effective intelligence on the ground or the use of ground
    forces. They might be of use to reach specific individual targets, in isolated
    and remote areas but are hardly suitable for mass deployment or use in populated
    areas - which is what some people and the Obama admin seem to be wanting to do."

    heavy infiltration of Taliban (and Taliban sympathizers) within the ranks of Pak

    thinking in terms of countries. Neither India nor Pakistan has control over 'insurgents'.
    They are running free from Assam, Nagaland to Baluchistan in British/Mughal India,
    or India and Pakistan as you call them.   What is wrong with being &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo;?
    Many Pakistanis were vegetarian in the 6th century AD.  The funny thing
    is most Hindus eat meat! Of course if your Hindu India is Brahmin Bania Middle
    Class land, its a different issue.  Hindu Jats used to eat meat till Dayanand
    told them they were ancient Hindus. That was in late 19th century."

<p><em>Seth G. Jones, the author of &ldquo;In the Graveyard of Empires: America's War in Afghanistan,&rdquo; is a civilian adviser to the American military.</em></p>
<p>One of the brains behind President Obama's Afghanistan policy Seth G.  Jones, of RAND & McCrystal has a particularly unhinged op-ed in today's NYT: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/opinion/04jones.html">Take the War to Pakistan</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>The United States and Pakistan must target Taliban leaders in Baluchistan. There are several ways to do it, and none requires military forces.</p>
<p>The first is to conduct raids to capture Taliban leaders in Baluchistan. Most Taliban are in or near Baluchi cities like Quetta. These should be police and intelligence operations, much like American-Pakistani efforts to capture Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other Qaeda operatives after 9/11. The second is to hit Taliban leaders with drone strikes, as the United States and Pakistan have done so effectively in the tribal areas.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The moral bankruptcy apparent in the contrast between two sentences ("none requires military forces") and ("to hit the Taliban with drone strikes") is breath-taking. "Baluchi cities" like Quetta only have a million or so people, after all. Our precision strikes are surely only to singe a few curled mustaches. Right, Jones? But, yeah, I know. Crying about civilian casualties from non-military force is a luxury that only the un-informed and un-educated can afford. There are hard choices to make for real wars to end. And harder sells to make, as <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/12/how-the-afghan-surge-was-sold/">Nathan Hodge demonstrates</a> in regards to Jones' colleagues, the Kagans. In any case, Seth G. Jones is so much "civilian" cover for a war that has<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04drones.html?_r=1&ref=world"> already spilled into Baluchistan</a>. And <a href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/12/04/about_those_civilian_fatalities">WITH ONLY 20 CASUALTIES</a>! Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Since Jones has never shown a predilection to history (or even an understanding of what "past" means. You can see some frank assessments of his <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/SB10001424052970204908604574336402390524212.html">earlier</a> <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/SB10001424052970204908604574336402390524212.html">works</a>, <a href="http://www.registan.net/index.php/2009/08/09/a-childrens-treasury-of-worthless-experts/">here</a> and <a href="http://easterncampaign.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/the-mystery-of-the-wall-street-journal-and-the-absentee-afghanists/">here</a>), so here be a crude lesson about what the U.S. is getting into in Baluchistan: an <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091105/REVIEW/711059990/1192">existing war</a> since 2004.</p>
<p>Seth G. Jones comes from the University of Chicago's political science program and is an advisee of John Mearsheimer. His dissertation, <em>The rise of Europe: Security cooperation and the balance of power</em>, deals with the EU and intra-country security apparatus. He has no access to any relevant language, or historical archive. All of which, of course, makes him the perfect man to construct and explain <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/Afghanistan_Dynamic_Planning.pdf">this</a>. [pdf]</p>
<p>I am too tired even to complain.</p>
