<p>Grover Cleveland thought he'd appease the public pissed off by his bungling of the <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/disasters/pullman_strike.html">Pullman Strike</a> by declaring the first monday in September as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day">Labor Day</a>. He lost the election. Maybe The Chosen One needs to declare another federal holiday in September. Call it Homeland Day. I mean, its already <a href="http://www.asyfreedomwalk.com/">started</a>... we just need to make it official.</p>
<p>Any ways. </p>
<p>Since I wasn't able to do my sunday reading special, I want to direct your attention to the September 22 [ah, nice date] <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/contents/20050922">New York Review of Books</a> which you need to buy and read. Great issue. </p>
<p>Also, look at this Reuters <a href="http://today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=lifeAndLeisureNews&storyID=2005-09-04T012638Z_01_FOR405104_RTRIDST_0_LIFESTYLE-LIFE-UGANDA-FILM-DC.XML">piece</a> on Mira Nair and her screenwriting academy, Maisha Film Lab, in Uganda. Sounds like a great and worthwhile project. More I read about her, the more I admire her. </p>
<p>Less will be more at CM for the next few weeks.</p>
