  content: "\"I should point that the NYT has been dissing the General [on the Editorial
    page] since 2004. Good for them.\"\r\n\r\nThey have... but mostly on realpolitik,
    geopolitical terms. At times, the NYT has sounded more like an analysis for the
    State Department to take into account, rather than what is really going on on
    ground in Pakistan, in regards to Pakistani citizens.\r\n\r\nVery rarely do they
    ever talk about issues concerning everyday Pakistani citizens. They mostly report
    on how Pakistan figures into the geopolitical calculus of the US:\r\n\r\n\"The
    best hope for diluting their political and GEOPOLITICAL influence...\""

  content: Given that Al Qaeda and the Taliban control large chunks of the country
    and ISI, is there anything that can possibly keep them from taking over the whole
    country?

  content: "AlQaeda&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;Taliban&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;ISI. Lets leave
    alone the \"control over large chunks of the country\". \r\n\r\nNow the editorial
    precisely makes it clear [or any of my previous 10 posts], that the overwhelming
    majority of the Pakistani population want the rule of democratic law, a free judiciary
    and a open media. \r\n\r\nMusharraf/Army/MMA/post-Taliban elements are the ones
    facing vast resistance from this groundswell of ordinary citizens across Pakistan."

  content: Hmm...  I could be getting things totally wrong (I know beans about South
    Asia), but ISTR news reports of Al Qaeda flags flying in the parts of Waziristan
    that were ceded to the Taliban.  And my previous comment was more of a worry that
    serves as an appendage to a general optimism regarding the groundswell of democratic
    opposition to M.

  content: "Jonathon, thanks for linking to that article, as it serves as a reminder
    of how Pakistan is depicted in the American media..\r\n\r\nMemorable highlights
    from this article:\r\n\r\n\"It may be time for the U.S. to face what it's long
    feared in the nuclear state: the prospect of chaos, rising Islamism or anti-Americanism
    that follows Musharraf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some see the Pakistani Army remaining powerful
    enough to prevent a chaotic transition or an Islamist takeover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Musharraf's
    vision is to make Pakistan like Turkey, where Islamic currents ebb and flow with
    popular sentiment, \"but who enforces what they call democracy? The military.\"
    \r\n\r\n\"Within three months, Musharraf has grown steadily weaker in the eyes
    of the security services, the Islamists, and the general public, compounding the
    doubts that some in the U.S. have over his commitment to taking on al-Qaeda.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    etc.\r\n\r\nIf I come across one more article that talks about \"Islamism,\" \"Islamic
    takeover,\" or basically anything with the word \"Islamic,\" I'm simply going
    to stop reading it. No point in wasting time reading incredibly redundant spiels-
    we've heard it all before. It's infuriating, this real politik talk. I'm on Sepoy
    with this- \"this tunnel vision\"  leaves me incredulous."
