    you see National Geographic's cover on Pakistan last month (http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0709/pakistan/pakistan.html)?
    What do you think of the story?  What do mean by India \"emerged stronger\"
    after BJP rule?"

  content: "Excellent article. It challenges the idea, espoused by left and right
    alike in South Asia, that we have always been just after the Fall; of the anteriority
    of a golden age. But I do have a question about your claim that India emerged
    stronger after the BJP. India may be suffering from sectarian fatigue but the
    body politic is not stronger than before.   I wonder if one might arrive
    at another conclusion earlier: that the Congress and other parties learnt to use
    the strategies of the BJP more effectively than the BJP itself. Not that the Congress
    was the paragon of secularism earlier, but it has learnt a few more tricks of
    speaking with forked tongue...  Thanks Rohit Chopra"

  content: "Sepoy:  Nice article!  One thing:  \"That religious
    parties provide one of those choices is not cause enough for us to deny them everything.
    After all, India emerged that much stronger after the BJP led governments from
    \ 1996-2004.\"  I'm not sure if I understand the connection you are making
    between the two assertions above. First off, I agree with the first assertion.
    But are you saying that if in Pakistan there comes an Islamic party to rule (which
    I don't believe will if there are fair and free elections), then post Islamic
    rule in Pakistan might leave Pakistan stronger? And how is India stronger after
    the BJP rule? I'd actually argue that it has left India weaker rather than stronger;
    they've left a political legacy built on Hindu nationalism- and they are certainly
    not the first to manipulate religion, no doubt [ie Congress and Sikhs in the 80's]-
    that still reverberates strongly with some segments of the Indian population,
    which unfortunately still have a lot of clout. Like you, I'm not saying that the
    very fact that the BJP came in power should be a reason to deny Indians from electing
    their leaders and as such in Pakistan.  But help with explaining the link
    between the two assertions..."

  content: "I should really clarify this, no? Damn you 1000 word limits. Basically,
    two broad assertions  1. The path to the elected bodies changes the rhetoric
    and goals of the religious based party 2. The body politic itself is able to
    judge the party on its governance, execution of the agenda, etc. and not just
    on wild promises.  How is India stronger? I think, as in all democracies,
    elections do educate, bring the conversation forward, reveal the growth (regress)
    of the nation. That Congress triumphed because of out-smarting BJP may or may
    not be true but I think it is true that the body politic _did_face a distinct
    choice and they changed the face of Indian democracy. To me, that is the strength
    of Indian democracy on the meta-level. All exceptions, as pointed out by Rohit
    and DI, are duly noted."

  content: "Sepoy:  \"1. The path to the elected bodies changes the rhetoric
    and goals of the religious based party\"  I agree with you to a certain
    extent. But we've also seen that since democracy theoretically means the freedom
    to vote, parties will often use slick rhetoric to accumulate votes. Bush is unabashedly
    a born-again-Christian; though he did not put Christianity/Evangelism at the forefront,
    he WAS able to attract Evangelists voters (and gung ho warriors). It's the same
    thing in India- it tones down the religious rhetoric somewhat, but not enough
    to the point where others who are more blatant about their religious politics
    will not vote for them.  \"2. The body politic itself is able to judge the
    party on its governance, execution of the agenda, etc. and not just on wild promises.\"  Yes,
    but that doesn't always deliver. In Indian politics, you rarely (and I mean, really,
    really, rarely) see any accountability. It seems as if elected politicians are
    not beholden to the voters. Yes, they want to get voted, and so will frame their
    platforms a certain way, target specific constituencies (but I am not sure if
    we are broadly interpreting \"voting\" as people faced armed thugs to vote for
    \ certain candidates, rigging, etc).  \"All exceptions, as pointed out by
    Rohit and DI, are duly noted.\"  But see, I don't think what I was pointing
    out was an \"exception\". We tend to think of the BJP, Gujarat 2003, New Delhi
    1984 (and scores of other places in India that we rarely hear about) as aberrations
    to an otherwise functioning  \"democracy.\" I actually think that these cases
    are symptomatic of something... I think along the lines of how \"democracy\"  is
    envisioned, the interpretation of democracy, the unaccountability, and what \"democratic\"
    practices mean in India and for Indians...  OK, back to work."

  content: "Sepoy:  \"The point about slick rhetoric has an added dimension
    within the Pakistani (and more generally in the Islamicate world) context\"  Yes..,
    but I was talking about what you said in your earlier comment: about democracy
    forcing religious parties to change their rhetoric as they're strolling down the
    path of electoral governance. My point was that in some cases, that \"change\"
    isn't a fundamental \"change\", even in democracies."

    and I would like to confess that I am somewhat ignorant about the Jamaat-i-Islami
    in the context you are talking about. I've tried to find out more about it, but
    haven't really come up with anything that shows an evolution in the party's platform
    as a result of political bargaining.  What I did come across, though, is
    their website:  http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/indexe.html  I could ask my questions
    to them as they have a Q&amp;A forum, but \"Q&amp;A Service is suspended for the
    time being. Hopefully, we shall be able to continue after Eid, inshaAllah.\"  Do
    you mind expanding on the \"that is the struggles between the avowed cosmology
    of these religious powers and the political bargains necessary\" bit in relation
    to JEI?"

  content: "Due to the kindness of someone who forwarded Nasr's paper \"Islamic Oppositin
    to the Islamic State,\" I have a better understanding of JEI.  But one thing:  I
    didn't fully understand why a party like JEI would want elections. Nasr's paper
    seems to be written for an audience that have some sort of background in Pakistani
    politics, and while I followed his argument, I asked myself why would it want
    elections at all.  I had the similar sensation when I read this paper a
    while ago:  http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=18553&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=zsa  In
    it, Grare discusses how the MMA wants elections and demands democracy. But this
    sort of baffles me, because if the MMA knows that 1) it's survival is somewhat
    dependent on Mush; 2) that it's success in the 2002 \"elections\" were a product
    of rigged elections, and 3) if there were to be fair and free elections, then
    MMA would definately not be successful, then why would it vociferously ask for
    elections?  To take it further, why would these religious parties in general
    even ask and push for elections given their political beliefs?"

<p>I have a small piece in this month's issue of <a href="http://www.nationalinterest.in/pragati/#Issue7-October07">Pragati: The Indian National Interest Review</a> on, well, Pakistan. I wasn't able to spend much time on this piece so I am unsure if it meets the standards of the journal.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://nationalinterest.in/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/pragati-issue7-october2007-communityed.pdf">download the issue</a> and circulate it around. </p>
<p>I should also congratulate Nitin Pai on a fine e-publication - which I should say has better production value than many a print-based circulations. Much to emulate here for both the scholarly and the policy community.</p>
