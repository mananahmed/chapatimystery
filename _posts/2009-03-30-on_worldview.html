  content: "Good job!  One question: you have, on more than one occasion, pointed
    to the collapse of the civilian state structure in Swat as one factor underlying
    the rise of the Taliban (i.e. as opposed to religious radicalization); I am insufficiently
    familiar with the history of the region, and my question is, what is different
    about Swat from other parts of Pakistan?  Is the problem that Swat is not administered
    the way the \"mainland\" parts of Pakistan (e.g. the provinces) are?  If so, then
    is the Swat-type situation possible in other parts of Pakistan's Northern Areas?
    \ Thanks."

  content: "On the Holbrooke/Kashmir point you mentioned, you might have mentioned
    that a lobbying effort might be responsible for why the original proposal was
    not implemented (not that I am complaining, but thought it was instructive and
    interesting):    http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/01/23/india_s_stealth_lobbying_against_holbrooke  My
    favorite was Zelikow's statement that \"leaving India out of the title actually
    opens up [Holbrooke's] freedom to talk to them...\" -- Orwell, anyone?"

  content: "LOL, so you did!  But after having fought an unsuccessful battle
    against resisting blogging and losing the rearguard action against joining Facebook,
    I am making a last stand and holding out against twitter - despite the entreaties
    of pretty much everyone else I know who have jumped on this bandwagon; probably
    only a matter of time before I cave as it is a doomed attempt at resistance but
    I will hold out for a while yet ;)"
