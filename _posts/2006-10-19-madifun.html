  content: "Glad that this topic is being discussed. I, for one, am terribly frustrated
    in attempting to navigate through the <a href=\"http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Library of India</a>, though they have phenomenal books.
    \ I guess they have taken the lazy way out by simply scanning the pages of books
    and uploading them. Thus, books in vernac languages are gif/jpeg/tif files. Each
    page is a darn file. \n\n\n\n{Unless I am confused as to what this topic is about}"

<p>A Huzzah! to my man Whitney Cox for defending his dissertation today. Much cel[r]ebration will be had. </p>
<p>And, tomorrow all concerned are going to the <a href="http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/">35th Annual South Asia Conference</a> at Madison. I have a panel <b>Digital Humanities for South Asia</b> with a paper, <i>From Diwan to Database: Digital Archives of South Asia</i> - along with pdcs. The exciting thing is that we have <a href="http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/panel9.htm">the worst</a> time-slot. So, l33t.</p>
<p>If any gentle readers want to meet up, you will know where to find me.</p>
