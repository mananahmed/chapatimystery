<p>I thought that mcsweeney's.net had jumped the shark but, i dare say, this is brilliant:<br />
<a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2004/4/28ward.html">Create Your Own Thomas Friedman Column </a>.</p>
<div id="blockquoted"> Speaking with a local farmer on the last day of my recent visit, I asked him if there was any message that he wanted me to carry back home with me. He pondered for a second, and then smiled and said, "[Short phrase in indigenous language]," which is a local saying that means roughly, "[Every branch of the tree casts its own shadow/That tea is sweetest whose herbs have dried longest/A child knows his parents before the parents know their child].</div>
