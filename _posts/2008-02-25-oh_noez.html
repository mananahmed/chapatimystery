  content: I don't understand why anyone should even feel compelled to defend himself
    on the charge of being a Muslim, if 'charge' is even the appropriate term (I don't
    think it is), as Obama has been made to feel he should. Surely defending yourself
    implies that it's something negative? I guess I can't fault him for wanting to
    clarify the truth but if so many people weren't so backward anyway it wouldn't
    make a difference. I don't care what he believes in as long as he's better than
    the monkey we've currently got masquerading as a president. That anyone would
    hope to benefit from the bigoted notions of others is truly sad but in no way
    surprising. Time to get back to those 'real issue' thingys now...

    distributing the picture, then firing the person who distributed the picture,
    suggesting that <i>someone</i> in the Clinton campaign thought it would be harmful
    to Obama and someone <i>else</i> in the Clinton campaign didn't want to be responsible
    for something that might be seen as divisive and underhanded.....

    if you get my meaning).....  Oh, what's the use?"

      I suppose being pictured in a cowboy hat in some French tabloid was on
    Chirac's mind?"

<p><a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ihq7tWGeXGYbg-0N0RawLORdpCkwD8V1INPG4">Obama Photo Causes Stir</a>, AP:</p>
<blockquote><p> A photograph circulating in the Internet of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama dressed in traditional local garments during a visit to Kenya in 2006 is causing a dustup in the presidential campaign over what constitutes a smear.</p>
<p>The Associated Press photograph portrays Obama wearing a white turban and a wraparound white robe presented to him by elders in Wajir, in northeastern Kenya. Obama's estranged late father was Kenyan and Obama visited the country in 2006, attracting thousands of well-wishers.</p>
<p>The gossip and news Web site The Drudge Report posted the photograph Monday and said it was being circulated by "Clinton staffers" and quoted an e-mail from an unidentified campaign aide. Drudge did not include proof of the e-mail in the report....</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, the joys of our enlightened, thoroughly modern society...Obama has no substance, 'tis true, but he does have lots of 'color' and he does like the Moslems and he hates the Jews. Yeah. Bring on the substantive debates...</p>
