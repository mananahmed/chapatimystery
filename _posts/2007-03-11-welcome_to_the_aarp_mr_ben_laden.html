<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSISL26622820070310?pageNumber=2">Happy 50th birthday</a> and welcome to the AARP! This is a <em><strong>very special birthday</strong></em> because it qualifies you for membership in one of the fastest growing organizations in the United States, the <a href="http://www.aarp.org/"><strong>American Association of Retired Persons</strong></a>.  AARP is all about beginnings, and depending on which type of membership you choose, this could be the start of <em><strong>the best years of your life</strong></em>.  Whether it's our monthly Magazine packed with news, entertainment and sage advice (yours with a basic membership package-- only $12.50 per month), our powerful advocacy efforts for issues that are important to informed seniors like you and me (such as Medicaid and Social Security), or our fantastic <strong>Mature Explorers&acirc;&bdquo;&cent; </strong>vacation packages and tours, <U>you'll find that AARP has a little something for everyone.</U><br />
<!--more--><br />
I know what you're thinking: <em>"Fifty is still a little young to be contacting me about senior issues, isn't it?"</em> Well, yes and no.  Being an AARP member isn't just about retirement and assisted living facilities; it's about making the <em>last</em> years of your life the <strong>best</strong> years of your life. And with the advances of modern medicine and technology these days, all of us are going to be around <strong>a lot longer</strong> to enjoy life a whole lot better and smarter than folks much younger than us.  </p>
<p>You know that old saying "youth is wasted on the young"? <strong>Not anymore</strong>.  At fifty, <strong>sixty</strong>, <em>seventy</em>, you could be continuing your education in <em>a monastery in Scotland</em> or at an <strong>Elder Seminar&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;</strong> hosted by a prestigious university anywhere in the world.  Pick up those hobbies you always dreamed of...<em>snorkeling in the Arabian Sea...making sand Mandalas in Tibet....big game hunting in the jungles of India</em>.  Or finally turn that fantasy love story into a reality by signing up for our <strong>Silver Foxes&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;</strong> dating network.</p>

Articles such the the cover story on Mirren, who recently won an <strong>Academy Award&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;</strong> for her amazing portrayal of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II, 81</strong>, keep you up to date with the inspiring accomplishments of seniors all over the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you, and welcome to the AARP Family&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;!</em></strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bill Novelli, CEO, AARP, <em>& fellow senior</em></p>
