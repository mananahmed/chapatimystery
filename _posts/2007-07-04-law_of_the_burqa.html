  content: "This is quite sad. These extremist \"Maulanas\" should be rounded up and
    put in jail. What was this man and his students hoping to achieve by creating
    such miscief? Anyway, do note that prominent Islamic scholars have condemned the
    recent endeavours of Lal Masjid.   Mufti Rafi Usmani, the \"grand mufti\"
    of Pakistan, said about these students actions that for actions to be acceptable,
    they have to be in accordance to the limits of the Shariah —
    and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) lived within the limits of the
    law and urged the believers to live within the limits of the law at all times.  Situations
    such as this, the Mufti said, are very dangerous, because Islam is a religion
    of law, and it commands its followers to abide by the law and to remain within
    its limits. When there are problems with the government, its laws, or the enforcement
    of those laws, then it is a believer's duty to take all legal
    means possible to seek to rectify matters. But one cannot take the law into one's
    own hand, as this is contrary to the Shariah and a recipe for lawlessness, crime,
    and vigilantism—and it creates very dangerous precedents."

  content: Musharraf can not shutdown any Madrisah, madrissas are good for dictator,
    to divert attention from real issues to staged ones. and the Madrassah students
    are brain washed actors filled with passion and they are never afraid of cameras.

  content: "This act or so-called maulana has created many problems for the muslim
    girls who always wear veil in public. Now whenever a groups of \"burqa-poosh khawatein\"
    is spotted in public place, it will create a doubt in the mind of people about
    the possibility of a suicide bomber or a militant in the disguise of a veiled
    girl. So the security forces specially our policemen who never leave such chance
    might interrupt those women, and ask them for their identity. This could create
    a lots of problem for poor girls. Not only in Pakistan, but in othe countries
    where girls are still allowed to use scarf or naqaab, might ban veil, due to the
    same reason."

  content: "@ali shahan: pity the poor <i>rangroot tulla</i>, who legally only ever
    gets to feel up his wife. how liberating for our law enforcement agencies. perhaps
    they might be distracted and titillated enough at the prospect of feeling up mysterious
    gunnysacked women to consider a reduction in their daily <i>bhatta</i> collection
    activities."
