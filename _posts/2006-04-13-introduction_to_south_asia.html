  content: Any thoughts on Wolpert's A New History of India?  I had that in gradschool
    and was considering using it for a South Asia 1200-present course.  My husband
    is a big fan of Keay.

  content: I think Keay is best of the lot, well written and accessible to students;
    made relevaant with references to the present and a book of an ideal length. precisely
    for these reasons, an Ustad of ours doesn't like it. Burton Stein is not either.
    But my vote actually is for the old NCERT text books for class 11 and 12. R S
    Sharma (ancient), Satish Chandra (medieval) and Bipan Chandra wrote three good
    text books of appropriate length for an introductory class, with the right amount
    of details. as the planner of five courses (as per the mandate of my new chair),
    i am seriously thinking about writing my own introductory book, if Sepoy and Rajeev
    were to cooperate!

  content: "i have used ludden, which i love, and my students uniformly dislike. too
    dull and plodding, they say as i gnash my teeth. but it is quite dense, and the
    overlapping chronology confuses them. bose/jalal is not really a textbook and
    students are either confused or left cold by the polemic. plus it follows the
    lecture format too closely. metcalf is a good intro text for a grad seminar, not
    an undergrad text for a survey course, not enough detail. i have used burton stein
    because it is a good textbook in terms of its coverage, chronology and narrative
    and it covers south india which none of the others (except for ludden) really
    do, but it has some awkward and somewhat quaint moments that make me think i'll
    drop it next year. need to look at Keay. check out Cynthia Talbot's new book,
    \"India Before Europe,\" which I just bought and leafed through and it looks great.
    Need to go through it properly before fully deciding though. I think it would
    work well with another book for the post-1700 period. \n\nWould really like to
    discuss these in detail at the Initiative, once it gets going."

    vausey: Wolpert is a complete turn-off for me for reasons aplenty. Did you enjoy it?
    pdcs: yeah, we must write our own wiki-text.
    desiknitter: i agree w. all of your assessments esp. on the jalal/bose reading which, i kept imagining the narrator constantly scolding me. I liked the metcalfs b.c they actually used some visual culture which, well, let's say hasn't quite made it into south asia textbooks just yet. Will check out C. Talbot. Any word on the Markovits?

    And the Intiative comes soooooon.

    It's not really a "historical overview" sort of book, but I think Sunil Khilnani's "The Idea of India" would be a useful book to assign as a supplementary text to some of the ones you've listed...I think its sections on the colonial city, on the politics of identity, on political centralization would be particularly useful to students...



    I really dislike the Wolpert book, it's quite banal.  Keay seems promising; what about the Kulke/Rothermund book? (I haven't read it)...

  content: PS-- finding books on Pakistan and Bangladesh is a real problem; I mean
    one can find texts on discrete areas, but "overview" books are few and far between.  My
    brother pointed me to "A History of Pakistan and its Origins" (ed. Christophe
    Jaffrelot) which appears to have been published fairly recently; I haven't read
    it though, and would be interested in hearing what people think about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1843311496/qid=1144998506/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-7013378-0608763?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">it</a>.

  content: "I agree for the most part with desiknitter's points on Ludden, Bost/Jalal
    and Stein, and am also quite keen to see what Talbot has put together (it looks
    like the last few chapters will even work for Rajeev's post-1600 course).  Though
    Wolpert was the first survey I read, I cannot imagine actually teaching from it
    (straight up, profoundly bland political chronology for chapters at a time).  When
    I next design a South Asia survey, I will definitely have a look at the old NCERT
    texts that the good Doctor Professor of Limeland suggests, and would add that
    parts of Sumit Sarkar's Modern India text could also work quite well alongside
    other materials.  I think Kulke/Rothermund is actually quite good on pre-modern
    South Asia, but undergrads tend to find the book excessively dense.  Have only
    paged through it, but Peter Robb's textbook is definitely something else to put
    in the mix.  \n\nIt seems like most everyone who has taught a South Asia survey
    is coming out with their own textbook these days, and ultimately the best thing
    to do might be to take the slimmest possible survey and supplement with articles
    and the odd chapter from the wide array of textbooks out there.  I used this method
    when teaching Islamic history last year and it worked very well.  Personally,
    I have some pedagogical problems with the premise of a single textbook with full
    coverage in the first place - it is rather like the everythign-under-one-roof
    Walmart philosophy applied to the wild and diverse world of history.  Students,
    especially weaker ones, tend to use whatever survey text they have as a framework
    into which to insert whatever other materials get covered in the course without
    bothering to question the ordering of the textbook in the first place.  I prefer
    to disabuse them of such crutches and try to encourage an understanding of the
    complity of historical developments, and the contingency of explanatory narratives
    (call me a postmodernist).  Certainly some students (especially the more scientific
    minded among them) will feel a bit confused and rudderless for a while, but most
    seem to come around eventually and develop the ability to navigate for themselves.
    \  \n\nThe wiki Sourcebook Initiative is going to be an excellent thing, so let's
    get it rooollllllin'."

  content: "What a fun discussion! \n\nI haven't looked at Markovits. Wolpert is terrible.
    Peter Robb also came out with a Modern India book recently. And I use sections
    of Sumit Sarkar too. Cynthia Talbot, incidentally, has co-authored with Catherine
    Asher the art historian and the book seems to have great stuff on mughal miniature
    paintings, temple architecture, etc. I used some sections from Kulke-Rothermund,
    but the language was way too dense and clunky. Also some very startling moments,
    such as their insistence that Partition/Pakistan was ultimately the making of
    one man alone, Jinnah.\n\nI accept the problems associated with textbook teaching
    but at a basic survey level class it is also important to emphasize basic historical
    developments and get students to know and familiarize themselves with them (go
    ahead, call me a positivist!:)). Most supplementary readings in journals or edited
    chapters are written for peers and assume a great deal of prior knowledge of the
    context, and students get lost, or outright miss the point. When these articles
    are discussed in class, I end up using my own time filling in this context, which
    is frustrating. \n\nRe. Khilnani, I have used it twice for 20th c. south asia
    survey and I agree, if I can get over the oh-so-elegant prose it focuses concepts
    really well. But it's difficult finding non-polisci articles or a book that gives
    students some information and historical background about the contexts that produced
    the khalistan movement, the emergency, the bangladesh language movement, naxalbari,
    nehruvian socialism ..but for Pakistan, I found some chapters of Ian Talbot's
    \"Pakisan: A Modern History\" useful and so did my students; would appreciate
    other comments on it. Accha, he also has a \"India &amp; Pakistan\" survey that
    I have productively used some chapters from.\n\nUltimately, so much of this choosing
    of articles has also depended on how large the course packet can get to remain
    affordable."

    is a very good introduction and I like the way old Barney thinks about Indian
    history. I notice none of you commented on my other fav, the NCERT text books.
    Don't blame you. If you had had a JNU education (Prachi is an exception here)
    and if you had envisioned being part of Indian civil service, you would have read
    these books closely and learnt to appreciate the usefulness. \n\nSepoy, the wikitext
    is appealing but i wouldn't mind also producing a text that brings some cash too.

    I also haven't seen the new NCERT history books; I did try to get them but they weren't available. May be i should try to get them this summer and write a detailed review. Satish Chandra's medieval India is probably my favorite and Bipan too has some good chapters on European traders, colonialism and freedom movement, which are all accessible, even if they are ideological to a certain extent. that's the key.

    I like Khilnani's Idea of India, have used it to good results but it would be appropriate for a course on the 20th century India. If we can have one  or possibly two reference works which provide the history of the subcontinent, then course packet can do the trick. But it is imperative to have that one book, which students can refer to get their dates, chronology, geography and general context. John Keay is good for this purpose.

    I vote for Sumit Sarkar and the first few chapters of Discovery of India.  History of Modern India was one of the best books on India I've ever read.

    I also didn't like Wolpert, which my undergrad professor used.  I can't put a finger on why.

    Also, for partition, it might be interesting to use Joya Chatterji's book on the partition of Bengal to counter the conventional narrative that Muslims were responsible for Partition and to focus some attention on the Partition in the East.

    I think Nehru's "Discovery..." is a great idea, though I certainly agree it should be used in conjunction with something else (Khilnani is a good juxtaposition).



    someone else: certainly at a popular level the stereotype persists, but I find that in academia we have a reverse-- not stereotype certainly but almost a reflex by now-- narrative of partition populated by a misunderstood Jinnah and overwhelming Congress responsibility.

<p><img src="/images/indiamodern.jpg"/>Rajeev is currently planning a course on South Asia History 1600-present [!] and pdcs is planning 5 courses as well. Inevitably, the conversations are on what texts to assign and to what purpose. This happens every spring as we all sit down to plan Fall courses. I asked for suggestions for an Intro on <a href="/archives/univercity/islamic_history.html">Islamic history</a> and got some recommendations before which proved quite helpful. So, in the interest of gathering some more knowledge into the pool [incidentally, the ultimate pool will be the <a href="http://www.southasiasourcebook.org/">Initiative</a> once I actually start working on it], I thought to open the discussion on what general intro South Asia texts would you recommend? Any favs? Any hatez? What has good narrative? nice maps? glossary? Any contenders out of left field? Anyone pay attention to Pakistan or Bangladesh or Nepal?</p>
<p>A list of possibilties: </p>
<ul>
<li>David Ludden's <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=1851682376">India & South Asia: A Short History</a>.
</li>
<li>John Keay's <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=0802137970">India: A History</a>
</li>
<li>Metcalfs' <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=0521639743">A Concise History of India</a>
</li>
<li>Jalal & Bose's <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=0415169526">Modern South Asia</a>
</li>
<li>Claude Markovits' <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=1843311526">History of Modern India 1480-1950</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have taught the Metcalf and Jalal to varied results. The chapter/essay approach leaves a bit to be desired in my head. Haven't seen Markovits but Ludden's is quite good, I think. What say ye?</p>
