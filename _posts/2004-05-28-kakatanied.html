<p>Main Entry: Kakatanied<br />
Pronunciation: 'ka'ka'ta need<br />
Function: verb<br />
Etymology: High English Critic, from New York Times, of Japanese origin; akin to recluse authors like Pynchon, prone to lashing out in fury on Great White Authors like Roth, Mailer.<br />
1 a : to pulverize, to ridicule by a quaint twist of phrase, to shame out of existence [largely literary], to make white men shed the tweed and confront the scorn of a double minority who loathes their middle-browed, infantile, over-adjectivied writing, to refuse to kowtow before the earthen gods of the day set on their pedestal awaiting your offerings, to be snarky.<br />
Example: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/28/books/28BOOK.html?8hpib">Samuel Huntington's <i>Who Are We?</i></a>. "A crotchety, overstuffed and highly polemical book". "...what amounts to a 400-page PowerPoint presentation.". "... also pockmarked with perplexing contradictions and curiously blindered observation."<br />
<i>intransitive senses</i><br />
1 <i>obsolete :</i> <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/1999/01/23michiko.html">I am Michiko Kakatuni</a>.<br />
2 <i>in vogue:</i> <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/gems0402.html">I love Michiko Kakatuni</a>.</p>
