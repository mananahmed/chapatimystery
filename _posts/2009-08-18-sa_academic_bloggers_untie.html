  content: "Completely off-topic, I went over to Mircae's blog... it is very well-written,
    but while going through the comments on one of his posts, I came across the following,
    ah, gem:\r\n\r\nhttp://dalitnation.wordpress.com/2007/12/14/aishwarya-rai-a-victim-of-brahmin-conspiracy/\r\n\r\nJust
    goes to show that we Pakistanis have some stiff competition when it comes to conspiracy
    theories!"

    by sip for days on end. An early fav: \"Also please note I am a bachelor and if
    you have any phone number or email IDs of your other sisters who are similar to
    Aishwarya rai please let me know. I can marry her and prevent the evil upper caste
    people from enjoying our women. Jai Bhim\"\r\n\r\nvivek: loosen up, dude."

  content: "ok dude, but I am going to insist on claiming Szerelem for the Turkish
    studies blogosphere too (South Asian though she may be) because we are sorely
    outnumbered by y'all, and have to sit at the non-Arabist kids' table at MESA.
    \ We need her.\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, I've noticed an uptick in the numbers
    of desi folks (of various citizenships) in Middle Eastern studies programs, though
    the vast majority are working on Arab (and sometimes Iranian/Persian) topics;
    very few in the Ottoman/Turkish studies ghetto.  I'm hoping this bodes well for
    scholarship thinking across &amp; breaking down area studies lines, as well as
    just some fresh perspectives.   You've heard me on the Turkey/Pakistan military
    politics thing before (who's going to write that book, seriously?) and some interesting
    comparative work on secularisms is afoot, too.\r\n\r\nalso, Nostalgic's link is
    some shiny internet gold."

    there are broader South Asian tropes underlying everything (cricket especially!)
    Incidentally, for those interested in figuring out how the goofy American economy
    is working (or not) post-financial meltdown, this is a great blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://baselinescenario.com/\r\n\r\nCheers

<p>I am still in the weeds. But, classes are about to start around towns and I just got a note from a new blogger and graduate student, <a href="http://justspeculations.blogspot.com/">Mircae</a> - which reminded me to put up a general call for SA academic blogs. If you have one, or read one, put it up here in the notes. Like CM friend, <a href="http://szerlem.blogspot.com/">Szerlem</a> - old blogger but new to the grad-school column. Older SAists can also chime in but really, who cares about you old fogies, anymore?</p>
