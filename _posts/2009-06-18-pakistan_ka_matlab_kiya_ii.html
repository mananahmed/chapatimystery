  content: "The thought of Shahid Afridi being Taliban anything is making me giggle.
      Also, I have for the longest time had a soft spot for the SA team  (weird
    I know - but its a hang over of loving and crying over that 1999 team) and as
    of now I want to punch something. I mean seriously, when the fuck will they stop
    chocking?!"

    i don't know a better celebration in world sport than the finger pointing, chest
    puffing look around...  agree with you on the blood pressure thing - it's
    so infuriating, especially as this time around one had to go through it in matches
    involving holland and ireland as well..."

  content: 'Qalandar: ha, yes I''m probably one of the outliers! :) I was for the
    longest time obsessed with Rhodes and Pollock and also liked very much Kirsten,
    Gibbs, Boucher, Klusner -  you get the drift, basically most of the Cronje era
    SA team. And then everything just kept going downhill from that 1999 WC semi final.
    I do like Smith though, but overall have more or less shifted loyalties to football!'

  content: "Sahibzada Muhammad Shahid Khan Afridi is a Tebleeghi Jamaat devotee, like
    numerous former (and current) players, some of whom have successfully laundered
    their pasts with their association with that group... (yes, match fixing)...  In
    Afridi's case, it is a peccadillo worth forgiving if he keeps performing the way
    he has been of late..."

    single shot, every single wicket pours in thousands of tweets as if twitter is
    their virtual cricket stadium and they did something very astonishing, an entire
    new trend — they changed their display pictures to Green."

    cricket has been facing over the last couple of years, this will be a welcome
    boost I am sure.    And, in keeping with the \"pan-desi\" vibe on this site,
    I note that all 4 finalists in the 2 20/20 world cups so far have been sub-continental
    teams..."

  content: 'Actually, my comment got me thinking: in fact, even w/r/t the ODI world
    cups, 6 of the 9 world cups have featured one desi finalist (3 of them winners);
    the last five have all done so (2 of them winners, Pakistan in ''92 and Sri Lanka
    in ''96).  In a historical sense Bangladesh has really under-performed: despite
    flashes of brilliance, there has been no sense that the team has become stronger
    in the decade since it was accorded official status.  [By contrast, even historic
    under-performer India had shown far more consistent threat in its first decade
    (1930s); SL was a slow starter, but by 1992-93 was clearly significantly improved
    from when it was granted official status in the early 1980s; and Pakistan had
    won a test match in England as early as 1954.]'
