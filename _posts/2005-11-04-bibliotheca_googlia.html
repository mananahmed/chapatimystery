  content: We all know what the British did to the Indian Subcontinent over a 200
    year period.  Just because they wrote some books on the tyrant Muslim rulers (who
    subjugated India through mass conversion), do you feel that their goal in writing
    these texts was to promote the glory of the Islamic race?  Let's face it the majority
    of Muslims in the world are looked down upon as "converts" by the Saudis who feel
    that they themselves were the chosen race.  The Holy Prophet (PBUH) was born to
    the Arabs, so these Saudis feel they are superior to all other Muslims.  I ask
    you for your own experiences during Hajj or Umrah, candidly discuss your interaction
    with the native Saudis.  Also, it was't just the Hindus that were obsessed with
    the caste system.  During Hajj you will find that Muslims from all different countries
    are segregated into camps (of their national origin).  There have been documented
    cases of black muslims of senegal kicked out of Bangladeshi and Turkish tents.  It's
    a sad state of affairs.  At any rate, I digress.  What is your point of drawing
    our attention to these archaic texts from the Harvard annals, written by British
    rulers with an unquestionable "hidden-agenda"?

    1. Don't use Mai's name to leave comments at different blogs. This is very unfortunate that people are exploiting her name and putting what ever voice they want behind her name.

    2. Hear to the message of Quran not Arabs. People always make mistakes even so called humanists and ahtiests.

    MM : I can't speak for sepoy, but I think the point of the post was that these "archaic texts" are now viewable to everyone outside of the Harvard annals, with just a simple web search. Hence the "Tell me if you find something good...". I strongly doubt that there is any other agenda than that.

    Though I am surprised that this post wasn't also part of the "wizbango! tech" category as Google Print is a web portal.
