President Roh presented the Commander with many gifts, including the DVDs of "YMCA Baseball Team, Strokes of Fire, and the hit drama Daejanggeum (<a href="http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/daejanggum/">&euml;&OElig;&euro;&igrave;ž&yen;&ecirc;&cedil;&circ;</a>), which features Lee Young-ae (<a href="http://www.leeyoungae.net/">&igrave;&acute;&igrave;&tilde;&igrave;&bull;&nbsp;</a>), known as one of Kim's favorite South Korean actresses."  President Roh added that "The stories are good but the qualities of the pictures are just as good. These days, there are a lot of movies that gather a lot of attention with good visuals.'' </p>
