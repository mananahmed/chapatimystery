President Roh presented the Commander with many gifts, including the DVDs of "YMCA Baseball Team, Strokes of Fire, and the hit drama Daejanggeum (<a href="http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/daejanggum/">&euml;&OElig;&euro;&igrave;ž&yen;&ecirc;&cedil;&circ;</a>), which features Lee Young-ae (<a href="http://www.leeyoungae.net/">&igrave;&acute;&igrave;&tilde;&igrave;&bull;&nbsp;</a>), known as one of Kim's favorite South Korean actresses."
