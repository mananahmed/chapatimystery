  content: "I found his description of the marching lawyers&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;'like emperor penguins in a nature film'&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;oddly touching.  Also, got to meet AJ at work earlier this year and was v. impressed by her in person: not only forceful and eloquent (to be expected) but generally unpretentious &amp; down-to-earth, really taking the time to engage with everyone in the room.  Quite a contrast to some other human rights high-flyers I've encountered, who shall remain unnamed."

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/23/070723fa_fact_dalrymple?printable=true">Days of Rage</a> by William Dalrymple looks at Asma Jahangir - and Lal Masjid - in the NYer. The piece lacks his usual narrative flair but maybe because the Lal Masjid stuff seems a late add-on. Worth a read just for the profile of Asma Jahangir whom I have admired for a very long time. </p>
