<p><img src="/img/fox.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Mexico's President Fox came to UChicago and all I got was these lousy <a href="/fox/fox.html">pictures</a>. I guess there was no media allowed so these pictures are worth money...uh, maybe not. They are from Nancy's office - which is the office opposite mine. I missed the Mariachi band, 'cause I was at lunch. Sad about that, really. President Fox is an alum of the Law School here and I have <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/061504_ns_presidentfox.html">no clue</a> why he was on campus.<br />
But the security was tight! right. since this whole building across from where he was, remained unchecked.<br />
They did stop Scott from crossing the street. Mostly because he looks like a <a href="http://www.magnusmusic.net">musician</a>.</p>
