  content: HA. I did, I did. But the criteria is that the movie must have had an impact
    on the wider world of Indian cinema. Much as I love Dewaar, Garam Hawa and Satya
    - were they widely seen, and copied? I am missing Benegal for the same reason.
    Now, why am I missing Satyajit Ray, is the real question.

  content: "Sepoy, you began with <i>\"considered influential in Indian film history,
    culturally or artistically\"</i> and put out a list that included very few films
    that spun off a genre. I am deeply disappointed. \n\nConsider, for instance, Ankur
    by Shyam Benegal. It is a singular film that began the art cinema movement which
    lasted over a decade and produced very influential films and gave us stellar performers.
    \n\nConsider Zanjeer and Deewar, which gave us the angry young man who replaced
    the romantic hero-persona of Rajesh Khanna in much the same way  that Guru Dutt
    (Sahir/Abrar Alvi) wanted to break away from the Dev-Dilip-Raj genre. They did
    it by exposing the flawed implementation of a (now failed) ideology in all its
    nakedness. I am very surprised that you did not list Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam (and
    Kaagaz Ke Phool) in that list. V.K. Murthy's seminal camerawork in those films
    has influenced everyone from Nihalini/P.C.Sriram/Mani Ratnam/Ram Gopal Varma onwards.
    \n\nSikander (Sohrab Mody, Prithviraj Kapoor), the mother of movies like M-e-A,
    Anarkali and others. Pakeezah was a dud and if it influenced anything, it was
    the death of the period drama for a long time. How about Sujata? Anmol Ghadi?
    Godan? How could you forget Saigal's 'Devdas'? How about the films that were <a
    href=\"http://www.sulekha.com/expressions/articledesc.asp?cid=302508\" rel=\"nofollow\">popular
    in Greece</a>?\n\n'Bombay' did not influence anything. Nor was it historical.
    If you wanted a film on religious riots, you could've chosen Bhisma Sahni's 'Tamas'
    on the '47 partition. On the other hand, Roja spun was singular. It was the first
    film that named Pakistan directly and set out a cascade of (unfortunately badly-made)
    films in that genre, including a forgettable 'Mission Kashmir' which was, incidentally
    written by Suketu Mehta and Vikram Chandra. \n\nSholay actually killed a genre.
    It was the last of the dacoit-based films since no one dared take on that theme
    anymore. However, it was also the first film in which the villian became popular
    - so much so that he modelled in ads (for Glucose biscuits).\n\nGulzar's 'Mere
    Apne' (1971) was s superb film that tackled student unrest and rebellion at the
    failure of govt. The songs had <a href=\"http://s94437128.onlinehome.us/isb/cisb/649.isb\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">biting lyrics</a> that struck home. [The film was sorta remade
    into 'Ankush' in the 80s.]\n\nHDDCS should not be in any list. :-) I would replace
    that with 'Tezaab' since it was responsible for the rise of Madhuri. It is a terrible
    film, though. \n\nSome timeless films that have not necessarily influenced films
    in general:\nGolMaal\nJaane Bhi Do Yaaron\nKaliyug\nArdh Satya\nChashm-E-Buddoor\nShree
    420\nAnand\nNamak Haram\nIjaazat\nGaman\nSalim Landge Pe Mat Ro\nAlbert Pinto
    Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai?\nand so on...more later."

    Quizman, <i>HDDCS</i>'s representation of "Italy" is quite possibly one of the best FUs I've ever seen given to Europe, colonisation, and cultural exploitation. I don't know if that is a common way (in Bollywood) to represent Europe, but it was the first, most naked site of it I encountered.

    So just on that, it deserves to be on <i>some</i> list...

    Sepoy - Why indeed are you missing Satyajit Ray??!! He put Indian cinema on the international map waaay before Lagaan, surely! Not to mention significantly influencing the art of filmmaking both in India and abroad. And Shatranj Ke Khilari was not his best work either!

    I thought you said this list was of movies "influential in Indian film history, culturally or artistically", yet I'd say that the influence of most of the films on your list was more in the commercial (and perhaps arguably some popular culture thereby) realm rather than artistic.

    As a newcomer developing a Chapati habit in recent weeks due to the generally excellent content here, I'm rather disappointed... for this list seems to represent more the hegemony of Bollywood / mainstream Hindi movies than artistic influence. I'd say quizman is on the right track for such a list, but you are both still limiting yourselves to Hindi movies - so perhaps the list should be labeled as such!

    I assumed that it's a typo and you didn't really mean Benegal, since he made almost all of his films in Hindi (the rest in English). :-) Probably Ghatak, Karnad or Kasaravalli.

    Morcy,

    Actually, I thought B&P was trash precisely because it was a film that had a director with a <a href="http://quizfan.blogspot.com/2005/02/too-much-prejudice.html" rel="nofollow">jaundiced view</a>. And the film does not even pretend to be art. It is basically a kitschy imitation of what Chadda perceives to be a imitation of the Hindi film industry. Naah, it was crap. I had gone with 10 other friends (all Indians). Most of us wanted to leave half-way. We stayed because it was raining outside the theatre. :-)

    Q: I don't fully understand your complaint about the jaundiced view---are you saying that the movie is made with contempt for Bollywood? That may be, but that's one of the paradoxes. Lalita's saying she'd never leave India, since the US has nothing for her, is the exact thing that Rai is contradicting by being in the movie. I read your piece and understand your position, but as a mediation on cultural capital, instead of "simply" globalisation of the marketplace, the movie gets trickier.

    Isn't the "kitschy imitation" precisely a reflection of the fact that Hollywood can only shittily imitate Bollywood? <i>B&P</i> is a great example of the form telling us as much about the politics as the content.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/mkas.jpg"><b>update</b>: Ok, ok. ok. Now, I am in it for the glory. We shall compile the Top 25 of Indian Cinema for a newbie. The movies should be representative of genres, influential directors or stars, cultural themes or epochs, and regional film industries. They should have had popular appeal. They should be available on DVD in the states [with subtitles if possible]. Consider this list a must-see starting point for any exploration of Indian cinema.  Post your picks in the comments, I will compile and release for the sake of humanity by Monday. We can wiki the post, later.<br />

Cleaning out my desktop, I came across this list that was compiled over a few pale ales on my back porch. Dman asked for a list of movies that can be considered influential in Indian film history, culturally or artistically. Basically, a must-see list for a newbie to Indian cinema. The list below was made by the help of some fine connoisseurs and I was gonna do a longish post about the movies, and their reason for inclusion. Like THAT will ever happen. So, in the interest of public discourse, I am pasting the list. Tell me if it is missing something or has something amiss with it. </p>
