    in The Tribune. I immediately requested a friend to bring it for me from India.
    Now I feel ashamed that I put her to all the trouble. It cost her 750 rupees,
    but it is not even worth the price of the paper it is printed on.\"\r\n\r\nCM
    Naim, still showing us how it's done."

  content: "I read the review and thought, \"Ouch.\" :) Still though, if the book
    is as awful, inaccurate, and flimsy as argued, then the review was well deserved.\r\n\r\n\"Worse
    still, the translations are often deliberately misleading.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes
    me cringe. I used to be a translator, and I was asked by the head of the religious
    institute to translate a seminal body of work into English. There were two/three
    chapters that had already been translated, and when I read them, they were totally
    off the base, not even close to what was being said in Italian. Dis/misinformation
    is evil."

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/10/aziz_hist_back.thumbnail.jpg' alt='aziz_hist_back.jpg' />Naim sahib has a <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20071001&fname=naim&sid=1">scathing review</a> in <i>Outlook India</i> of S.M. Azizuddin Husain's <i>1857 Revisited/&Oslash;&macr;&Oslash;&sup3;&Oslash;&ordf;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&circ;&Ugrave;&Scaron;&Oslash;&sup2;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&ordf;&Ugrave;¬ê &Oslash;&ordm;&Oslash;&macr;&Oslash;&plusmn; </i>. The book is a compendium of 150 primary documents relating to the uprising and its aftermath, with translations and an introductory essay. A fine idea, in principle, but the problem, as Naim Sahib points out, is in the execution:</p>
<blockquote><p> Reading most newly published Urdu and Persian books in India is a painful experience. This book, however, is worse than many. (Perhaps I should not blame only the editor for it. I know from my own experience that the people who compose Urdu books on computers do not like to be corrected, and unless one persists they let their errors stand.) Exasperated by endless errors of misreading and mistyping, I turned to the English translations, only to discover a greater horror. I had assumed it was a bilingual book, containing Urdu and Persian original texts, together with English translations. I was badly mistaken. The translations are by no means full; they are abridgments and summaries - another fact that Prof Husain fails to mention in his introduction. Worse still, the translations are often deliberately misleading. </p></blockquote>
<p>Intrigued, I borrowed the book and took a look. As a resource for historians, the book is practically useless. (It may be best suited to, um, getting a sense of the archive?) There is no facsimile of the original documents; the translations are summaries, and in many instances, wrong. Worse still, some english "versions" of the documents are followed [sans distinction] with 'gloss' which borders on stream-of-consciousness and is often a gross reading of the primary text. </p>
<p>The introduction seems to want to pick up the gauntlet thrown by William Dalrymple's <i>Last Mughal</i> about Indian historians using the National Archives and reading the <i>shakista</i> sources and writing histories better than those by Bayly et al. This clearly is not that work - nationalist pride, aside.</p>
<p>All is not lost. There are two things of potential interest to the historian which I am  reproducing below the fold for the potential interest of said historians.<br />
