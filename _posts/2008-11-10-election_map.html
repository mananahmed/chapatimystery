  content: Hmm...I just found out that not only did the county where I'm registered
    go for Obama, so did the county in which my father was born, the county in which
    my mother was born, the county in which I was born, and the county where I'm physically
    residing right now.  Wow.

    County, CA (according to this map, by a difference of two points) when I expected
    it to be otherwise.   Orange County, on the other hand, was for McCain by
    4 points. No surprise there.   And check out Box Elder, UT and Campbell,
    WY: both 80% for McCain!"

  content: "Not every county with a major city.  A couple went for McCain: Maricopa
    County, Arizona (Phoenix) obviously went for McCain.  So did Duval County, Florida
    (Jacksonville).  And, er, actually, depending on how you count major cities, that
    might be it.  The counties with the next largest cities that went for McCain were
    Tarrant County, Texas (Fort Worth), Oklahoma County, Oklahoma (Oklahoma City),
    Fresno County, California (Fresno), Virginia Beach, Virginia (an independent city),
    Tulsa County, Oklahoma (Tulsa), and El Paso County, Colorado (Colorado Springs)
    - all pretty second tier cities.  The only counties with major professional
    sports franchises in them that Obama lost were Maricopa, Duval, and Tarrant, I
    think.  This is actually a significant change from 2004 - Bush in that year
    won San Diego County (San Diego), Hillsborough County (Tampa), Pinellas County
    (St. Petersburg), Dallas County (Dallas), Harris County (Houston), Bexar County
    (San Antonio), and Hamilton County (Cincinnati).  Obama won all those this year."

  content: "The NYT website has been clogged at various moments, but I was able to
    catch a couple of editorials. Cut and paste jobs for ya'll for your enjoyment:  <blockquote>We
    Apologize By NYTimes Editorial  Published: July 4th, 2009   The
    momentous occasion of the end of the war in Iraq also marks a time for reflection
    at The Times. As many of our readers have pointed out for years, this newspaper
    played no small part in making the case for the war in the first place, and in
    supporting the costly and deadly U.S. occupation of Iraq for five years &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    long after public opinion had turned against it.  We have in the past acknowledged
    botched reporting. In May 2006, we published an editors' note
    acknowledging no fewer than nine articles that uncritically repeated erroneous
    claims about W.M.D.s by anonymous officials.  Those admissions, we realize,
    didn't go nearly far enough. Notably, we failed to single out
    the instrumental role that Times reporter Judith Miller played in bringing unfounded
    W.M.D. allegations to a national audience.  Miller's
    prominent stories hyping purported Iraqi weapons go back to 1998, and were full
    of dramatic but unverified claims and unreliable sources. &ldquo;All
    of Iraq is one large storage facility&rdquo; for W.M.D.s, she credulously
    quoted one source (September 8, 2002). Miller systematically played down skepticism
    and conflicting evidence, both of which were readily available to any reporter.
    In so doing Miller lent crucial support to the Bush administration's
    agenda. It took Miller's involvement in the vengeful leak of
    a C.I.A. officer's name before we finally let her go &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    with a hefty severance package.  Even after this episode, we continued publishing
    articles based on claims by anonymous officials advancing unverified claims &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    this time, against Iran.  As for our opinion pages, what we passed off as
    &ldquo;debates&rdquo; on the Iraq war have consistently
    excluded the views of people with a track record of being right. Conversely, in
    January 2008, we boosted Bill Kristol's already considerable
    national platform by offering him a regular column. It is hard to say why.  As
    early as 1997, Kristol had penned a Weekly Standard cover story, &ldquo;Saddam
    Must Go,&rdquo; in which he and contributing editor Robert Kagan called
    for war against Iraq: &ldquo;We know it seems unthinkable to propose
    another ground attack to take Baghdad. But it's time to start
    thinking the unthinkable.&rdquo; They argued that Saddam Hussein had
    humiliated the United States by expelling U.S. officials from U.N. weapons inspection
    teams. The editorial cited unspecified sources about Iraq's
    chemical and biological weapons capabilities, and concluded with this dark warning:
    &ldquo;If you don't like this option, we've
    got another one for you: continue along the present course and get ready for the
    day when Saddam has biological and chemical weapons at the tips of missiles aimed
    at Israel and at American forces in the Gulf. That day may not be far off.&rdquo;  Why
    did we decide to reward Kristol for having been utterly &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and
    lethally &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; wrong on Iraq? We can't say for
    sure, but as of yesterday Mr. Kristol has been terminated as a columnist at The
    Times. In the same spirit, we also welcome Thomas Friedman's
    resignation.  Beginning today, you will see a giant overhaul of our paper,
    from the front page to this page, as, belatedly shouldering our responsibilities
    as the newspaper of record, we make a practice of hiring writers who get it right.  No
    related posts. </blockquote>  And Tom's little speech:  <blockquote>The
    End of the Experts? By Thomas J. Friedman  Published: July 4th, 2009  The
    sudden outbreak of peace in Iraq has made me realize, among other things, one
    incontestable fact: I have no business holding a pen, at least with intent to
    write.  I know, you're thinking I'm
    going too far. I haven't always been wrong about everything.
    I recently made some sense on global warming and what we needed to do about it,
    for instance.  But to have been so completely and fundamentally wrong about
    so huge a disaster as what we have done to Iraq &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and ourselves
    &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; is outrageous enough to prove that people like me have no
    business posing as wise men, and, more importantly, that The New York Times has
    no business continuing to provide me with a national platform.  In any case,
    I have made a decision: as of today, I will no longer write in this or any other
    newspaper. I will immediately desist from writing any more books about how it's
    time for everyone to climb on board the globalization high-speed monorail to the
    future. I will keep my opinions to myself. (My wife suggested that I try not to
    even form opinions, but I think she might have another agenda.)  Baffled?
    I don't blame you. So I'll cite some facts
    to support my decision &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a practice, I must admit, I have too
    seldom followed.  Let's start with the invasion itself.
    I was pretty much all for it. Mind you, I was not one of the pundits, reporters,
    or public figures who said that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States.
    I knew better &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but I said it didn't matter!  Back
    in February of 2003, I wrote in this space: &ldquo;Saddam does not
    threaten us today. He can be deterred. Taking him out is a war of choice &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    but it's a legitimate choice.&rdquo; In other words,
    we should invade a sovereign state and replace its government in order to remake
    the world more to our liking.  Now the simple fact is, an unprovoked attack
    on a sovereign state is a war crime, even when linked to grand ideas of the future
    of mankind. In fact, that's exactly what Hitler did, for exactly
    the same reasons. The Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal called it the &ldquo;the
    supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains
    within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&rdquo;  What
    was I thinking? And more importantly, why didn't anyone stop
    me?  But wait, it gets worse. Having expressed how acceptable it was to
    commit Hitler's signature crime, I then applauded the invasion
    of Iraq as an &ldquo;audacious roll of the dice.&rdquo;
    It should have occurred to me that this gamble would be unspeakably painful for
    an untold number of Iraqis who had done nothing to us &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; in
    other words, any of them.  Soon, when it became obvious that my pipe dreams
    for a peaceful and democratic subject nation were just that, I decided to say
    it was too soon to tell how things would turn out in Iraq, but that we would definitely
    know in six months to a year. I said this pretty much every six months for five
    years. And The Times just kept giving me more and more column-inches.  I'm
    not trying to beat myself up here. I've done that plenty already,
    believe me &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; and my wife has done the rest! But I have one
    question: why are newspapers like The New York Times letting people like me make
    fools of themselves, mislead the American people, and, worst of all, give their
    wives a lifetime of ammunition?  To err is human, but to print, reprint,
    and re-reprint error-mad humans like me is a criminally moronic editorial policy.  Nor,
    of course, is it only me. Just consider who populates the opinion pages of America's
    top newspapers. Bill Kristol, who was actually hired by The Times long after being
    proven wrong on Iraq. Charles Krauthammer. Robert Novak. Mona Charen. Fred Barnes.
    The list goes on and on of officially-approved wise men (and a woman or two) who
    never once doubted that Iraq had vast stockpiles of W.M.D.s. And that's
    just in newspapers.  We were all wrong again and again &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    and the consequences were devastating. Can anyone tell me why any of us should
    ever be asked, let alone paid, for our opinions ever again? Or, for that matter,
    why Richard Perle or Paul Wolfowitz should be allowed behind any sort of desk
    whatsoever as long as they live?  Peace in Iraq will undoubtedly have many
    far-reaching consequences. As promised, I'm not going to speculate
    publicly about what they might be.  Except one. As of today, I'm
    putting down my pen, to take up a screwdriver. I am going to retrain as an engineer
    and spend the rest of my life working to build non-carbon-based energy technologies.
    And I'm going to spend a lot of time washing my hands.  No
    related posts. </blockquote>"
