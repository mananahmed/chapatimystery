  content: 'I haven''t read the Saikia book yet, but the quote on why 1971 wasn''t
    genocide -- "This was distinct from the violence committed by Nazis against Jews.
    Jews were not a political or military threat to Germany. They were killed solely
    because of their ethnoreligious identity." -- is most odd.  Saikia seems to be
    adopting some kind of "objective" test as to whether or not the targeted Other
    posed a real threat -- ignoring that in genocidal rhetoric, symbolism, and psychology,
    the targeted Other ALWAYS poses a threat.  Stated differently, it isn''t as if
    the Nazis sat around saying to each other "The Jews pose no threat to us, but
    we''re going to kill them because we hate Jews" -- on the contrary, the Nazis
    (and not only the Nazis, but a vast swathe of more or less respectable right-wing
    opinion) believed that "Jewish money", "Jewish influence", "Jews" etc. constituted
    a threat to Germans, German-ness etc.  The point isn''t that 1971 needs the G-word
    to be condemned (I especially liked the point you made about how respectable victimhood
    needs the G-word to truly cash in, the G-word serving as the shield beyond which
    no further thought is necessary), but that there would be no genocide if this
    standard were applied.  I don''t know if she considers Rwanda (itself a far more
    apt analogy to, e.g. the 1946-47 violence in the sub-continent, and perhaps 1971,
    than the Nazi extermination drives), but that presents the logic of genocides
    in an especially naked form: contrary to the Saikia quote, I would argue that
    in fact, the scale at which credible genocidal attempts need to occur means that
    they are ONLY justified, populations can ONLY be mobilized, if the targeted other
    is presented as posing an existential threat (in a classic case of projection)
    -- it isn''t surprising that virtually all of the mass killings that are susceptible
    to the G-word (the Nazi exterminations; Rwanda etc.) occur in the context of a
    war, when, presumably, such representations become even more plausible.  [The
    Nazis in fact confirm this thesis: they were always repugnant anti-Semitic bigots,
    but they weren''t killing millions of civilians until the war occurred.  So too
    with Rwanda, where the genocide occurred against a backdrop of conflict with the
    RPF, the situation in Burundi, etc.]'

  content: "Thanks Q. Saikia's discussion on what to call the violence in 1971 is
    rather brief (and I think, rightly so) wherein she touches on Rwanda and Nazi
    Holocaust as the two 'models' of genocide: \"The processing required for committing
    genocide can be an 'industrial' production that occurred in Nazi Germany, or genocidal
    violence can occur within communities that share intimate and passionate relationships,
    as in the case of Rwanda and Bosnia.\" Out of these two 'models,' she suggests
    that East Pakistan doesn't fit the first, but resembles the second. She says that
    genocide is strategically used to establish its perpetrators' power, who \"define
    the event through their motivation to willfully destroy and annihilate the victim
    community that they define as different from them.\" With that in mind, she asks
    whether the Pakistani soldiers thought they were committing genocide, and suggests
    that \"the violence of the Pakistan Army was driven by the desire and motivation
    to save Pakistan and make the Begalis submit.\" I read that as her drawing a distinction
    between domination and annihilation, in terms of objectives.    Then she
    presents the concept of 'politicide' (&ldquo;political issues lead
    to mass murder of communal victims&rdquo;) that scholars of genocide
    studies have put forth. That, it seems to me, more aptly describes the violence
    of 71, as well as the cases of violence recognized as genocide, since, as you
    said, \"the scale at which credible genocidal attempts need to occur means that
    they are ONLY justified, populations can ONLY be mobilized, if the targeted other
    is presented as posing an existential threat (in a classic case of projection)
    &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it isn't surprising that virtually all
    of the mass killings that are susceptible to the G-word (the Nazi exterminations;
    Rwanda etc.) occur in the context of a war, when, presumably, such representations
    become even more plausible.\" She mentions that the list of perpetrators of violence
    in East Pakistan included Bengalis, Biharis, Pakistanis and Indians, and asks
    whether we should conclude that there were multiple genocides. With this discussion
    on the indeterminacy of the term and some brief detailing of politics of labeling
    the violence (something that I have tried to hint at throughout the series), she
    moves on to more interesting questions about violence regardless of how we label
    it.  That said, I find that quote perplexing. Whether or not Jews were *really*
    a political or military threat, they were perceived to be that. In hindsight,
    I probably shouldn't have removed my parenthetical remark to that effect."

  content: "Quick clarification. After quoting from my review of Sarmila Bose, Patwari
    asks \"Is that so?\" The reference is to my calculation that if the 3m figure
    is correct, it would require 11,000 deaths a day, making the 71 war one of the
    most lethal.   In case there are readers here who don't go back to my original
    piece, and conclude, from Patwari's question \"Is that so?\" that I accept the
    3m figure, well, I don't. I've gone on to say in my piece how such a figure exceeds
    known deaths in the DRC conflict, in the Rwandan conflict, and so on. So the 3m
    figure is not accurate, but then nor is it \"a few thousand,\" as Bose implies.
    It is entirely possible for a few hundred thousand to have died during the conflict,
    possibly less than half a million. But, as I argue at the end of my piece, the
    argument should not be about the numbers, nor about whether one should call it
    a \"genocide\". It was a grotesque crime against humanity, for which the Pakistani
    army bears the primary responsibility. The other side, as it were, didn't comprise
    of innocent angels, but the army wasn't made up of upright soldiers fighting for
    the honor of the country.   Just thought I should clarify, lest I appear
    to have accepted the 3m figure.   Thanks;  Salil Tripathi"

  content: "Thanks patwari... while I wait for my copy of her book, your comment/explanation
    of Saikia's point adds a lot of context, and makes a lot of sense...  To
    add to your (and Salil's) point, I definitely agree that the vulgarity of numbers
    ought to be eschewed just as much as the vulgarity of a G-fixation ought to be.
    \ Gujarat 2002 offers a great illustration: the massacre of \"only\" a couple
    thousand people is not generally associated with terms like \"genocide\" or \"ethnic
    cleansing\" -- but an examination of the rhetoric of cleansing/\"safaaya\", the
    incitement, the complicity of the state government, etc., reveal a pattern of
    great similarity with situations where far larger numbers have been killed; even
    if one doesn't want to unambiguously say that a \"genocide\" occurred, personally
    it's difficult for me to not describe the violence as \"genocidal\".  It feels
    qualitatively different from even some conflicts where more people might have
    died (e.g. Kashmir; or the Pakistani actions in NWFP).  [I stress, not \"worse\"
    or \"better\" so much as \"different\".]"

  content: "Patwari: I think one other way to draw a distinction between those two
    \"models\" of genocide is that, where the Other to be killed without crime is
    an intimate Other, there is an erotic component to the violence, and a feeling
    of release/liberation, that might not be present where the we encounter the sort
    of \"industrial\" extermination the Nazis are known for.  In fact, in Eichman
    in Jerusalem, Arendt draws a(n) (implicit but useful) contrast, when she describes
    the orgy of anti-Jewish violence that broke out in Romania BEFORE the Nazis could
    begin the transport/segregation etc. that served as preparatory work for the death
    camps.  She cites Nazi correspondence expressing great disgust/distaste for the
    Romanian attitude, as it wasn't civilized.  That is, the Nazis (a bit like the
    army officer referenced in Saikia's book/your piece), or at least A strong undercurrent
    in the Nazi attitude, saw this as dirty, distasteful work -- and then took pride
    in the fact that they were up to the job (in turn legitimizing the dirty deed:
    \"hey, you're doing some good even if you feel sick -- you're demonstrating you've
    got the spine to do what's needed\").  To exult in it struck more than one as
    barbaric, as confusing the necessary work that history had placed on the shoulders
    of the Germans (and that others were too craven or hypocritical to carry out)
    with mindless killing.  That seems to me to be the more important distinction,
    rather than whether one is genocide and the other isn't.  [As you've explained,
    doesn't seem like Saikia would disagree either.]  Aside: Based on my experience
    of the USA, however, one problem is that only the former -- i.e. the \"industrialized\"
    slaughter -- is recognized as genocide; the other \"model\", the sheer messiness
    of the other \"model\", is banished to anthropology of the \"age-old ethnic hatreds\"
    sort.  In turn incentivizing the desperate race by activists to shoe-horn \"their\"
    particular mass killings into the neat categories of the Nazi paradigm..."

  content: "Thanks for reading, Salil. I didn't mean to suggest that you accept the
    3m estimate, but I can see how it can be read that way. Thanks for the clarification.
    Also, I look forward to your upcoming book on the subject.   Your point
    about the army not being made up of \"upright soldiers fighting for the honor
    of the country,\" is somewhat misplaced, I think. It seems to suggest that the
    soldiers in East Pakistan went astray. Bose, too, takes that line, the difference
    being that she contends that it was &ldquo;one or two companies of
    a single regiment.&rdquo; How does one determine whether or not they
    were fighting for the honor of their nation? For all I know, they must have thought
    that they were doing just that. My argument is that whether or not they were upright
    soldiers fighting for the honor of the country is irrelevant. Upright soldiers,
    nice people, family-men, loving fathers, and so on, do commit grotesque violence,
    or at least, go along with it.    \"Bose mentions the soldier who helped
    the boy get a pardon and that some soldiers had tears rolling down their cheeks
    as the massacre unfolded. That may be, and there is much good in representations
    that humanize soldiers, but what needs to be highlighted is the fact that they
    still went along and assisted in the cruelty that so troubles them, moves them
    to tears, and, at least in some cases, haunts them for the rest of their lives.
    One explanation for that may be the militarist nationalism that idolizes the military
    and puts the defense of a nation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;always deemed under siege
    from enemies without and within&acirc;&euro;&rdquo; at the forefront of national
    self-hood. Another explanation is the very institution of military that has at
    its core obedience, hierarchy, and killing which is writ large when it is unrestrained
    by public scrutiny and accountability.\"  {{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/towards_1971_iii_a_few_good_pakistani_men.html"

  content: "Last week David Armitage gave a talk here at Rice about civil war: what
    is it? how do we (by \"we,\" he meant those largely experiencing civil conflict
    within a western tradition) define it? I liked the talk because it was inconclusive.
    The takeaway: something like \"civil war\" is notoriously difficult to define.
    It is often described with the benefit of hindsight for political purposes. Armitage
    pointed to political scientists, who in the late 1980s actually came up with a
    definition: a civil war had to, among other criteria, encompass at least 1000
    battlefield deaths per year. The audience of historians laughed. We could all
    see the difficulties of counting deaths per year, especially those that were supposed
    to be limited to a \"battlefield.\"  Civil War is perhaps like genocide.
    It is difficult to say what it is, precisely, but we know it when we see it (apologies
    to Potter Stewart). Trying to tie a definition to it, as to how like or unlike
    it was to the Holocaust, means the unseemly business of counting bodies, digging
    into motivations, peering into ethnic and religious conflict. It means the moment
    one thinks one has a workable definition of such an obscenity in one instance,
    the horror of another instance slips away in an orgy of numbers and factoids.  What
    I find encouraging about Saikia's efforts is her engagement with actual soldiers,
    especially those who now feel shame, remorse, and wonder how their other selves
    existed amidst atrocity. Perhaps the way in is not labeling 1971 as an either/or/perhaps
    kind of conflict. Instead I read into the bits that Patwari analyzed here the
    problems of being a part of an army attached to a modern state.  Chris Browning
    historicized the problem in his book Ordinary Men. How did the Nazi state coerce,
    or convince, ordinary German men to butcher Jews in Poland? His Afterword suggested
    that the answer lies in our existence in a world \"...in which war and racism
    are ubiquitious.\" \"....[T]he powers of government mobilization and legitimization
    are powerful and increasing, in which a sense of personal responsibility is increasingly
    attenuated by specialization and bureaucratization, and in which the peer group
    exerts termendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms. In such a world,
    I fear, modern governments that wish to commit mass murder will seldom fail in
    their efforts for being unable to induce 'ordinary men' to become their 'willing
    executioners.'\" (Browning, 223)  Patwari's question \"Will we let them
    speak? Will we listen?\" is particularly germane if we realize that the possibility
    and desirability of genocide is a characteristic of the modern nation-state."

  content: "Regarding numbers (a vulgar obsession admittedly yet not irrelevant),
    here is a footnote from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/War-Secession-Pakistan-Creation-Bangladesh/dp/0520076656\"
    rel=\"nofollow\"><i>War and Secession: Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh</i></a>
    by Richard Sisson, Leo Rose: <blockquote> India set the number of victims
    of Pakistani atrocities at three million, and this is still the figure usually
    cited. We interviewed two Indian officials who had held responsible positions
    on the issue of Bangladesh in 1971. When questioned about the actual number of
    deaths in Bangladesh attributable to the civil war, one replied \"about 300,000\".
    Then when he received a disapproving glance from his colleague, he changed this
    to \"300,000 to 500,000\". Regardless of the figure, this is a horrifying loss
    of life, but it is still impossible to get anything like reliable estimates as
    to (1) how many of these were \"liberation fighters\" killed in combat, (2) how
    many were Bihari Muslims and supporters of Pakistan killed by Bengali Muslims
    and (3) how many were killed by Pakistani, Indian, or Mukti Bahini fire and bombing
    during the hostilities. One thing is clear--the atrocities did not go just one
    way, through Bengali Muslims and Hindus were certainly the main victims. </blockquote>"

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>That three million perished in the 1971 conflict is widely stated around the world. Salil Tripathi <a href="http://www.livemint.com/2011/07/15202454/Subcontinental-drift.html">points</a> out that &ldquo;Killing three million people over 267 days amounts to nearly 11,000 deaths a day. That would make it one of the most lethal conflicts of all time.&rdquo; Is that so? Numerous scholars have concluded that the figure of three million is exaggerated and incorrect. Sarmila Bose contends that &ldquo;it is possible to estimate with reasonable confidence that 50,000 — 100,000 people perished in the conflict in East Pakistan in 1971, including combatants and non-combatants, Bengalis and non-Bengalis, Hindus and Muslims, Indians and Pakistanis.&rdquo; The Bangla Academy's district surveys, conducted between 1996 and 2001, Naeem Mohaiemen <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=205005">mentions</a>, also found the figure to be much lower.  However, the importance of establishing statistically sound estimate of casualties and other war-crimes notwithstanding, as Sarmila Bose points out, there is no magical number of dead that needs to be hit before one can refer to a mass killing with the historically charged label of genocide.</p>
<p>The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/genocide.html">states</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:<br />
<!--more--><br />
(a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is this definition with which Bose contends that the Pakistan Army's violence in Bangladesh cannot be termed as genocide of Bengalis, but Bengali violence on Biharis can be. Bose claims that since Pakistan Army could not differentiate among Bengalis as to who was pro-liberation and who was pro-Pakistan, it used &ldquo;proxies&rdquo; or &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; to target people of a certain occupation (police), or political affiliation (membership of Awami League), age (adult), gender (in Bose's reckoning male, but not female!), and religion (Hindu) and therefore engaged in &ldquo;political killing.&rdquo; She does not accord the same logic of profiling to the killings of Biharis, which she contends had to do with the narrow ethno-linguistic nationalism and xenophobia of Bengalis.</p>
<p>Bose does state that the killings of Bengali Hindus simply for being Hindus &ldquo;<em>could be</em> [my emphasis] termed genocidal by their nature&rdquo; but then mentions that the Pakistan Army left many unharmed, as if that somehow dilutes the genocidal nature of violence unleashed upon Hindus. She mentions that Hindus were attacked, looted, and hounded by Bengalis too, which is apparently the case from the evidence she presents. However, the war being waged by Pakistanis on Hindu 'subversives' and their 'Hindu-like' accomplices in Bengal is surely the overarching concern, and a key factor even in Bengali violence on Hindus since that is the broader context that animated the violence in Bangladesh in 1971. That India encouraged the migration of Hindu refugees from Bengal who were imagined as future &ldquo;good citizens,&rdquo; (but not Muslim refugees) also went into the making of Hindu exodus, which she correctly names as 'ethnic cleansing' of Hindus, but one that went hand in hand with the genocidal attack on Hindus.<!--more--></p>
<p>Saikia, too, contends, that &ldquo;it is not possible to establish that the Bangladesh case was genocide.&rdquo; Violence in East Pakistan was not produced in death factories but as passionate episodes of violence responding to a previous outbreak of violence. This violence happened between and within communities. The perpetrators were driven by a multitude of motives ranging from group interest, politics, revenge, greed, and opportunism. Saikia advances another term, &ldquo;Politicide,&rdquo; whereby &ldquo;political issues lead to mass murder of communal victims,&rdquo; as an alternative to genocide.  Since the violence in 1971 was carried out on groups based on political terms, Saikia posits:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was distinct from the violence committed by Nazis against Jews. Jews were not a political or military threat to Germany. They were killed solely because of their ethnoreligious identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>(However, it seems that this methodology remains locked in a frame that takes the Nazi Holocaust as the standard with which every atrocity is compared to determine its station on the morbid hierarchy of misery.)</p>
<p>Remembering the dead as numbers is dehumanizing, and terminological labels have an effect of exceptionalizing violence and evil. Rather than being tied up with what terminology best describes the violence of 1971, Saikia brings our attention to the fact that common people committed atrocities as they took sides with ethnic or political groups and that &ldquo;it is almost impossible to distinguish victims from perpetrators.&rdquo; Pakistani military administrators, Indian politicians, Bengali leaders, and those following the aforesaid classes</p>
<blockquote><p>reduced their enemies into abstract numbers and demographic units, categorizing <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>. The abstraction of humans to fit ethnic, religious, and national labels opened the space for a cold, inhuman purpose for one human being to violate another human being. Bounded communities saw themselves as enemies of other bounded communities.</p></blockquote>
<p>A diverse population was reduced to mere labels — such as Hindu, 'Hindu-like' Bengali, Indian agent, Bihari, razakar and collaborator — and violence unleashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.mediabangladesh.net/en/img/morfeoshow/independence-8717/big/houserubble-bangladesh-1971.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="300" />Perhaps the most important insight to emerge from a critical examination of the 1971 war and the consequent partition, is the need to recognize and affirm our shared humanity with the Other, which breaks down in times of conflict. Unable to see the Other except through de-contextualized and homogenized social identities, we are then left with no other vocabularies than the ones coughed up by ideologies of war. We reduce each other to mere labels as the contest for power plays out and the society brutalized. Saikia writes about Pakistani military officials like Amin and Alam who refused to see themselves as perpetrators of violence, and explained away their violence as normal. They considered themselves to have been merely performing their duty to "clean Pakistan of the betrayers, the Bengalis."</p>
<p>Saikia documents dissenting, and repentant officers as well, to posit neither &ldquo;a banal idea that perpetrators and victims deserve similar understanding,&rdquo; nor that the perpetrators' taking responsibility of their acts exonerates them of their crimes. She does so to point out that the concept of <em>insaniyat</em> [humanity] gives us a vantage point from which to understand the complexities of violence, women's suffering, and perpetrators' obligations. She writes about Sahubzada Yaqub Khan, the chief commander of the Pakistan Army in the Eastern wing who sent telegrams to high command that a military solution was not acceptable and resigned after having failed to convince Yahya Khan to halt the military operation. She discusses her interaction with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=146348928749126&amp;id=100000839958157">Colonel Nadir Ali</a>, who went through a psychological breakdown during the war:</p>
<blockquote><p>His state of madness freed him, and he stopped playing the role of a soldier. Later, after regaining his equilibrium, he was able to recognize his and his 'enemies'' humanity and fill the empty space wracked by violence to develop speech and tell the story of war in his own language, Punjabi.</p></blockquote>
<p>She seeks out the lower cadre <em>jawans</em> and rank and file soldiers like Malik, who described himself as a &ldquo;troubled soul&rdquo; for the violence he saw his fellow soldiers commit, for not having done anything to stop his higher official from raping a woman as he stood guard at the door, and for looting Bengali villages to obtain food provisions for his company.</p>
<p>Whether or not there can be closure to what happened that fateful year in East Pakistan, and whether or not some form of reconciliation can occur between Bangladesh and Pakistan is a separate matter. What needs to happen first and foremost is the acknowledgement of violence and recognition of the pain and misery of those that suffered. It is the narratives of the repenting perpetrators and their recognition of guilt that can bring some solace to the victims. Saikia highlights the case of men like Malik and Nadir Ali, who &ldquo;being haunted by the memory of the Other&rdquo; tell their crimes, and by that speech-act</p>
<blockquote><p>deliver a justice to their victims that no tribunal, state, or court of law can deliver, and in that same gesture they make us aware that their existence as human rests on the Other. The perpetrator realizes that he owes his life as a human to another, his victim, whom he tried to destroy. This is the story that history cannot speak, the truth lies with the survivors — perpetrators and victims — who let us enter a murky world of memories and show us the possibility of moving beyond it towards closure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The denial of their own violence exists in the three sub-continental nation-states — a willed collective amnesia regarding 1971 that is constructed through nationalist narratives, be it the Bengali betrayal for Pakistan, the innocent victim-warrior mukti-jodha for Bangladesh, or the savior, white knight triumphalism for India. But if we are to break the cycle of violence, a space needs to be opened up for people like Mohammad, a Pakistani soldier who sought Saikia out to tell her his story, and how he was told that Bengalis had killed a large number of Biharis and was sent to raze a Bengali town. Mohammad pleads that &ldquo;it is important that Pakistan and Bangladesh governments must talk. I am ready to testify to my victims in Bangladesh and seek their understanding and forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will we let them speak? Will we listen?</p>

<p>Sepoy <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/we_are_all_ahmadis_iv_a_history.html">pointed out</a> that &ldquo;The Bengal question cleaved Pakistan into two. This second Partition gave rise to the first outright embrace of the process of Islamization under the leadership of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.&rdquo; Bhutto gained unrestrained power over Pakistan in the aftermath of the war of 1971 that nevertheless was no match for his megalomania. He turned Pakistan away from the ambit of South Asian politics and towards the Middle East. In efforts to please the Saudi regime and bolster his own flagging legitimacy, Bhutto <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/we_are_all_ahmadis_vi_community.html">pandered</a> to its Pakistani Islamist allies and declared <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/an_abandoned_man.html">Ahmadis</a> non-Muslim. He unleashed the disgraced Pakistan military on Baluchistan in 1974 in a campaign that earned the butcher of Bengal, General Tikka Khan, the epithet Butcher of Baluchistan, and gave the Pakistan military a second lease on life. Bhutto's pet, General Zia, in due time, overthrew his ever authoritarian government in a military coup, and went on to enhance, build on, and focus the processes of Islamizing the state &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; what Sepoy calls the <a href="http://platypus1917.org/2010/02/18/strict-interpretations/#_ftn2">Sunnification</a> of Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Sunnification of the state and society of Pakistan dovetailed with America's Jihad on the &ldquo;godless communists&rdquo; and the &ldquo;evil empire,&rdquo; and is evident in and constructed through (among other deplorable policies and actions) not only the introduction of blasphemy laws to criminalize Ahmadiyyat in Pakistan but also by supporting and enabling anti-Shia militias to crush Iran's imagined allies among the Pakistani Shia as part of both America's and Saudi Arabia's not so cold war with Iran. These developments accompanied decrees to police women. And so it was that, in Saadia Toor's words,</p>
<blockquote><p>within the discourse of the regime, the terms momin ('pious Muslim') or mard-i-momin ('pious Muslim man') became synonymous with the normative citizen, with predictable implications for women and non-Muslims. Accordingly, the new legal/constitutional regime distinguished between Muslims and non-Muslims, between women and men, and between Muslim women and Muslim men, with pious Muslim (Sunni) male emerging as the only true subject of rights and privileges and all others being relegated to the status of second class citizens.&rdquo; ((Toor, 2011, p136))</p></blockquote>
<p>The military junta, unaccountable to the civilian government, is the shadow government of Pakistan with tentacles deep in Pakistan's culture, politics, and economy. Its commercial empire, what scholar Ayesha Siddiqa has dubbed 'Milbus,' (( Ayesha Siddiqa, Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy, Pluto Press, 2007)) is maintained at the cost of education, healthcare, basic rights, and a democratic society. Erasure of inconvenient episodes of history from memory is vital to this mutually re-enforcing relationship between steadily escalating militarization and a narrowing vision of what the State of Pakistan is and can be.</p>
