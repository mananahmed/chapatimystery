<p>Lahore, should you be curious, is a food-lover's paradise. The traditional North Indian cuisines (your biryanis and your karahis and whatnot) get augmented with Sindhi and Pashtun varieties of preparation and serving. Various streets and muhallahs (neighborhoods) are famous for various types of foods. I didn't sample anything, this trip. The most daring I got was an order of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?ss=2&ct=6&w=all&q=halwa+puri+lahore&m=text">Halwa Puri</a> for breakfast which did not agree with me. At all.</p>
<p>The streets of Lahore teem with vendors. There is always the corn guy in front of the school, the kulfi guy at the corner, the channa/dal guy, the sugarcane guy, the milk-with-almonds guy, and the fruit guy.</p>

<p>I didn't partake from any of them. I was at home, busy with the wedding. Here is my lovely mother doing her usual lunches (I kid) and the bride and groom (on Mehndi night) hoping to get some food.</p>
