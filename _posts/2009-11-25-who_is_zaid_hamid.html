  content: "His fans would be well advised to do what the man says: read, research.
    If they do, they will find that the whole third tower theory has been debunked.
    His fan following appears to have been lulled into complacency, confident that
    listening to what he says makes up for any research they could have done. He does
    mix some facts into his fiction, which helps with the complacency. \r\n\r\nOne
    thing several people have told me is that they are attracted to him because of
    his \"personality\". This usually translates to the green eyes, light skin, red
    cap covering up the receding hair that nevertheless hangs fashionably long at
    the back, and command of English. This should not be underestimated. We Pakistanis
    are suckers for these things."

    cocktail, of course.

  content: "It must be said, however, that he is tapping into a deep wellspring of
    despair and disillusionment... I arrived in the US three years ago, and haven't
    had to encounter the 12-hour load shedding and the inflation and governmental
    ineptitude and bombings, and can sort of see why the youth are flocking to his
    banner in droves... in their desperation for an alternative, a lot of people have
    taken his bait... \r\n\r\nThe Ali Azmat video should serve as a wakeup call...
    people like him and Imran Khan and Ahmed Qureshi will only win more converts like
    Azmat if the government continues to shoot itself in the foot... Hamid and Qureshi
    and Khan kept going on about the lavish lifestyles of the ruling elite, the load
    shedding, the shady defense deals, the corruption, the creaking judicial system,
    and it is hard to disagree that all this needs to change, and fast...  what is
    needed is a charismatic, populist alternative from the liberal/left side of the
    spectrum, who can highlight the ridiculousness and bigotry of some of Hamid's
    arguments on the one hand and speak out for reform (not revolution), something
    that has been ceded to the likes of Hamid and Khan...\r\n\r\nBut who could serve
    that role? NFP has mellowed significantly, and he and the likes of Fasi Zaka speak
    only to a tiny audience that continues to shrink, as the NYT video showed... the
    level-headed writers in Dawn and Daily Times suffer from the same problem... Pervez
    Hoodbhoy, for all his erudition, lacks the populist charm and charisma that Hamid
    possesses...\r\n\r\nAitzaz Ahsan, perhaps?"

  content: "More ZaidHamidisms:\r\nWhat Balochi rights? They say that Balochi land
    is their mother; well they sold their mother to Oman. What gas? Punjab provides
    grain and agriculture products to all of the country. Should Punjab say, no, this
    is my resource and not the country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s? Why did Balochis celebrate
    Independence on 15th August? (Suggesting that their 15th August celebration was
    a celebration of India's Independence). This insinuation came at the heels of
    \"India is funding BLA Terrorists.\" There was no mention of Kalat's declaration
    of Independence. In fact there was no mention of Kalat at all or what was Balochistan
    pre-Pakistan or what is contemporary Balochistan other than part of the acronym
    BLA.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, he asserted that CIA had something to do with
    the lawyer's movement.\r\n\r\nQardawi, from what I have read about him, has some
    religious credentials in terms of training and following. Zaid Hamid seems to
    be peddling some blend of Pakistani religious nationalism, with a pan-Islamic
    political focus vis-&Atilde;&nbsp;-vis foreign policy. He also wishes to ignite
    a spirit of self confidence and spiritual quest in Pakistanis, by claiming to
    have found a hadith that says the army that conquers Hind will also conquer the
    Holy land. Someone said, well that has already happened. He replied that that
    army conquered the Holy land first and later turned their attention towards Hind
    and his interpretation is that the Hadith is about the army that will conquer
    Hind first and then go to the Holy land. This assertion came at the back of the
    story about Zaid Hamid being on Hajj/Umra and meeting a Palestinian family. The
    Palestinian family was very pleased that he is from Pakistan, and according to
    him, said that they know that it would eventually be Pakistani forces that will
    liberate Palestine. He also managed to keep Zia's role in Black September out
    of his narrative and his \"concern\" for Palestinians and any mention of Palestinians
    was through the Zaid Hamid lens of what Zionists and Free Masons were doing to
    Palestinians. In that narrative Palestinians don't exist in any role other than
    faceless and nameless victims of \"evil ideology\". This ignorance of Palestinian
    society or politics is convenient both for his audience and for him, because no
    one needs to do any reading or make an effort towards getting to know any aspect
    of Palestinian nationalism/politics/society. Also by not portraying Palestinians
    as a unique/distinct people or discussing what makes them a distinct nation, the
    Palestinian becomes yet another example of an under-assault/oppressed Muslim with
    that being his only attribute. In the same manner Kashmiris, Chechens, Iraqis,
    Afghanis etc are added to the list of Zaid hamid's indifferentiable homogenous
    oppressed Muslims.\r\n\r\nHis discussion of Dagestan was hilarious as well. Mountain
    people of Dagestan are so \"haseen,\" tall, broad, and handsome, that you would
    think that they are Devs(giants). His episode on Imam Shamil also had an action
    sequence in it where Imam Shamil jumps over some Russian soldiers after being
    stabbed in his abdomen with a sword. So the style of presentation is that of an
    old grand parent telling stories about a bygone era with mythic heros, sort of
    an Amir Hamza saga (a childhood fav of mine - Muqbil Wafadar the archer, Amir
    Hamza, Umru Ayar, Lindhoor etc.) \r\n\r\nOh, and I think he also collaborates
    with Harun Yahya and might be claiming a pie in the creationist crowd as well."

  content: "Darn it, I shouldn't have taken out the disclaimer from my comment, i.e.
    I'll have to be paid to watch his videos :)\r\n\r\nI'll try to find the video
    where he mentions the Hadith, but I think it was titled something to the tune
    of \"spiritual forces\" aired in 2008, and unlike his usual cute chick asking
    pre-drafted questions, this video had some audience as well. If I remember correctly,
    he talked about the need to develop a spiritual underpinning of politics/foreign
    policy on the lines of/like \"God gave Israel to Jews\" and then unveils the so-called
    \"Ghazva-e-Hind\" hadith.\r\n\r\nDon't know about who's funding him or if he has
    anything to do with ISI/ISPR, but if I remember correctly he claims to be a veteran
    \"volunteer\" of Afghan-Soviet war. Watch his Afghanistan video, and if I remember
    correctly he seemed to be claiming to have played a role in trying to open up
    a channel between Ahmed Shah Masood and Pakistan Army/government with the help
    of M.M Alam (the famed fighter pilot) suggesting contact between him and ISI.\r\n\r\nIt
    is my understanding that he produced the brass tack programs himself. Although,
    I recall seeing his picture with Harun Yahya ( http://tabsir.net/?p=979 ) on his
    website once, and wondering who the heck is that. Is there a link between him
    and Yahya? It might be that he is modelling himself and his \"scholarship\", and
    thus his enterprise on Harun Yahya's."

  content: I ve followed Mr. Zaid Hamid on TV for sometime. I ve never been a conspiracy
    theorist, however most of the stuff he speaks makes sense. Those of my friends
    who prefer to criticize Mr. Hamid do it while sitting outside Pakistan and without
    having to feel what the realities are on ground in Pakistan. If u ask a person
    on the street who has never even heard of Hamid, he would also give you similar
    feelings about US, Zionists and India. Its because so much mess has been created
    in Pakistan for last 30 years that the thought process invariably leads of conspiracies.
    As for my Indian friends, i only ask one thing. just look at two very unusual
    events in last decade, attack on Indian parliament in 2001 and Mumbai attacks
    in 2008, just see who benefited from these events, surely its India, Pakistan
    lost a lot. Agencies or Government in Pakistan could not have been so naive to
    shoot themselves in the foot. So? does it lead to a conspiracy theory? surely
    it does. If mr. Hamid is an ultra nationalist, thats great. Ultra nationalism
    is exactly what we require.

    it actually showed the weakness of Indian strategic thinking with the problems
    of Operation Parakaram that followed. I don't see much of benefits that flowed
    from the 2008 attacks either. If you think these were some how designed by an
    agency to benefit India, then that is indeed a conspiracy theory."

    if India did benefit from the attacks, that points to the political savvy of Indian

  content: "Re: \"I ve followed Mr. Zaid Hamid on TV for sometime. I ve never been
    a conspiracy theorist, however most of the stuff he speaks makes sense.\"\r\n\r\nI
    first came across \"Brass Tacks\" when someone sent me youtube links to a series
    he did on the world financial system etc. (one of the upshots was that the decision
    to leave the gold standard was a Jewish conspiracy).  And that's just one aspect
    of it.  Most of it certainly made no sense to me.\r\n\r\nI believe these were
    the episodes I saw:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MikFYbcJMg\r\n\r\nRe:
    \"Its because so much mess has been created in Pakistan for last 30 years that
    the thought process invariably leads of conspiracies. \"\r\n\r\nIt's the inevitability
    that one questions.  By this yardstick only conspiracies could explain Africa's
    Great lakes region.  The sad truth is that, as Arendt wisely observed in \"The
    Origins of Totalitarianism\", conspiracy theories are in fact re-assuring -- because
    they testify to a world where the old categories of good/evil, personal agency,
    etc. matter.  One matters in a world where the dominant system is geared toward
    crushing one.  The truly disorienting recognition is of a world where one is being
    crushed by a pitiless machine that just does not care."

  content: "Re: \"...just see who benefited from these events, surely its India, Pakistan
    lost a lot.\"\r\n\r\nA number of people told me in March that India stood to benefit
    from the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore, and hence that it must have
    been behind the attack.  I remember saying at the time that India would only be
    hurt by the attack -- confirmed by the IPL's relocation to South Africa (that
    it would coincide with the Indian elections was always known; it was only after
    the Lahore attacks that that became an issue; and after the New Zealand board
    made noises to the effect that it might not clear its players to play in India
    that season), and subsequent (lower-profile) cancellations such as the Australian
    Davis Cup team's tie in Chennai, or the English team pulling out of the world
    badminton championships in Hyderabad.  While I don't set all that much store by
    rationality (as Conrad noted on another thread, the rationality of a particular
    actor/group of actors might be different from our rationality; i.e. something
    is or is not rational depending on one's aims, worldview, agenda, etc.), the notion
    of \"who benefited\" is itself hardly self-evident (I personally think the Mumbai
    attacks damaged India, clearly demonstrating the ineptitude and creakiness of
    the state (which shouldn't have come as a surprise, but hey) to the very social
    groups/classes who had most invested in the self-image of a \"rising India\";
    and to the world at large.  The Congress government certainly was skillful in
    the AFTERMATH (far more so than the NDA was in 2001), not least (on the domestic
    front) in \"de-communalizing\" the aftermath, and admittedly (on the international
    front) aided by mind-boggling clumsiness by the Pakistani establishment, bordering
    on amateurishness -- but all the skillfulness in the world after the fact could
    not make up for the spectacle -- televised worldwide for three days -- of complete
    and utter Indian impotence in the face of a handful of armed gunmen.  I find the
    notion that these attacks benefited India to be ridiculous -- IMO, what people
    really mean when they say this is that because the Mumbai attacks harmed Pakistan's
    international standing and its civilian leadership (they certainly did), they
    MUST HAVE benefited India."

    about Raman's 'rebuttal' it is a typical rightwing criticism about US policy and
    Pakistan. There isn't anything much by the way of a 'conspiracy' theory, as he
    certainly doesn't say that ISI is sponsoring a 'global jihad' but that elements
    of Al Qaeda are being 'sheltered' in the NWFP - an arguable point but one hardly
    just raised by conspiracy theorists or extremists.\r\n\r\nThere is of course no
    dearth of conspiracy theorists and theories in India either; the problem is that
    many people have been tired of hearing them since the days of Indira Gandhi the
    old excuse of the 'foreign hand' whether it was meant to be the CIA, KGB, ISI
    blah, blah,blah. I remember one of my uncles, who was an activist as well as a
    professor at Calcutta university recounting how he was arrested twice in the space

    general anti-Americanism, Pakistanis should specifically reject the practice of
    extrajudicial killings. \r\n\r\nSuch focused opposition to mercenary activity
    will also put pressure on the Pakistani government to wage a clean war against
    terrorism, one that can win this ideological battle rather than generate more
    sympathy for the militant cause. \r\n\r\nPublic condemnations of Blackwater in
    this context will also give fillip to investigations into unconfirmed reports
    of extrajudicial killings (whether by army officers or local lashkars, it remains
    to be investigated) in Malakand in the wake of Operation Rah-i-Rast. \"\r\n...\r\n\"In
    the absence of a robust legal framework that can deal justly and proportionately
    with terrorists, extrajudicial killings will remain an attractive option for stakeholders
    in the war against terrorism. \r\n\r\nIn that event, Blackwater operatives, or
    the employees of other private security firms, working with the US and/or Pakistani
    militaries and intelligence agencies, will have cause to launch secret programmes
    in Pakistan. \r\n\r\nAnd as long as that happens, Taliban spokesmen will continue
    to find a scapegoat for their heinous attacks, winning public sympathy while pinning
    their crimes on other &acirc;&euro;&tilde;non-state actors&acirc;&euro;&trade;.

  content: "Is he popular among Indian Muslims or among Hindus and other religions
    as well? If there are Hindus who find him attractive then that would be further
    proof that if you hate America enough, you can love anyone who hates America.
    \r\nbtw, as far as \"lot of research\" is concerned, does your research support
    his contention that there will be a very violent war in India within the next
    few years (I think he also has some specific dates he has calculated using advanced
    esoteric knowledge) and at the end of this war the Pakistani flag will fly on
    Kolkata and Bangladesh and Pakistan will Unite to rule the new Muslim Empire in
    India? That probably sounds very attractive to some people, but I would point
    out that its only attractive if one believes that we and our friends and families
    will all be among the survivors (and remember he talks of millions to be killed)?
    \r\nJust curious."

  content: "Well well well, I believe the owner is this BLOG must be residing OUT
    OF PAKISTAN. Not strange, plus must be a part of 5 % privilege class (so called
    elites) - in urdu \"Parhay Likhay BUT unfortunately JAHIL).  And what the hell
    how much you know about GLEN BECK (right wing conservative NUT BAG), amazing.
    Are you really a Muslim (I don't mean MULLA) and if you are a PARSI or AGHA KHANI
    thats fine with me too. The BOTTOM LINE is if ZAID HAMID is trying to revive the
    youth of a country what the hell is your problem...this always happens when we
    solely base our knowledge on western media (which always give one sided view of
    the muslim world). \r\n\r\nI think before confronting anyone else, THINK  what
    you want to be the best for PAKISTAN, don't you want the current corrupt politicians
    to dragged out of Pakistan political scene, don't you want justice, don't you
    want someone to head Pakistan in true leadership (i am not trying to say he should
    be Zaid Hamid), see the current depressed minds of our youth and general population
    need someone who can at very least provide some hope (you will be dreaming if
    you bet on your current political system and culture where few families had been
    ruling Pakistan for quite a while now). And I don't know why don't provide hope
    instead of debating OK provide solution to the current Problems we as a nation
    is facing??? People like you (owner of CM) like to instigate debates and points
    fingers. \r\n\r\nAt this point in time we need a revolution which will free our
    mind and bring about the hope to achieve the greater good for our homeland. And
    it will be through the youth (NO MULLAH's NO Politicians) but youth of the country.
    And its started already. I am not cynical at all but sometimes you need to read
    between the lines, try to understand how and why historic events occurred in the
    way they occurred...(by the way I am NOT againts PARSI's nor AGHA KHANI's nor
    even our MEMON Bradiri not to mention out SECULAR minded elite). I just want you
    all to be patriotic to the country and spend time in spreading hope among all.
    \r\n\r\nZaid Hamid is just REMINDING us all how we can revive the nation (really
    in need) and how we can connect the current events unfolding geo-politically  around
    us will affect us all in the long run. It might be a picture from a different
    angle you may argue the presentation but Not the intention. If someone says follow
    your Prophet sunnah (P.B.U.H) whats wrong with that, if someone says follow the
    high ideals set forth by our leaders you made Pakistan whats wrong with that,
    if someone says WAKEUP look around and analyze whats going on around outside our
    borders whats wrong with that. So think and respond to Zaid Hamid's imperfections
    by providing an alternative (NOT TANQEED BARA-E-TANQEED)"

    Ditto for Delhi. Well, how do you think that flag will get there without a war?
    Is that the sensible and desirable future we are supposed to get after we get
    rid of \"corrupt leadership\"? He also claims that a massive international Jewish
    free-mason conspiracy is trying to destroy Pakistan and on various occasions he
    has labeled most politicians and the leaders of the lawyers movement as agents
    of this conspiracy. And what is his plan for getting rid of these agents and their
    satanic system? If you think that is the way forward to peace and progress, you

    like drugs, its addictive, makes one feel good and euphoric.\r\n\r\nNobody in
    India had even heard of him until his videos appreared everywhere after 26-11
    claiming the 'hindu faced' ajmal kasab is a sikh called amar singh, all wrapped
    in the blatant but attractive lie that some dalits and christians in the indian
    intelligence community had told him so :) some indians have developed a morbid
    curiocity, a perverse sense of humor for this guy. popular in india? huh! we think
    he is a bigot of the first order and we hope he takes his followers where he's
    taking them and where they deserve to be.\r\n\r\nAny reasonable pakistani knows

    and Sunnah If what he said is aginst that reject it else accept it..so that discussion
    that who is zaid hamid and what are his ideas are pointless..To me he is my Leader...
    a good Muslim...a Patriot..He may be better than many of us..and if u r living

    , all i concluded is that Zaid Hamid is doing a greatd job ,inspiring the nation
    and giving the youth of pakistan a plate form to manipulate their feelings and
    implying them ! he is not ( in no mean) emotionally black mailing any one of his
    followers nor is he waging war against any of the world nation . All of his facts
    and figures are baised upon ground realities all that he is doing is to bring
    forward the truth . if anyone has a problem with his ideas then better not listen
    ! it is easy to criticise than to do the actuall work !!!

    nationalism has something to do with the use of the term Urdu-speaking for people
    who migrated to Pakistan, not necessarily because of nationalism, but rather a
    response to it in not wanting to identify oneself as an \"outsider.\" Am I reading
    too much into it? \r\nMy folks use the two terms alternatively without a thought.
    Muhajir, though is one term that I have never used or heard my folks use to refer

    that I have met, do identify themselves as Muhajirs."

    folks use the latter term, but that younger ones use the former.  And this isn't
    necessarily correlated with any sympathy for the MQM or for \"Muhajir politics\",
    but almost as a straight \"ethnic\" term, analogous to \"Sindhi\" or \"Punjabi\".
    As you note, the \"when they need to\" is always an implicit issue (hence people
    who migrated from East Punjab to West Punjab aren't ever called \"Muhajirs\",
    they are indistinguishable from Punjabis-in-general -- this only becomes an issue
    because the \"native\" and the \"outsider\" in the case of Urdu-speaking migrants
    mapped to different group identities (Sindhi and Urdu-speaking), and hence demography
    became an issue (if I'm not mistaken, there hasn't been a census of Sindh since
    1981)..."

  content: "Qalandar, I agree with you about Zaid Hamid type thinking (not the individual
    person, who is a buffoon whose time will soon be up) being a bigger threat than
    the taliban.  A good friend who is far more sagacious than me recently wrote:
    \"I think that the jihadis are a self-limiting phenomenon for various reasons,
    and have reached their limit. However, that is not the case for two other less
    violent but just as regressive groups in the population: The religious fundamentalists
    and the India-haters. These groups, I fear, will grow unless they are opposed
    with pro-active positive strategies.\"\r\nMy worst fear is that this way of thinking
    (Zaid Hamid as well as milder versions of anti-Indian Pakistani nationalism) MAY
    develop a momentum of its own,  causing real decision makers (not just students
    and academics with zero influence) to get carried away,  initially just going
    along because they are cynical and dont take the nonsense too seriously and regard
    it as useful propaganda,  and end up in a real war with India.  I am sure most
    readers of this august blog will find this a very silly fear and I too do not
    regard it as the LIKELY scenario, just a possible one...but its a very scary one.
    ..and its not our of the question because Pakistan is in the midst of a serious
    crisis (whether you wish to assign the blame on evil imperialists or anyone else
    is not the issue for this discussion,  whatever the cause, the crisis is real)
    and populations in crisis are not always known to make the rational choice...."

    I would humbly suggest that you reflect again on your religion and that of your
    forefathers.   Zaid Hamid is a manifestation of extreme bigotry and hatred.    He
    is playing on people's disillusion and frustrations that has built up over the
    last several decades.  In no way does he represent Pakistanis or muslims in general.  However
    he is beginning to fool enough people that he should be taken as seriously as
    Hizb e Tahrir.   More extremism will just increase our troubles no end.    Gaza,
    Venezuela, North Korea, Afghanistan and Iran are not good role models for Pakistan.   Look
    at the state of their people.   I know that there is a lot of frustration and
    things are bad but I don't think Pakistanis are prepared to lose their senses.  And
    also, we can't but help hearing Zaid Hamid's rants courtesy of AagTV etc so please
    don't say people don't know what he is talking about.

  content: The views  of zaid hamid reflect the situation which are going to face.
    He is doing marvelous job by reminding our youth the past of muslim history. he
    is inciting the youth towards the tru spirit of islam and exposing the conspiracy
    hatched by zionists and hindues. We all should want islamic ecnomic system not
    the riba based system. i am proud of his efforts. some people are criticising
    him because they do not want that ismalic system prevail in  our country.

    economically strong and last thing Pakistan needs is a war. Living with stone

    Gulf countries, they know how to develop economy. Pakistan is living in fools

    muslims (Pakistanis) think it as real."

  content: In my opinion, Zaid Hamid got some inspiration from SYED JAMALUDDIN, writer
    of "DIVIDE PAKISTAN TO ELIMINATE TERRORISM" who advocates disintegration of Pakistan
    on the basis of his own arguments which deal with brain-washing of youth by the
    religious forces in Pakistan and the discriminatory attitude of Pakistan&Acirc;&acute;s
    army towards Balochs, Pathans, Urdu speaking people and Sindhis. SYED JAMALUDDIN
    has proposed disintegration of Pakistan and making of 6 states in place of Pakistan.
    I feel that Zaid Hamid has tried to counter the arguments of SYED JAMALUDDIN by
    advocating Pakistan&Acirc;&acute;s ideology under the banner of WAKE UP PAKISTAN.
    Zaid Hamid has now tried to confront Syed Jamaluddin because CNN had aired advertisement
    of Syed Jamaluddin&Acirc;&acute;s book for two months in 2007. Most prominent
    Indian newspaper TIMES OF INDIA first reported about this CNN advertisement which
    also opened eyes of people like Zaid Hamid. I guess, Zaid Hamid has not yet responded
    to the arguments of Syed Jamaluddin and has relied on the rhetorics of nationalism
    without actually mentioning the reason about making of Bangladesh. Zaid Hamid
    calls making of Bangladesh as "breaking of Pakistan&Acirc;&acute;s one hand".
    He does not say more than this. The question is "Is Bangladesh not a Muslim country"?
    If yes, how can Zaid Hamid establish that Pakistan&Acirc;&acute;s disintegration
    was a zionist conspiracy. There are so  many other contradictions in Zaid Hamid&Acirc;&acute;s
    arguments. In simple words, Zaid Hamid can impress a crowd of less educated students
    but cannot match a guy like SYED JAMALUDDIN who is known by the whole world as
    a political analyst. Zaid Hamid is out there to compete with Syed Jamaluddin and
    nothing else. Zaid Hamid is suffering from certain "complex".

  content: "\"Syed\" Jamaluddin is a defector of Pakistan. According to Pakistan's
    constitution any schemes of defection, disintegration is punishable by death.
    Pakistan is not alone in this regard. US routinely executes her own defectors.
    I simply don't understand why someone has the need to shoot themselves in the
    foot. To talk of the disintegration of Pakistan instead of improving it. Why all
    these outclass \"leaders\" talk of separation right of the bat instead of giving
    unity of Pakistan a chance? Defectors like Mujib, Bugti and others talk of balkanizing
    Pakistan.\r\n\r\nAfter years and years of hopelessness, Allah(swt) has gifted
    Pakistan another opportunity. This opportunity is brought in the form of Zaid
    Hamid. By following his vision of Pakistan (which was the originally intended
    vision), we can reclaim our destiny which was envisioned by our respectable founder,
    MA Jinnah.\r\n\r\nWhy do you guys choose to put a blindfold on your eyes? You
    reject Zaid and Ahmed Quraishi when they  work hard in exposing those actions
    that these \"actors\" are doing their very best to hide. You reject them as conspiracy
    theorists. But you don't, for a moment, sit back and think about where the world
    is heading. \r\n\r\nHaven't you heard about the involvement of CIA in toppling
    ELECTED and POPULAR governments of the world? Haven't you heard how eventually
    CIA was able to murder Che Guivara (a popular latin American leader)? Haven't
    you seen how USA has been skillfully removing all her possible opponents out of
    her way towards the total global control. First it was Communism, Vietnam, Indonesia,
    Cuba, Suez Canal, Panama Canal, and now China and Islam.\r\n\r\nPakistani System
    NEEDS revolution. You CAN NOT have a PROPERLY functioning democracy as well as
    you have a corrupt system and political base. Any amount of reform can be undone
    by these power hungary politicians when they use this system to gain power back.\r\n\r\nAhmed
    Quraishi writes impressively. He has the pleasantly astonishing creativity, flair
    and right connection for investigative reporting. He is doing a great job at that.
    \ Not only this, he has taken stance that should have been taken by the ruling
    parties.\r\nZaid Hamid's appeal rests in his blunt expose, in his ability to revive
    the respect and patriotism which was long lost among Pakistanis.  Finally, somebody
    honest loyal and debonair, has come to reculcate and revive Allah's, Jinnah's
    and Iqbal's Pakistan"

    stop you to fulfil Ghazwa-a-Hind.  If US, India, Israel and rest of the world

  content: "Someone on our list commented that Zaid Hamid and his ilk have already
    won the battle for Pakistani hearts and minds and \"liberals\" have no future
    in Pakistan because \"Islam is already victorious\". I wrote a quick reply:\r\nI
    think we have to clarify our terms here:\r\n1. I dont care too much about what
    title people want to give to their ideology, its the actual mechanics and results
    that count. If people in Pakistan manage to create an Islam that has all the instruments
    of a modern state, most of the forms and protections of secular democracy, general
    acceptance of our entire heritage (not just its arab or imaginary part) and acceptance
    of modern norms of human rights and coexistence between various religions, then
    this Islam would qualify as reasonably liberal in my book. It will be the \"traditional\"
    Muslims and the radical salafist fascists who will be screaming blue murder and
    complaining about this \"godless system\", not me. \r\n2, I think there is a large
    segment of modestly educated people in Pakistan who read enough \"pakistan studies\"
    nonsense in school to become susceptible to Zaid Hamid. But I am not totally convinced
    that they mean what they say. Why do I say that? Because in practice these people
    are reasonably sane. They send their kids to modern schools, apply for scholarships
    at the British Council, desperately hunt for green cards, buy and sell stocks
    better than I do, and make plans for moving ahead in the modern world...in short,
    their actual lives are pretty much indistinguishable from the actual lives of
    middle class people in Amritsar and Jullunder (some of whom no doubt have their
    own fantasies and delusions). This Zaid Hamid stuff is mostly hot air. An occasional
    nutcase takes it too seriously and sets fire to his underwear in the process,
    but those are exceptions. My point is, the middle class will do what middle classes
    do...not what their fantasy discussions in drawing rooms seem to imply.\r\n3.
    The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The army in Pakistan is more heavily
    indoctrinated than most groups in this matter. Yet when push comes to shove, the
    army does what Uncle Sam really really wants them to do. I admit that when it
    comes to India, some of them are still not clear about which way the international
    wind is blowing, but its a matter of time. Like it or not, they will do what their
    underpriced residential plots and credit cards tell them to do, which is to adjust
    to being part of the capitalist modern world. Which means they can rant on about
    India but they will have to rein in the jihadis...that whole paradigm is just
    not compatible with \"normal\" existence in the modern world. Once they get on
    board (and who knows, they may already be on board and will soon get Zaid Hamid
    to change his tune) we will still have ALL the problems of being a \"developing\"
    country, with deep divisions, exploitation, difficult neighbors, a kleptocratic
    upper class, etc etc, and we will still play all the games states play with each
    other in the international system, but we wont arm and train half a million jihadis
    and we wont suddenly go nuts and start a war with India or anyone else....that
    is still my prediction.\r\n4. I will continue to propagate in favor of secular
    democratic values and I think I the Islamists will move more towards me than I
    will have to move towards them...not because i am so strong but because that is
    the way history is moving....THEN we will still have the problem of how to reform
    the modern capitalist system and what comes next in human history, but this argument
    about Islamism is going to pass out of fashion...not tomorrow, but one day not
    too far in the future, and we will wonder why we got so excited about it...\r\n5.
    I could be wrong, but the alternative is a very big war with very heavy casualties..
    so i really hope I am not wrong."

  content: "Let me make this clear to those individuals who are twisted enough to
    call themselves \"Liberal\".\r\n\r\nYOU ARE NOT A MAJORITY in Pakistan. You only
    represent a minority of population. So, why should your goals and desires be SHOVED
    down the throats of Majority.\r\n\r\nI dislike when liberals (superficial muslims)
    sing accolade of the western system and not see the END RESULT. This secular modern
    society has given you 2 World wars and plenty of regional conflicts, like Vietnam
    war, Arab/Israel War, Iraq War, Afghanistan War, Russian invasion of Afghanistan.
    This is all in addition to all the poverty that the world is thrown in. The evils
    of corporations is not unknown. The amount of toxic waste that these greedy corporations
    throw into our seas is well known.\r\n\r\nSecond of all why are we so SLAVE to
    western culture that we ARE unable to think we can get a better society?\r\n\r\nThis
    world and the whole universe around it is created by Allah(swt). When HE says
    something is bad, it IS bad. \r\n\r\nHE chose Islam for us and that WILL be the
    system we will follow in Pakistan whether you LIKE it or NOT.\r\n\r\nThose who
    think Islam is just a fad need to wake up to this reality. Those who are TRIVIALISING
    Islam need to grow out of their bias and ignorance.  This is the same Islam under
    whose patronage we had great civilazations like Basra, Al-Andulucia etc where
    science and learning were the core values of the society. Most of the modern inventions
    have their PRECURSOR  in the Arab sciences. ISLAM IS NOT AGAINST PROGRESS. Islam
    IS against false values, customs, inventions etc that ONLY serve to hurt human
    beings. The ILL effects of TV are known widely in the West. They write about it
    extensively. The western banking system serves ONLY the few rich families who
    LITERALLY control the world. This system is based on false principles i.e. interest
    based economy. This interest is the MOST exploitative system created by the friends
    of Satan. Why should I pay you $5000 when I ONLY borrowed $2000 in times of need?
    Should n't your conscience allow you to help me in my times of need instead of
    taking that as a  business opportunity? Those who are unable to see exploitation
    in this are Losers. \r\n\r\nThere is ENOUGH wealth, water and natural resources
    that can be used by a country and exported for FREE to the world. Every season
    million dollar worth of excess vegetation is thrown away instead of exporting
    to Africa. There is a lot of wastage of food and money and natural resources.\r\n\r\nDemocracy
    is an EVIL system. Here people are counted not evaluated resulting in the low
    quality of governership. All you have to do is campaign for most signatures and
    promulgate IMPERFECT laws that are created by IMPERFECT minds most of the time
    biased. Today we all know the ill effects of smoking but the HUGE tobacco industry
    uses her clout to EFFECTIVELY stop manufacture of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nI swear to
    God what ever 'comforts' invented in this western system have turned out to be
    REALLY poisonous to the society at large. In Islam, the scientist will not have
    an ego-trip with God. They would rather, build and invent things for the betterment
    of humanity (you can google about how there are environmentally free scientific
    solutions to, for example, treat surgar with virtually no side effects but FDA
    DOES not approve it in USA. Why? Because Pharmaceutical Industry won't make money
    if everyone is healthy)\r\n\r\nI REJECT the western system of lies, deceipts,
    cruelty, selfishness, corporatization, Machiavelian politics and indulgence in
    basic animalistic instinct instead of inducing humans to stimulate their higher
    faculties.\r\n\r\nI VOTE and Support Islamic system of Fairness, Justice, Peace,
    Altruism, Nature-friendliness, Equality, Egalitarianess."

    fact. Even according to the rules of democracy, Majority wins. And Pakistan's
    majority does not rest in her liberal or western-educated rich population which
    is wrongly termed as \"elite\" (elite because they agree with the West and are
    eager to sell their souls into slavery).\r\n\r\nMajority of Pakistan in undeveloped.
    Only 5 major cities of Pakistan which represent a small percentage (may be 5-10%)
    of total real estate of Pakistan. On top of that these \"liberals\" or \"elites\"
    are even WAY smaller in population in these cities. In Karachi,e.g,  they seem
    to be living in Defence, Clifton (mostly) and some small pockets throughout the
    city. Similarly they are found in posh localities of Islamabad or Lahore etc.
    The rest of the population is VERY indigenous and still hold on to old subcontinental
    culture where Islam is at the core.  If you count the Waderas, Nawabs or Sardars,
    they also constitute ONLY a minority.  \r\n\r\nSo, I don't understand why the
    aspirations of the minorities should rule the roost. I wish Pakistani majority
    can wake up to this fact and ASSERT themselves."

    imaginary \"perfect\" system, get used to it.\r\nJust repeating things a few hundred
    times does not make them true. \"muslim civilization\" of Baghdad and Andalusia
    was an advanced civilization of its time (though in my opinion, still underdeveloped
    compared to the earlier Roman empire). There was nothing magical about it. Many
    advances in science and technology were made, building on earlier knowledge accumulated
    by pre-muslim cultures. And many of these were then built upon in Europe and taken
    further and further.  The scientific advancements of the Arabs owed a lot to earlier
    Greco-Roman and Indian advances, but very little to peninsular Arab ideas (the
    specific forms of Islamic theology and ideology developed in that time seem to
    have a very tangential connection to specific scientific and technical advances....a
    multinational empire provided many talented people with the chance to acquire
    old knowledge and create new knowledge..thats good, but hardly in the realm of
    fairy tales where you seem to be putting it). \r\nAnyway, other than the few thousand
    nuts trained by our glorious army  and now being hunted by that same army, no
    one takes these fairy tales seriously enough to make much of an impact in this
    world. Its entertainment and propaganda and clever people use it in their politics
    just like clever people in India use \"hindutva\" and clever people in America
    like to preach \"truth, justice and the American way\". Enjoy it and be happy."

  content: "Pakistan's problem started the day she was created. The founding fathers
    never had any ideas what Pakistan was for, except demanding separate state on
    the basis of religion.  Its founding fathers saw India as a source of all problems
    facing muslims and thought that all problems will be solved just having a separate
    state, never saw all responsibilities and that will come with it.  This thinking
    is still reflected in every Pakistanis psyche as Pakistanis blame everybody for
    all their problems. \r\n\r\nPakistanis are in denial, about their cultural history
    and have inferiority complex. Pakistanis  have identity crisis as they are muslims
    but culturally nothing common with Arabs (foreign invaders who converted them
    in to Islam ) and don't think that Pakistanis have anyhting do with them. It is
    funny how Pakistanis are proud of these invaders who killed their forefathers
    and force them into Islam, boast that Pakistanis ruled India for 1000 years, even
    if that is not enough, even claim to rule Spain and Europe.  I have Arab friends
    who laugh listening to this.  Even funnier when Pakistanis talk about Arabic scientists
    as they were Pakistanis. \r\n\r\nWhy Pakistan as a country, has not decided yet
    what, how and why, it was created.? Why there is still debate after 60 years for
    its existance and creation? The reason for this question is that Pakistanis were
    promised an unrealistic haven on false pretences.  Pakistanis are still living
    in the past and waiting a miracle to happen, to become Pakistan a paradise without
    hard work or taking responsibilities. Pakistanis have developed tendencies to
    blame another countires (India, USA etc) for their laziness or inaction.  Allah,
    Sharia or reciting verses from Koran will not solve Pakistan's problem, Pakistanis
    should work hard to make their lives better."

    ideology will lead Pakistan into chaos, poverty and destruction. The society prosrpers
    having harmony, peace and stability, not from war? The shouting and threats are
    sign of frustration and weekness, not bravery. Zaid Hamid can shout, threaten,
    throw missile on any country in theory it will harm nobody, shouting costs nothing,
    if he wants to see what will happen to Pakistan as a result of his actions then
    Zaid Hamid should put into practice what he preaches. I can assure you Pakistan
    will be wiped out from the earth.\r\n\r\nWhy Arabs are not stuck in the past and
    progressing because they are confident and have no identity crisis when Pakistanis
    have neither? Europeans have realised that working togther will make people prosperous
    and living standard better. Europeans who fought wars, were arch enemies 50 years
    ago, have forgotten for the benefit of people.  People like Zaid Hamid are responsible
    for their people's misery and problems. I don't understand, how he will make Pakistan
    prosperous, going war with US, Israel and India? What Pakistanis people will gain
    from war? Does Pakistan have resources to win the war, money and weapons? Why
    Pakistan could not stand on their feet in 60 years and can't survive without foreign
    aid? Pakistanis lives in fools paradise, thinking they are the savior and leader
    of the Islamic world when they can't feed their own people and Arabs don't give
    a damn what Pakistanis think. How Pakistanis will progress when Pakistan is stuck
    in the past and lives on borrowed middle ages glory when Arabs have moved long
    way ahead."

    answer to your baseless assertion is this.  Pakistan's fault was his Islamic heritage.
    Britain had just finished off Khilafat after years of hardwork. They were not
    gonna let that hardwork go down the drain by allowing a country created in the
    name of Islam. So, they supported Hindu India. Hindus NEVER accepted Pakistan
    because they were dreaming of creating their own IMAGINARY and MYTHICAL state
    which spans from middleast to Indonesian (yeah right?)\r\n\r\nIndia has not left
    any bones untunred in breaking Pakistan up. Then through American or British machinations
    the power got to the hands of the feudal class. and they fucked everything up
    for Pakistan. They have been responsible for the backwardness of tis country.\r\n\r\nPaksitan's
    creation was justified. At the very least, we have a homeland to go home to. Just
    ask the importance of such a homeland from the Jewish diaspora."

    Pakistan or its equal to in India. These people are dreamers, neither Akhand Bharat
    or Radio Pakistan Delhi is not going to happen, you know it, I know it and they
    know it. When India or Pakistan can't provide better living standard to those
    people which they have already, how they can manage Radio Pakistan Delhi or Akhand
    Bharat etc. You know better what is happening in Pakistan or how better managed
    and ruled pakistan is.  \r\n\r\nEuropeans are not responsible for corruption,
    poverty in India or in Pakistan, it is our politicians or people who support them.
    \ If Pakistan considers that it has right to interfere in Afghanistan then no
    need to point fingers on others, every country would like to safe guard its interests.
    British supported Hindus? British supported everybody who served their interets,
    they divide muslims and hindus to rule over India. Americans and Eurpeans suported
    India after Independence?  Check the history, Pakistan was part of American game
    plan against USSR, not India but Pakistan was member of American military alliances
    CENTO, CEATO and was rewarded with money.  Nothing is free, if you want money,
    you have to give back something.  There was no land reform in Pakistan, are Europeans
    responsible for that?  \r\n\r\nIndia worked hard to break Pakistan? Well, Pakistan
    started it in 1948 in Kashmir, every country has right to fight back and Pakistan
    does too. I am not disputing creation of Pakistan, now you have Pakistan, why
    don't you work hard to make Pakistan a developed and progressive country.  Does
    India claim any Pakistani territory? If Pakistanis are thinking that it is their
    right to claim Indian territory based on religion then they are mistaken it is
    not going to happen. There are more muslims in India and majority of them are
    happy and participating in the development of India. India is not without problems
    neither is any other country. \r\n\r\nEuropeans are coming together for the betterment
    of their people, forgetting their past differences and here we are  slaves of
    the past events? Still living in fool's paradise on borrowed glory of the past,
    like drug addicts. We know and have seen that war is not solution to the problem
    so why don't we start thinking about making our people's lives better. Hard work
    and economic progress is the solution but not stone age thinking."

    just 2 years bombarding on media with his talks . Well for naive he is of some
    interest otherwise he merely recites all the conspiracy theories from youtube
    or other such sources. No orginal work buddy! \r\n\r\nAfter his alleged companionship
    with Mardood Yousuf Kazaab and him being his Khalifa, I have never seen anywhere
    where he denied that fact or denying that he think Yousuf kazaab was a false mardood.
    He he tries to divert the discussion completely  to different topic avoiding the
    original question. Now I am not satisfied with \"ckini chupri\" talks. I want
    to hear straight yes or no. He never mentions or brings the name of Yousuf Kazaab.
    \r\n\r\nRecently in an university in Lahore a student asked him very clear question
    weather he denies this or not. His reply was bla bla bla I have been in Afghanistan,
    bla bla bla Buzurgaan ne deen bala bla bla, sufiism bala bla bla bla bla bla.
    If you are not satisfied you come to me and I will make you satisfied. (a well
    documented tactic of Yousuf Kazaab to convince wealthy victims and naive young
    school/college girls to convince them in private.)  \r\n\r\nSorry Mr. Zaid Zaman

  content: The fallacy involved here is that since the US in in debt and Pakistan
    is in debt, therefore Pakistan and the US are in the same boat. The US has its
    problems, but only someone educated in an elite university could imagine that
    its problems are worse than Pakistan's or India's problems. It is true that the
    US may have to scale back its war mongering because it doesnt have the money anymore
    (though the opposite is also possible), but it is even truer that Pakistan and
    India have wasted 60 years playing "strategic games" that were much farther out
    of their reach than imperial warmongering is out of the reach of the United States.
    It is also true that in this game, Pakistan has been more on the offensive than
    India...that is not a moral judgment, its a statement of fact and it is again
    not due to some moral superiority in India but simply due to the fact that it
    has been Pakistani policy to try and change the status quo ("get kashmir", currently
    mostly in Indian hands) while it has generally been Indian policy to resist that
    change. It is also true that the army in Pakistan has acquired more power than
    the army in India and that has led to military short-sightedness determining policy
    to a greater extent than it does in India. But if you went to an elite university
    (sorry, but this is my favorite line these days, feel free to make fun of it)
    then you tend to look at things as moral issues and you have access to so many
    facts, you can always sound like the facts support your argument...anyway, I agree
    with Yahoodi, the US and even Europe will come out of this economic crisis more
    or less intact. Instead of waiting for them to fall on their face, maybe we should
    figure out how to advance the positive trends in South Asia...and they are there,
    the positive trends. In fact, I think contrary to what is taught in elite univesities
    (just kidding), Pakistan and India are both going to develop into midlevel economies
    with much improved food and shelter for most citizens within the next generation.

    friend where does in my response I deny anything about Pakistan or even mention
    it. I appreciate your worthy advice based on your assumptions.  Personally I  would
    be rather be your fan than Zaid Hamid's if I had to chose. But I see that a perfectly
    rational person that you may be, when it comes to Pakistan,Pakistani etc only
    words you can recall are, beggars, stuck in past,violent,irrational, inefriority
    complex etc tetc, and unfortunately  there is little effort on your part to make
    a difference between Policies of  successive Pakistani govts9mostly unrepresentative),
    State of Pakistan and people of Pakistan. You paint 160 million men,women and
    childrens as some deranged  entity and that is where it is hard to believe that
    your advice is an advice from a sincere and concerned fella.\r\n\r\n<i>Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t

    , Irish or for that matter Spainiards and Portugees next in line forNational bankruptcy
    and  asking for bail outs , could not see, detect or stop this financial wreckage
    becomming their fate despite being better educated, healthier and having democratic
    system of govt. Might it occur to intelligent peoples that the current Economical
    /Financial order is stacked against  some nations more heavily than others and
    keeps them in a vicious cycle of  poverty,violence and Ignorance.  The situition
    becomes so bleak that  people like Hamid or Palin can stoke peoples emotions  and
    fears rather than much needed use of rational faculties to dig out of these holes.\r\nI
    would recommend you read  'Super Imperialism, The Economic Strategy of American
    Empire' By Michael Hudson. \r\nIt does not mean that we people of Asian or subcontinental
    origin can absolve ourselves from responsibilities of a reasonable and decent
    condut. Investment in human resources in countries like Pakistan  is the need
    of hour but it is not going to happen while mutitude of conflicts divide and subdivide
    people along various fault lines. SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK IT WHAT ARE THE FACTORS/FORCES
    THAT AGGRAVATE  /FLAME these conflicts and WHAT IS THE ANTIDOTE, that is where
    friends could help us understand our faults albiet in a better language."

    more diverse than Pakistan, so Is  'Malaysian Islam' different than subcontinental
    or Iranian Islam? Now if we suppose history did not start in 1947, then how do
    you explain millions of people of Indian subcontinent origin embracing Islam voluntarily?
    Lats time I checked close to half billion people combined together in Pakistan
    ,India and Bangladesh profess Islam as their faith, Were/Are these irrational
    people ,who were waiting for a 'religion that cannot tolerate diversity' and adopted
    it as soon as they got a chance?\r\n\r\n<i>Romans, Ottoman and British empire
    did it, Pakistan is doing where it can (Afghanistan), why complan if US or West
    is doing, China has started to project its power, why complain.</i>\r\n\r\nSo
    you are saying \r\n'might is right' is fine as long as one is the mightiest.\r\n\r\n<i>If
    we have tribal or pond mentality and fight on small and petty interests, can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    see bigger picture, why blame others?</i>\r\nI was merely pointing to the bigger
    picture by bringing the factors that are beyond any Pakistani's control in discussion,
    did not mean to blame anybody, neither wanted to grant myself or any Pakistani
    a pass on our own responsibilities, that is the primary factor needed to correct
    our situition.\r\n\r\n<i>We are stuck in past, we are glorifying invaders and
    foreginers like Bin-Kasims, Ghauris, Moguls etc.</i>\r\nYou can find it on this
    blog also and through internet etc that Pakistani youth is having none of this.
    It may still be in some text books but people are much more smarter than that.\r\n\r\n<i>Let
    us work for peace, stability and constructively for the benefit of our people</i>\r\nAmen"

    play devil&acirc;&euro;&trade;s advocate and say that this phenomenon is very
    interesting, but not that important in &ldquo;real life&acirc;&euro;\x9D.
    It seems bigger than it is because the people lining up to cheer &ldquo;Sir
    Zaid&acirc;&euro;\x9D are OUR class, especially in Punjab. But I think his 15
    minutes are almost up and he will soon be replaced by some other figure.\r\nHardcore
    jihadi ideology existed before Allama Iqbal and Zaid Hamid (yes, you heard me
    right; I did put this ass and the great poet in the same sentence) and will pretty
    much exist after the ISI decides to dump &ldquo;Sir Zaid&acirc;&euro;\x9D.
    For those people who are exploding in markets and mosques the anjuman e himayat
    e Islam verses of Allama Lahori and the rants of Zaid sahib are really just the
    icing on the cake, not a cause of the problem. Then you have the mummy-daddy jihadis
    who flock to lectures by Zaid Hamid. Well, I am sorry, but I am not too impressed
    with this lot. They are not capable of exploding or even doing something moderately
    dangerous like harboring a terrorist. They are just filling in time between dates
    at &ldquo;Tea-coffee and me&acirc;&euro;\x9D and A-level superexams
    (in which they do almost as well as the Indians). Allama and this Zaid Hamid nonsense
    is just entertainment and emotional release. Sure, some will go nuts like that
    fraud Qudratullah Shahab and invent stories of spying in Israel without sleeping
    for ten days (he actually believed that&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;reminds me of &ldquo;a
    beautiful mind&acirc;&euro;\x9D, but without the beautiful mind). They will get
    some degraded version of western education, do tech level jobs or get rich fleecing
    medicare (OK, I am kidding, they will do all kinds of solid real work and bring
    up their families and pay their mortgages, good solid middle class lives await
    most of them)&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;they are not a serious threat.\r\nI am NOT claiming
    that everyone in Pakistan is on the verge of some kind of middle class utopia.
    I am just saying the &ldquo;sir zaid and sir azmat&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    crowd is a small middle class phenomenon with NO resonance in the larger mass
    of Pakistanis. And I am happy to lay a bet on this with anyone who thinks Sir
    Zaid will become some kind of serious player in Pakistani politics. Even Imran
    Khan (whose ideology is a more sensible version of Sir Zaid&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    ranting) has more real support than this joker. And I am one of those who think
    HE (the great Imran, who I really do think is a &ldquo;great hero&acirc;&euro;\x9D)
    has no serious future in Pakistani politics either."

  content: "Below is the Email communication which is I think helpful for you people
    to understand the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssalamoalikum, \r\n\r\nThere are few
    things which i would like to bring into your notice here. He is smart what he
    said in his you tube about aqaid the same almost he wrote on a paper format Iqrar
    Nama i read that too.\r\n\r\nNow try to understand it here the case with cool
    mind. He seems not culprit by himself when we all heard about his ideology. The
    problem is he is linked with Yousuf kazzab and he is his Kalifa and Sahabi. (Audio
    Is also there of the speech. It was proven by the court and by the people who
    knows him in the court.)\r\n\r\nHe did not said anything wrong about Yosuf kazzab
    in his Youtube as well as his written matter which he recently released as his
    iqrar nama. Although it is launch day before yesterday or yesterday.\r\n\r\nNow
    try to understand it in different way, If you know him by any means Ghulam ahmed
    Qadiani or not but you will say him kafir &amp; Murtid after knowing his aqaids.
    right. You will not say only, That i believe on Allah and Rasool SAW and i am
    not concern with Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani. No .... You have to say Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani
    is Kafir and murtid.\r\nYour eman and deeni ghairat will not let you quiet on
    Jhotay nabi Marzai par.\r\nIt is part of Emaniat.\r\n\r\nNow, here he did not
    say anything about Yousuf Kazzab still, It is required indeed. We have no argument
    if his personality become clear again as he was in my good book earlier when i
    dont know about him even every Pakistani was thinking like this.\r\n\r\nSecond
    thing for an example, If you know a little bit about Qadiani then you will know
    their Tareeqa Wardaat.\r\nYou will be surprise, Even now they are saying we believe
    on Nabi SAW, Some will say he is the last prophet even(Only few). Why.... they
    beleif Ghulam Ahmed is same as Mohammed, (zilli or browsi taur par) Naozobillah
    or he is Mehdi or sometimes he is Maseeh Maood. See even now.\r\nHow do you know
    about them? by their books what his False and liar prophet said in his book about
    his aqaid. Now even they reject we know all their aqaid by the books. They have
    to condemn Ghulam AHmed Qadiani in any case which they do not, so even now if
    they says they beleif on Nabi SAW they are still Ahmedi/Qadiani and non Muslims.
    right.\r\n\r\nWhy, This Zaid Hamid did not say anything against him still, he
    is only doing lafzon ka hair phair. If he clear his views as per the shariah then
    he is my brother and also a role model to listen and follow his ideology.\r\n\r\nIn
    the above attachments that you sent to me of Zaid Hamid. In which he said it is
    a ilmi Discussion was going on with Majlis tahafuz-e- Khatme nabuwat. Just listen
    the You tube links you sent me in the other email. are those wording which he
    used for Ulemas, Debandis and islamic scholars are ilmi guftugo. Sad afsos hai.
    Please listen again he said they are jhotay kazaab, 2 takky k molvi fisad barpa
    karani walay, firoan. is this ilmi guftogu.\r\nZaid hamid is the biggest liar
    and a big fitna.\r\n\r\nSee the answer of your attachments.\r\nhttp://zaidhamidexposition.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\nPlease
    come out from his dajal. After listening you will understand how big liar he is.
    He is a fraudia and using media to fool people but more important for me is you
    before others.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read the following Article and think logically
    and I pray to Allah to guide all muslims on correct path.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/28168015/Pori-Pakistani-Baradari-Jhooti-Ya-Akela-Zaid-Zaman-Khatam-e-Nabuwat\r\n\r\nPlease
    see another proof against him. he is the suspect.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/28202289/AMTKN-Open-Challenge-to-Zaid-Hamid
    \r\n\r\nI also put some comment on your second email but those comments i wrote
    before this email so if you want to read those no problem but after this email
    , i hope and prayed all things will be cleared in your mind.\r\n\r\nAllah ham
    sub ko hidayat naseeb farmaiy aur hidayat par rakhay. ameen.\r\n\r\nWarmest Regards\r\nAzeem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
    \ Other side response of my trailing email\r\nThere are 3 attachments in this
    email of the person, one which is the letter of Dr. Israr Ahmed on 9/03/2010,
    \r\nI already put the link in the end of the post which will answer the first
    attachment.\r\n\r\n2nd &amp; 3rd attachment related to that he is not link by
    any means of Maulana Shahadat. You can see his entire document on the internets.
    I have answered this in my leading email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssalam U Alaikum,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
    glad to hear that you remembered all those emails I sent regarding Zaid Hamid
    on Pakistan, USA, CIA &amp; Khilafat. He was linked with Yousuf Kazaab for a fact.
    But hidayat from ALLAH subhanawa Tallah can change anyone at anytime in life.
    So, the question that I have and many others would like to ask is about his faith
    &amp; belief. \r\nIs he in fact pushing the torch of Yousuf Kazzab forward???
    or is he trying to do something else?? What are his motives??\r\n \r\nAttached
    above are the articles regarding this matter.\r\nA good advice is good for all
    in general and we are advised by our prophet S.A.W.W to listen and analyze. His
    vision about pakistan, return of khilafa, interest free economy are clear and
    we appreciate them. His informative lectures on Zionist &amp; Zionism, Jews, CIA
    conspiracy &amp; many other hard hitting &amp; EYE opening topics are MUST WATCH
    for muslims from ANY maslak.\r\n \r\nThat all said, Muslim scholars from ashraful
    madaris believe that Zaid Hamid, Zakir Naik &amp; many other lecturers who are
    extremely influential are on their watch list.\r\nSo, it is advisable not to trust
    everything they say &amp; to consult from QURAN &amp; SUNNAT before following
    them. \r\n \r\nLet us all be open minded enough to FIND THE TRUTH, A man is only
    accused until he is found guilty, in between that time we all should search &amp;
    examine the facts.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\n \r\nP.S. May ALLAH guide us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy
    first email, which I sent to the person earlier\r\n\r\nAssalamoalaikum,\r\n\r\nIt
    is confirmed Maulana did challange to prove Yusuf Kazzab did try for false prophethood.
    and Zaid Hamid is linked with him. Who is Maulana Saeed Ahmed Jalalpuri, He (rahmatullah
    Alai) was the Ameer of Majlis -e-Tahafuz Khatm-e-Nabuwat after Ameer Yusuf Ludhyanwi
    shaheed RA. He was also answering apke Masail or unka hal in the Friday Jang newspaper
    after the shahadat of Maulana Yousuf Ludhyani.\r\nI am here posting the link of
    the Umat Newspaper article in which, it was questioned to Zaid Hanid First.\r\nhttp://www.kashifhafeez.com/large.php?path=2008-10-06&amp;img=kh_articles/large/2008-10-06.gif\r\n\r\nAnd
    also posting the interview of Maulana Saeed Ahmed Jalalpuri,\r\n\r\nInterview
    of Maulana Saeed Ahmad Jalalpuri Sahab Regarding Yousuf Kazzab &amp; Zaid Hamid\r\nYesterday,
    I went to &ldquo;Aalmi Majlis e Tahaffuz e Khatm e Nubuwwat&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    (AMTKN) office at Purani Numaish, M.A. Jinnah Road, Masjid Babur Rehmat, Karachi
    Pakistan. And, I got an opportunity to talk to Maulana Saeed Ahmed Jalalpuri sahab
    himself, who is the Ameer of AMTKN. I am producing my conversation with respected
    Maulana below in the form of questions and answers:\r\nQ: Did some one from AMTKN
    or Ulema Karam actively participate in the case against Yusuf Kazab?\r\nA: Obviously
    ! the case was registered by Maulana Muhammad Ismail Shuja Abadi on the directions
    of quaideen of AMTKN\r\nQ: Some people say that the Yusuf Kazab became a victim
    of Daily Khabrain Editor Zia Shahid&acirc;&euro;&trade;s enmity because Zia Shahid
    had some land/money dispute with Yusuf Kazab?\r\nA: Suppose, if this was the case,
    then leave Zia Shahid, and take rest of the evidences, which are too much, coming
    from too many sources, too strong and too crystal clear in nature. AMTKN challenges
    any one who have any &ldquo;proof&acirc;&euro;\x9D that Yusuf Kazab
    did not claimed to be a prophet, please come forward and AMTKN will listen him/her
    carefully, analyze those proofs and will clarify its stance publicly with all
    those proofs and counter-proofs. Its an open challenge for any one.\r\nQ: Maulana,
    how AMTKN proof that Zaid Hamid was indeed &ldquo;Syed Zaid Zaman&acirc;&euro;\x9D,
    the Khalifa of Yusuf Kazab?\r\nA: I recommend you to read my booklet which contain
    non refutable proof that &ldquo;Syed Zaid Zaman&acirc;&euro;\x9D,
    the Khalifa of Yusuf Kazab is none other than Zaid Hamid. AMTKN stand by this
    document and if Zaid Hamid wants to refute it or prove us wrong than he is more
    than welcome to visit us any time he like. We would sit together and discuss all
    counter proofs that he have and inshaAllah there will be khair. Nothing to fight
    over, its very simple, we have proofs you have counter-proofs, lets sit together
    and resolve it once and for all.\r\nQ: Maulana do you have all those proofs in
    the documentation form?\r\nA: Not only do we have those proofs in the documentation
    form, but those people who were affected by the murtid Yusuf Kazab are in our
    loop. I have personally met with some of those people as well.\r\nQ: Person A
    was a follower of Yusuf Kazab, but now he says that he has &ldquo;nothing
    to do with Yusuf or his beliefs or any other people like him&acirc;&euro;\x9D.
    What is the minimum requirement according to Shariah for Person A to come out

    A will have to do the following:\r\n1. Acceptance &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Accept
    publicly and openly that he &ldquo;did&acirc;&euro;\x9D a mistake
    by negating the finality of Prophet Muhammad Salalaho Alayhi Wassalam and by following

    are not enough and does not fulfill the requirements of Shariah (as mentioned
    in the answer of above question).\r\nQ: Maulana, will AMTKN welcome Zaid Hamid
    if he wishes to visit you to discuss this issue in detail?\r\nA: I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve
    already stated it in clear terms, we will welcome Zaid Hamid to come and discuss
    this issue. But, I can also tell you one thing, if Zaid Hamid is a culprit and
    is double crossing then, mark my words, he will never come, he will prefer to
    drink poison than visiting us at AMTKN office.\r\n\r\nRegarda\r\nAzeem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    is the addition I did later as I saw this recently posted and it will also exposed
    false propaganda of Zaid Hamid.\r\n\r\nSee the truth of Dr. Israr Ahmed relation.

  content: "Found in article in Wkpd. Just the thought of it being possible shows
    how far Indian hawks can go to destroy Pakistan.\r\n\r\n\"Over last few years,
    R&amp;AW is covertly executing an offensive second phase operation, Chanakya II,
    which employs a \"win trust in disguise, divide and conquer\" strategy. While
    R&amp;AW continues to expand its spy network outreach deeper into Afghanistan
    and Pakistan, paradoxically, this strategy also includes sponsorship of groups
    that professedly preach a vehemently anti-India, pro-Pakistan, nationalistic ideology
    to the Pakistani masses. R&amp;AW covertly nurtures media personalities, think-tanks
    and defense analysis consulting groups in Pakistan who attempt to squarely influence
    Pakistani popular thinking stoking the anti-establishment sentiment and a foreign
    invasion paranoia. R&amp;AW assumes that this strategy would raise a new leadership
    in Pakistan that would first win the trust of the masses, then infiltrate into
    the corridors of Pakistani political power, and finally work in disguise towards
    the consolidation of Indian influence on the entire Indus riparian.\""

    makes sacrifices to protect country but Pakistani army is sacrificing country
    to prtect itself. It was not India, why Pakistan lost Bangladesh, it was due to
    Pakistani army. Pakistani army will do everything to keep power and to undermine

    If Pakistan disintegrate, the army and ISI will be responsible again, as it was

    of this particular narrative. Not in a superficial \"analyst\" manner, but really
    dig up sources and references and see where the trail starts and where it leads.
    Zaida has not invented this idiocy by himself. He had help. Look into Qudratullah
    Shahab, Ashfaq Ahmed and Mumtaz Mufti, then into the peers and \"thinkers\" THEY
    were following. Its an interesting story. Of course, Zaida takes it to new heights
    of idiocy. But there is a long story behind it.\r\nAbout the India bashing, I
    think it seems peripheral in the sense that the narrative is really about how
    the creation of Pakistan is the first step in the revival of a new Islamic empire
    (madina e saani), but at an emotional level, that is the heart of the matter.
    After all, these are Indians who hate nothing as much as they hate the idea of
    India. Psychohistorians will generate many papers and grants writing about this
    after the whole thing dies (hopefully with a whimper, but there is a non-zero
    probability of ending with a real bang accompanied by mushroom clouds).\r\nAt
    the level of his followers, this is a very very brittle ideology. I have seen
    people explode in anger, then break out in tears and then become a committed Zaid-hater
    in the space of a few hours. The whole things is a psychiatrists dream....."

    behind  Pakistan's creation.  Pakistan's creation was based on negativity (India
    - muslims = Pakistan), it was not even muslims + mulims = Pakistan. Pakistan's
    creators didn't realise that the country will come with responsibilities to its
    citizens, they spent energy and time to prove that UP muslims can't live with
    Hindus and a separate land will solve all economical and social problems facing
    muslims. After partition, where India concentrated its efforts to unite the country,
    abolishing feudal system and land reforms etc. Pakistan's emphasis was on getting
    more Indian territory based on religion, ignoring economical and social reforms,
    settlements of displaced muslims from India. Pakistan was a disaster from first
    day, UP muslims for whom Pakistan was created and faught for it, became 3rd class
    citizens and Bengalis refuse to accept Urdu. Islam that was the founding stone
    for Pakistan's creation turned out to be the problem. Islam might work for monolithic
    muslim society and Pakistan was not.  Pakistan can't go bashing muslim Iran or
    Afghanistan (that will be accepting the defeat), it has to be secular Indian system.
    Pakistan was an artificial country without Pakistani citizens, Urdu a foreign
    language.  That is why Pakistanis are insecure, have identity crisis (pretending
    to be Arabs) and should hate everything that is Indian or have to do with India.
    \ Pakistan spent more time to stop India progressing rather solving its own problems.
    \ Pakistan has to cure it self from pathological obsession of comparing with india
    if it has to progress and develop."

  content: Yahoodi, I think you overestimate the role of ideology in national life.
    I think all intellectuals do that. In actual practical details, Pakistan is not
    as different from India as you may imagine. Somethings work,  many do not, but
    its not a black and white comparison. Roads in Pakistani Punjab may be better
    than in Indian punjab in some areas, not in others. Agriculture has developed
    more in India, but not by a huge margin and in the last 2-3 years there has been
    a surprising transformation in the fortunes of rural central punjab (I speak anecdotally,
    someone else will have to get the figures, but I can tell you that in our village
    the pendulum has swung in favor of the villagers for the first time in decades.....due
    to inflation, farm products are selling for more, city poor are in worse shape
    than rural poor). Education has improved in the cities. Services provided by the
    private sector have definitely improved. Islamic Pakistan is still doing better
    than secular Bihar or UP. I agree that at a macro level the incoherence of the
    basic national idea leads to nonsense like military rule and jingoistic India-bashing,
    and jihadi terrorism has caused a huge crisis of its own, but even WITH all that,
    the lives of most people are not as different as you may imagine. I think IF Pakistan
    had stayed on the jihadi course, then in 10 years the difference would become
    glaringly obvious, but I also think its NOT going to stay on the jihadi course.
    I think the two countries are joined at the hip and if one improves, the other
    tends to follow...we watch India too closely to be left too far behind. All this
    Zaid Hamid nonsense is really the dying embers of the jihadi dream. Its going
    going gone....I did say there is a non-zero possibilty of going with a bang, but
    its not a large probability.

  content: I agree, Pakistani Punjab and some other regions are more advanced than
    UP and Bihar. Agriculture sector is still not well developed in certain parts
    of India. Pakistan should invest more in education to counter and dilute jihadi
    influence. I also hope that Pakistan will not stay on self destructive jihadi
    course and will soon find its way out from present mess. More depends on how Pak
    army will react to the situation. Will army think more about development, progress
    and future of Pakistan? The regional political stability is crucial for the economic
    progress of south east and central asia.  Jihadi terrorism will push back region
    to dark ages and  will further add to the misery of the people's lives.

  content: "Zaid Hamid has been making many tall claims in his talks. I shall talk
    of a few:\r\n1. The myth of 1000 years of Muslim rule over India\r\nMuhammad bin
    Qasim did enter and capture Sindh in the 8th Century but that ingress was not
    a stable one and boundaries of Islamic Caliphate kept on changing. Mahmud Ghaznavi
    did not really establish any empire over what is today known as Pakistan and India.
    It was only when Muhammad Ghori captured Delhi that a Sultanat with Islamic character
    was created in the region. The year 1192 AD.\r\nIslamic rule over Delhi in some
    form or the other continued till 1857 but it kept on waxing and waning during
    this period.\r\nThe most prosperous and progressive period of Islamic rule was
    when it moved away from the rabid variety to more assimilative and accommodative
    regime, in Deccan and in the Mughal Durbar.\r\nZaid Hamid will do well to remember
    that other than Spain, where there was a violent reaction to Islamic rule and
    consequent expulsion of a reasonably benevolent and progressive regime, India
    remains the only country which did not convert to Islam in totality.\r\n2. The
    threat of another Panipat\r\nFirst Battle of Panipat was in 1526 between Ibrahim
    Lodi and Babur - both Muslims.\r\nSecond Battle in 1556 was between Mughals and
    a usurper Hemu who happened to be a Hindu but whose main forces comprised disgruntled
    Mughals.\r\nThe Third Battle in 1761 was between Ahmad Shah Durrani - an Afghan
    and the Maratha Confederacy, mainly Hindu forces, for suzerainty over the Mughal
    Kingdom - which was hardly an empire now. Marathas lost and Durrani captured Delhi,
    looted a Muslim kingdom, carried home the booty and slaves, including Muslim women
    and children.\r\nSo which Panipat are you threatening India with Mr. Hamid?\r\nWould
    you also care to remember the Qatl-e-aam in Delhi by Taimur and Nadir Shah at
    different times in History? These were both Muslims and Delhi was the Capital
    of an Islamic Empire if one is to believe your story of 100o years of Muslim rule.\r\n3.
    You speak of India as a land of Hindu Zionists.\r\nYou should remember that Zionism
    as a philosophy is more alien to Hinduism than to Islam. The growth of Islam in
    India was not such a painless process as Islamic revisionist historians would
    have us believe. Sindh does not regard Dahir as a tyrant even today or Muhammad
    bin Qasim as a benevolent invader. The cry of Allah-hu-Akbar has been used by
    the faithful not only in praise of Allah but also in perpetrating intolerable
    atrocities on the defenceless and the defeated. While the greatness of the invocation
    cannot be held in doubt, its use for not so holy purposes is also not to be doubted,
    especially when it is reduced to a battlecry as many other battlecries the world
    over.\r\n4. Khyber Solution\r\nPlease do not invoke the name of the Rasul (saw)
    of Allah in your puerile theorising.\r\nMr. Hamid grow up and become a good Muslim
    and a good Pakistani and stop this childish petulant behaviour. The world, and
    our neighbourhood, would be a better place if you desisted from warmongering.\r\nHave
    faith in Allah."

    they demand more regional autonomy. Although a constitution basically defines
    the manner in which sovereign power is shared (and exercised), the 1973 Constitution
    gives, to the Prime Minister or the President, absolute power to appoint the COAS,
    the CJ, the Secretaries, the Ambassadors and the Ministers etc and, generally,
    to post and transfer officials on Key Jobs. As a result, it breeds, instead of
    Leaders, civilian dictators, thereby creating such situations as attract periodic
    military interventions. It is, therefore, that no Constitutional amendment can,
    unless and until we readdress our sovereign code, prevent a military coups. How
    long can we circumvent the constitution and end up with amendments and failures?
    \ All proposals are time bound and need to be adopted at an appropriate time frame.\r\n\r\n\tTo
    keep the nation united I therefore propose a national government with rights of
    governance to all political parties represented in the parliament. The period
    of five years 1825 days should be divided by the 272 seats of National Assembly.
    The party securing highest number of seats should head the Government first followed
    by second highest to the lowest. Elected members of national and Provincial Assemblies
    in election 2008 should be given a right of heading one Ministry. All intellectual
    and interested members should submit proposal of reforms of each ministry they
    are interested to head.  Best from them should be first minister followed by better
    and good up to the last.  Every member must get chance of heading one ministry
    in his turn equally to all of his colleagues.  This is the only solution to make
    sure that assembly will complete its tenure.  It has become absolutely necessary
    to adopt a system which could meet the challenges faced by our nation.  Time demands
    broad based democracy based upon five basic institutions.  Education, Economics,
    Justice, Defence and Executvies.\r\n\r\nRELIGION:  Compulsion is incompatible
    with religion because religion depends upon faith and will, which would be meaningless
    if induced by force.  Therefore, we need to introduce a faith code inbuilt with
    a system for utilizing the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;mosque&acirc;&euro;&trade; as a
    citizen centre.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS: \tWe need to introduce new codes with inbuilt
    mechanism to transform feudalism into corporate farming which will provide us
    an opportunity to synchronize, on the one hand, demand with production and, on
    the other, production with consumption.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE:  We need to develop and
    introduce a preventive, instead of a punitive jury code, so that the colonial
    judicial system inherited by us can be discarded and replaced by a preventive
    system of justice.\r\n\r\nDEFENCE:  Army should be made responsible only for Geographic
    Boundaries (Air, Sea and Road) without any compromise.  But Civil Defence needs
    to be designed on citizens input.  Govt. should have only supervisory role.\r\n\r\n\tAs
    a result of such reforms, each of our codes will not only be rendered in consonance
    with our ideology, religious reservations, cultural traits, natural resources
    and economic opportunities but also compatible with our present and future needs
    in the modern world and international community.\r\n\r\n\tBeing a society architect,
    I feel disturbed to see my country in total disarray.  I am available, in the
    national cause, for any query or feedback.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for a prosperous
    Pakistan.\r\n\r\nSYED AMMAR BUKHARI\r\ncell.+923212345617\r\nwww.theradiantpath.org"

    using three tenses in their languages.  \r\n        The Quran was revealed, in
    the Arabic language, in the Past and Future tenses alone and, therefore, is not
    allowed to be recited, during prayers, in any worldly language due to this incompatibility
    of tenses. However, many scholars, while interpreting the message of the Quran,
    confuse the meanings on account of the use, in their languages, of three tenses.
    \r\n        NIMROD (Warrior against Lord) raised the Tower of Babel to compete
    with Bait-Allah (Makkah) built by IBRAHEEM and ISMAIL (Peace be upon them).  While
    the builder of KAABA is called MAEMAAR and his followers are Believers, Nimrod,
    the builder of the Tower of Babel, and his followers are called FREEMASONS  who
    have all along been trying to corrupt the believers in  revealed religion by promoting

    USA..and ally-cum-ATM of pakistan...The things that he says about India and Israel.
    He keeps on quoting history...like the Mecca Medina Khyber story (check youtube
    for this video of Mr. Zaid Hamid's message to india))...Its insulting and degrading..Does
    he think that if Pakistan attacks India..india will do nothing?? does he actually
    think that after such a conflict pakistan would be able to stand on its feet???...let
    me make one thing very clear..the only reason why the subcontinent still exists
    is because india has always exercised restraint...if instead of india, pakistan
    would have had a country like israel as its neighbor..this region would have long
    decended into total anarchy like iraq!!! \r\nHis open support for the mujahideen
    infiltrating into india is actually corrupting the mindset of ordinary pakistanis...constant
    war rhetoric by both countries is not helping..\r\nTalks are futile if not backed
    by action!!!..this inaction has led so many in india, and im sure in pakistan
    also, to question the whole concept of bilateral talks...are there ability to
    restore peace...if pakistan today gives up people like Dawood Ibrahim and Hafeez
    Muhammad Sayeed..im sure india would go out of her way to bring peace to our very
    turbulent region..i hav more i want to say on this isssue...bt i need some more
    time to recollect my thoughts!!!"

  content: Over last few years, R&amp;AW is covertly executing an offensive second
    phase operation, Chanakya II, which employs a "win trust in disguise, divide and
    conquer" strategy. While R&amp;AW continues to expand its spy network outreach
    deeper into Afghanistan and Pakistan, paradoxically, this strategy also includes
    sponsorship of groups that professedly preach a vehemently anti-India, pro-Pakistan,
    nationalistic ideology to the Pakistani masses . R&amp;AW covertly nurtures media
    personalities, think-tanks and defense analysis consulting groups in Pakistan
    who attempt to squarely influence Pakistani popular thinking stoking the anti-establishment
    sentiment and a foreign invasion paranoia. R&amp;AW assumes that this strategy
    would raise a new leadership in Pakistan that would first win the trust of the
    masses, then infiltrate into the corridors of Pakistani political power, and finally
    work in disguise towards the consolidation of Indian influence on the entire Indus
    riparian.

    I don't know that Zaid hamid is good guy or bad guy, but the missions that he is setting for nation of Pakistan are not attainable under leadership of a person who has personality of Zaid Hamid. Ultimately we can say that Zaid Hamid has no such characteristics which belongs to a leader who is looking to get all targets of Khallaft -e- Rashidda.

    So, sorry Mr. Zaid I am not going with you! You must have to change yourself a lot before you build a nation about which you see dreams in nights, If you are sincere  with nation  of Pakistan then you must perform your own renaissance otherwise your every morning will have nothing from your last night dreams.

    by a  group of irreligious corrupt generals who are firmly under American control.
    When ISI or whoever selected him for this purpose, they failed to carry out a

    a video of  'Sir' Zaid Hamid and had little difficulty perceiving his ostensible
    vitriol being fed to capricious Pakistani youth. People who rise by duping gullible
    people are common in every society, even in civilized western world. They never
    pose any danger until and unless substantial number of people start buying their
    rhetoric. That's what happening in Pakistan right now. You have already articulated
    many points which clarified my further doubts about self proclaimed security analyst
    'Sir' Zaid Hamid.\r\n\r\nFor the fans of 'Sir' Zaid Hamid I would only like to
    say : Please use your mind."

    tear apart the world with his ideologies.People like Hitler have been very sucessfull
    in past in implementing their radical philosophies with the ultimate consequence
    of destruction of their own theories and country.Even if this person becomes what
    he achieves to do so ; the result is very clear. What happened to Germany in the
    past should be a good lesson for everyone with the same ideology. A corrupt mind
    can lead a nation and the world to chaos. Peace and victory of the truth is inevitable.
    I would still say zaid go ahead and try what you want. Poiniting fingers on others
    will not help you or your country.

    of time, he was also said crazy guy, gone nuts, totally mad, but that dream came
    true... \r\n\r\nJust a year before the death of Allama Iqbal, he was asked that
    u use to say that muslim will get united and will be living in harmony in seperate
    independent state, where are these things, who is telling u all this, are you
    bullying us?, But within 7 years of time PAKISTAN came into being. \r\n                      \r\nGOD

    and he always believed in executing his plans. This guy only knows to raise his
    voice to the decibals where human ears can't stand.  The thing I pity the most
    is that absolutely no one has ever question has claims about the situation in
    the world. He has his own vision about stuff and he puts in forward in the name
    of ALLAH. I really dont understand how people can afford listening to a person
    whose conspiracy theories are nothing less than comical. I will just present one
    example of this.\r\nHe claimed that the 2008 Presidential elections in the US
    were based on a Pakistan centric agenda and the best person to carry forward the
    work left  by George Bush of destabilizing Pakistan was elected as the next US
    president. I mean WOW!! That's the only word that comes to my mind."

    for yours that your honour should expand the area of developing awareness about
    Islam and Islamic history, mean to say that why dont you come to attend gathering
    at small places i.e. small cities &amp; villages. As according to my knowledge
    revolution always caused by common people, for instance french revolution, iranian

    the history of Pakistan very few men in politics have ever been sincere to our
    nation. I personally have all my life lived in the west and having a true Islamic
    system would really reform our nation and all the things Mr. Hamid says are pretty
    correct however I don't know if he's too good to be true for Pakistan because
    as you can examine yourself history has proved otherwise.

  content: "First of all I am not a Pakistani, but I take a deep interest in the happenings
    of the country. A country formed on a basis of religion by few influential people
    deciding the fate of the many following the same religion. \r\nZaid Hamid, I wouldn't
    like to put any honorary prefix to his name, is one of those people who thinks
    'Any publicity is good publicity' like a failed celebrity who wants to have his
    share of limelight at any cost. May be he has some vested political interests
    or for any other reason I don't know but he is a person I tend to follow for an
    amusement value. After a hard exhausting day at work, when I go on a video website
    and watch his silly contradictory predictions and so called 'defense analysis'
    which makes me laugh and really think that really the Pakistani's follow this
    person...!! I would have been more scared if the analysis or predictions would
    have come from Mr. Hasan Nisar and his likes. Anyways I hope the Pakistani civilians
    understand the true nature of Zaid Hamid and evolve into more informed and aware
    people. To sum it all, I would like to share a quote;\r\nEvery miserable fool
    who has nothing at all of which he can be proud, adopts as a last resource pride
    in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and happy to defend all its faults
    and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own\r\ninferiority.&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n&acirc;&euro;&bull;

<p>So, I turn to you, my collective hive brain. Who is this "Dr." "Prof." Zaid Hamid? He has, from most accounts, secured a niche similar to Glenn Beck in Pakistani media - combining ultra-nationalism with a taste for finding Zionist or Hindu involvement in the Pakistani sphere. Here he explains, for example, what truths lie behind "conspiracy theories":</p>
<p><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/obboA3-8m88&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/obboA3-8m88&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0xe1600f&color2=0xfebd01&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="405"></embed></object></p>
<p>"We are against the Zionist politics of the Brahmanical elite". Alrighty then. Some other hair-raising stuff <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkvM1H90IXI">here</a> with Ali Azmat.</p>
<p>He is also, through his privately produced program <em>Brass Tacks</em>, engaged in producing historical narratives - from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ospz8ityN3E">Khalid b. Walid</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YA_TfvqFUk">1857</a> - the "War of Independence". ("More Indians were killed by the British between 1757 and 1857 than at any time in the previous 5000 years"). Naturally, this makes me very, very interested in him, professionally speaking.</p>
<p>The cursory searches on the internets reveal all kind of contestations - he is an agent of ISPR, he is a true Muslim, he is a former acolyte of a claimant to the Prophethood, he is a true Muslim, etc. What I am really interested in, is figuring out his audiences, his appeals to them, and his theories of media (and mediation). His wiki page is no more than a stub. Can we fill this profile up? Can we place him on a scale of Glenn Beck to Yusuf al-Qaradawi?</p>
