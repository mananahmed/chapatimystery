  content: "I found your blog courtesy of Bookslut and I'm looking forward to digging
    into your archives!\r\n\r\nI hope we'll see a review of the \"Serious Men\" by
    Manu Joseph. I saw it in the NYT but I don't trust their reviews... which is why
    I read Bookslut! :)"

  content: Hey, cool idea! Will the book reviews stick to modern literature, or go
    back to medievel and olden times?

  content: Serious Men...interesting idea, looking into it. Nikolai, I wasn't planning
    to limit the period, but keeping it to stuff that's in print and potentially of
    interest to non-specialist types.

<p>I have a new column at Bookslut. The title of my column comes to you courtesy of Sepoy. Here's the <a href="http://bit.ly/adZC9f">link</a>. The column is meant to introduce readers to South Asian literature beyond the Barnes and Noble display tables. The first installment is a review of <em>India: A Traveler's Literary Companion</em>, edited by Chandrahas Choudhury. Suggestions for titles to review from you, gentle readers, are always welcome.</p>
