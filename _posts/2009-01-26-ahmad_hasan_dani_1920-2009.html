  content: "[...] Belatedly, I have learned that the one of the most significant historian
    of Sindh, and one of the most meticulous historian in Pakistan, Nabi Bux Khan
    Baloch passed away on April 6, 2011. Almost every thing I have touched, directly
    related to my dissertation, was created, edited, compiled or reflected upon by
    Dr. Baloch. I have been arguing with him, through him, for this past decade. To
    my regret, I never got a chance to meet him. But as someone who is infinitely
    familiar with his vast Sindhi/early Islam bibliography, I can pay no greater tribute
    to a scholar than that he was exacting, precise and thorough in his handling of
    an archive that defies almost everyone. He was, quite possibly, the last of the
    greats in Pakistan&#8217;s historical field. We have already lost K K Aziz and
    Ahmad Hasan Dani. [...]"

<p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&sa=G&oi=qs&q=ahmad+hasan+dani+author:a-dani">Ahmad Hasan Dani</a>, the leading archeologist and historian of Indus Valley as well as other ancient sites has passed away. A <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C01%5C27%5Cstory_27-1-2009_pg11_9">notice</a> of his life and career. Also, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/danitext.html">an interview</a> with Omar Khan from 1998. A great loss. </p>
