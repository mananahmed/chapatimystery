  content: Superb.  Man I've spent a lot of time getting frustrated trying to find
    Urdu books in Bhopal ("only religious books; go to Delhi; they read literature
    there").  This is clearly akin to Freud's account of "displacement" and deferral
    as essential to the process of dreaming...

  content: "<i>Not only that, I discovered that the majority of Urdu historical or
    literary critical work was available &ldquo;only in imports&rdquo;
    since &ldquo;No one in Pakistan does Urdu, bhai. It is all over there.
    Kids here don't even read the newspaper in Urdu.&rdquo;</i>   This
    is depressing considering the the state of Urdu in India is pretty bad. Hindi
    isn't much better, everybody is crazy for English these days; we need more stuff
    in translation that goes both ways. Linguistic apartheid really will be the bane
    of our society. Some of the best things I have seen written on Godhra, terrorism
    and caste have been in Hindi."

  content: "Some of that \"no one in pakistan does Urdu\" is an exaggeration -- not
    to downplay the seriousness of it, but just that \"Oh, Urdu is lost\" is itself
    a hallowed trope of Urdu-speakers :-)  And, there is no doubt that it is
    easier to find Indian writers in Urdu, in Pakistan than in India -- for instance,
    the likes of Qurratulain Hyder's novels are way more likely to have been published
    in Pakistan than India.  The reason is that with the increasing confinement of
    Urdu to madrassas post-1947, Urdu has become not just a language culturally associated
    with Muslims, but a religious symbol.  Thus, most of those who DO read Urdu in
    India tend to read only religious texts, duas, etc. in it (and use Hindi or another
    language for daily life); those in the social classes most likely to patronize
    the arts tend to read in English.  [The newspaper is perhaps the Urdu-mode that
    transcends social barriers, but perhaps only in Hyderabad will \"English Medium\"-types
    be reading Siasat.  Interestingly, I do find that the highest quality Indian Urdu
    newspapers -- Inquilab, Siasat, and the Rashtriya Sahara -- offer better quality
    than their Pakistani Urdu counterparts, at least if my assumption that Jang is
    the most prominent one is on the money.]  In recent years, there are some
    very very slight hopeful signs, that might yet lead to a better future for Urdu
    in India than exists today: the Delhi government conferred the status of a 2nd
    official language on Urdu in 2002 (about time! in U.P. too, I think it was the
    Samajwadi party that conferred 2nd lang status on Urdu, in 1991 or so), which
    has contributed to a mini-upsurge in textbooks, etc., coming back into print,
    and even new ones being printed (and the incongruity of seeing Urdu used in new
    street signs (in areas where no-one can read it :-), and hardly any Urdu where
    one might expect people to actually be able to read it!).  Obviously U.P.'s numbers
    cannot be matched by Delhi, but the combination of greater visibility for the
    national capital, relative prosperity (including an influx of wealthy Kashmiris
    following 1989), and a state government that has done more than most on this front
    , lead me to believe that Delhi is playing a lead role in this respect, at least
    in the North. In 2006 Penguin Books for the first time actually published an Urdu
    novel in India (a massive work called \"Kai Chand The Sar-e-Aasmaan\", set in
    the Delhi of the Mughal twilight, but also later in into the nineteenth and twentieth
    centuries); then in recent years the media group Rashtriya Sahara launched an
    Urdu paper from Delhi, with pretty good production values, color photos, etc."

  content: PS-- on that Rashtriya Sahara newspaper, I was quite pleased to see it
    occupy its place with other Delhi-based newspapers in the lounges of Delhi airport.  [Might
    seem odd or overblown to some, but in my defense I offer the fact that the sorts
    of Urdu newspapers one sees in (e.g.) Aurangabad, etc., are so poor, in both content
    and production value, it is thrilling to see "real" newspapers.  And yet, Urdu
    being Urdu, even the serious Siasat, in its entertainment section, is not above
    referring to Aishwariya Rai as "billori aankhon waali haseena-e-azam Aishwariya
    Rai..."  Indeed.]

  content: 'Aside: while the role of the state in marginalizing Urdu afer 1947 is
    well-known and documented, the indifference of even Muslim elites is quite shocking.  Far
    too many well-educated Muslim Indians of my acquaintance, inclined to complain
    that the state is neglecting Urdu etc., have taken no steps to educate their children
    in the language.  Thus Bhopal, with a very sizable prosperous Muslim middle-class
    and affluent class, just has a lot fewer people who know Urdu than one might expect
    (not just talking about young people, but even their parents).  Heck I remember
    Shabana Azmi sheepishly recounting a story on TV of how Faiz Ahmed Faiz was shocked
    when he met her and realized that she couldn''t read Urdu!  In an era when (if
    media reports are to be believed) the likes of Ms. Billori Aankhon Waali Haseena-e-Azam
    and Aamir Khan have hired tutors to learn the script in recent years, what''s
    her excuse?'

  content: "Tashakkur Sepoy Sahib  Qalandar Bhai,  See the problem in
    India is that cities are now divided into Muslim ghettoes [Old Cities] and New
    Parts. Bhopal does have a strong Muslim population and a clear Muslim character
    than most of the State capitals.  But it was like a cultural island. No
    major Muslim or Urdu-speaking urban agglomeration was around. That's why Urdu
    lost here. However, you have good libraries of Urdu and some shops also.   On
    the contrary when you are in Lucknow, you have not just the Lucknow populace but
    a town like Barabanki nearby, Kanpur jut 1-1/2 hrs and towns like Shahjehanpur,
    Sitapur and others nearby. Further qasbas like Daryadbad, Mahmoodabad, Kakori
    in Lucknow and Barabanki alone provide the push.  Mostly Urdu bookshops
    exist in such narrow bylanes that not everybody can find them. Unless you know
    that right person in that place to guide you.  Similar is the situation in Hyderabad
    and Mumbai.   See a post on my blog about one, Khurshid Book Depot in Lucknow's
    Aminabad that looks like a Kabadi ki Dukaan at first sight, and not many aware
    about it.  http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2007/06/unique-book-shop-in-lucknow.html"

  content: "I would like to add a few more points.   1. If you go to a city,
    the impression the place has on you is because of the initial 5-6 people who you
    meet and it is pure luck. On my first visit to Hyderabad Deccan, I had received
    a jolt because incidentally I met the class that mostly had relatives in US and
    are too affluent. They referred to Urdu as Hindi.   On my return, I wrote
    a marsiya of  Hyderabad and sent the sms about the City of Quli and Makhdoom turning
    into a grave of Urdu. However, in later visits, I found middle-class and lower
    middle class guys. Many of whom read Siasat, Munsif and discussed not just Ghalib
    and Iqbal  but also Zafar Iqbal and others.   So I suddenly felt energised.
      2. Chhattisgarh is the tribal dominated state in India. It had just 1.8%
    Muslims in the last census. But even there when I visited a very small town Rajnandgaon,
    the birth place of the first lady MBBS doctor of undividied India, I asked a vendor
    whether he had Urdu books. He immediately quipped, 'Ibn-e-Safi!'....I was on the
    moon. That guy in his 30s, non-Muslim, knew Ibn-e-Safi and had it in his go-down...wow....So
    it all depends on luck and chance.  3. Bhopal has over 5 lakh Muslims but
    go to the 'lost' town Sironj at some distance from Bhopal [it has no railway line
    connection] that has a population of just 25,000 that is 1/20th of Bhopal but
    you will get a culture shock. Urdu in the streets, Urdu in the homes and Urdu
    everywhere."

  content: "<i>billori aankhon waali haseena-e-azam Aishwariya Rai</i>   PMSL
    @ this!!!!!   The problem is that the Hindi press can be really tabloidy
    and communal; I used to choke on my breakfast reading Dainik Jagran and Aaj Tak
    lot - but this was in UP and I think they bring out different editions in different
    regions. Certainly these papers took a really one-sided view of communal rioting
    and a ridiculously pro-BJP line on a lot of issues.   One recent work
    on Hindi that outlines important social differentiation in the Muslim community
    in North India and which impressed me was Masawat ki Jung; I think it might be
    available in an English translation now. There is an explosion in Hindi writing
    slowly taking place; it would be good if Urdu writing broke out of the confines
    of places like Lucknow and got some encouragement. Generally the book market is
    still so small, writers and publishers need a lot of support to survive. Still,
    this is one time I would thank the fact that shudh Hindi isn't spoken and the
    influence of Urdu on film and TV ensures a famaliarity with spoken Urdu, even
    if written Urdu is falling behind."

    lovely. Thanks sepoy!  I've been able to procure both Indian (yep, they're
    from Delhi) and Pakistani (Punjab Textbook Board!) beginner readers for Urdu.
    The Urdu and Hindi university courses here really like the \"Teach Yourself\"
    series, I've found them pretty helpful too. Don't know much about real books though,
    I've found the internet helps alot.   Another really good place are public
    library book sales, the ones I go to have large \"ethnic\" collections that are
    always being revamped with newer stuff, so I ended up with a *perfect* copy of
    \"Anarkali\" by Imtiaz Ali Taj  (the one with the classic painting by Chughtai
    on the cover) for just 1$  Re Qalandar on post #5 - Ralph Russell also thought
    so too. At least that's what he wrote in 'How not to write the history of Urdu

    of the rest are autobiogrsaphies or article in Hans and other self-publications;
    I recommend:  Joothan - Omprakash Valmiki  Aalo Andhari - Baby Haldar
    - ironically this book was translated into Hindi years before it made it into
    English. A sign of the relative priorities of our english speaking elites.  Mrityunjaya
    - Shivaji Savant, though published originally in Marathi, a powerful attack on
    caste using Karna's story from the Mahabharata.   I also liked Premchand's

    and remain problematic."

  content: "Hi! This is Rashid from Karachi --- I want to talk about IBNE SAFI, the
    person who taught URDU through his books to millions of readers in this sub continent.
    \ My dear Akhil Sahab (Lucknow), i request you to visit www.wadi-e-urdu.com to
    see material on Ibne Safi.    On the morning of May 19, 2009, I visited
    the graveyard of Paposhnagar, Karachi to offer pray at the grave of great mystery
    writer of Udru literature Ibne Safi (Asrar Ahmed) who, for decades, had been the
    favorite writer of millions of his readers. He had written about 244 masterpieces
    of Imran series and Jasoosi dunya which indeed are the Gems of Urdu literature.
    &ldquo;I know you're there. A breath away's not
    far too where you are.\"   The question of Ibne Safi's
    literary merit is still unsettled, but it seems as if the tables have already
    started tilting in his favor. One obvious reason is that those who used to read
    his novels, hiding themselves from their elders under bed-sheets, are now well
    into their forties and fifties. They are teachers, professors, writers and parents.
    But they are also old friends of Safi's like Dr Abul Khair Kashfi (died May 15,
    2008), one of the few senior critics of that generation. The sum total of the
    positive bias of these people is that some of the prejudices against Safi have
    been lifted but an open acknowledgement of his literary greatness remains to be
    seen. Mr Kahild Javed (Dehli-India)  gave the names of those great western writers
    who have created detective characters in their novels/works, this includes Edgar
    Elan Po (1809-1849), Zadig by Voltaire (1694-1778), Three Musketeers by Alexandre
    Dumas (1802-1870), Human Comedy by Balzac 1799-1850), Adventures of Cabb Williams
    by William Garden , Moonstone by Wilkie Collins (1824-1889), Bleak House by Charles
    Dickens (1812-1870), A Gun for Sale by Graham Green etc. Many literary personnel
    generously admired Ibne Safi including Poet, Ajmad Islam Amjad, Columnist Hasan
    Nisar, Writer Bushra Rehman, Indian Poet/Writer Javed Akhtar (in an interview
    to Ms. Munni Kabir), Dr. Gopi Chand Narang etc. However, at a seminar in Mumbai
    in 2007, legendary Urdu writer Intizar Husain, who apparently tried to shock the
    audience with the comment that he 'had neither read Ibne Safi
    nor felt he was important enough', invited flak for his comments.
    There was severe criticism of the comment on the stage itself. Several litterateurs
    reminded Intezar Hussain that though one may be entitled to his personal views,
    and his literary status apart, Ibne Safi can't be simply dismissed
    as just another writer.       Regards  RASHID ASHRAF"

<p>Urdu Bazaar lies adjacent to the Old City and is easily one of the most congested parts of the city. At the one end is Punjab University's Old Campus:<br />

And it's slew of street vendors of archaic shastras and sutras (WINDOWs to Kama).<br />

<p>And on the other end lies the outerwalls of the Old City:<br />

<p>Urdu Bazaar bleeds into a number of other markets - from Surgical instruments to Fish to Optical. And, as befitting for such a medley, is utterly jam-packed. Here, for example, is one of the streets leading in to the market:<br />

<p>And here is the one of the exit streets. On a given day:<br />

<p>The beauty is, of course, the sheer diversity of transportation since large quantities of raw materials (reams upon reams of paper, glue, cardboard) and scholarly output (beautifully bounded volumes) are struggling to find space with cars, scooters, motorcycles and rickshaws.</p>

<p>The chaos on the streets and alleyways is almost a welcome distraction as compared to the chaos of hundreds of small bookstores and publishing houses which take up residence in Urdu Bazaar. My favorite, however, provides this nice view:<br />

<p>I was looking for something specific in my few trips there. And having absolutely no luck. A few booksellers, after gazing at my incredulous face (registering the fact that they did not carry one of the central Urdu writer of the early twentieth century), told me to go to one or two particular booksellers. Why them? Because "they carry Indian <i>maal</i> (merchandise)". And so they did. I discovered an entire underground network of booksellers who sell "Indian" books are, subsequently, considered unholy by many. Not only that, I discovered that the majority of Urdu historical or literary critical work was available "only in imports" since "No one in Pakistan does Urdu, bhai. It is all over there. Kids here don't even read the newspaper in Urdu." </p>
<p>Now, having read this really long preamble, read DK's email and then laugh at the worlds we inhabit:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So, I decided that I was going to take an intro Urdu class this fall, and went to the Urdu bazaar yesterday opposite the Jama masjid to pick up some books that the instructor told me to look for, published by the National Council for the Promotion of Urdu Language. I am there to pick up some kids' books, for reading practice once I have learnt the basics of the script. So I ask a bunch of shopkeepers, explain what I want. First of all, they all send me to various other shops, saying *that one* will surely have what I want. Nobody admits to having any NCPUL publications. One guy actually publishes kids' books himself, so I ask him about them. He rubbishes my desire to buy some books even before my lessons have begun. Why? he says. Wait till you've begun, then come back. I tell him I don't live in Delhi, and my teacher said... Never mind the teacher, he says. Come back in a few months. This carries on for a while before I say, you're right. I will come back in a few months. </p>
<p>The shopkeeper next door insists I go back to this fellow, and when I tell him that he doesn't want to sell me his books, says, "Bewaqoof. Madam, woh aisaa hi hai." But he doesn't show me any kids' storybooks either. Like I'm asking for some Urdu softporn. Sends me off to the Anjuman-e-taraqqi-e-Urdu shop, which is shocked that I'm asking them about NCPUL. I persist; insist on not leaving unless they show me some storybooks. He throws me a few. I ask him about any Hindi-se-Urdu, Urdu-through-English guides. After several hems and haws, he says, dekhta hoon. shaayad kuchh hoga. A resentful trickle slowly turns into gentle flow - CM Naim's Urdu I and II; Gopi Chand Narang's Urdu readers, workbooks, etc etc - all NCPUL publications!!!! After hotly denying that any such thing exists, let alone that he should carry any of it, the man is stocked to the gills with NCPUL. I buy 5 story books, two readers; the whole thing costs me less than 300 Rs.</p>
<p>I file a prayer in the direction of the masjid, come back and eat two samosas and have a chai, with a beedi.</p>
<p>Am excited about learning Urdu!</p></blockquote>
