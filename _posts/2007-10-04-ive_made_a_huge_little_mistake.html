  content: Lapata, you mean the watercolor didn't greet the varnish as liberators?
    I thought it would be a slam dunk case. Well, at least our childrens do learns
    for the next time. (Or... <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21107443/" rel="nofollow">not</a>.)

<p>The moral of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lapata/sets/72157602253881488/">this tale</a>, my friends, is never use an acrylic-based varnish with watercolors.  Is it any mistake it happened to the First Family? <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/lapata/1484404255/in/set-72157602253881488/' title='Christmas in August 2'><img src='http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/xmas_august_new.jpg' alt='Christmas in August 2' /></a>Could this be inadvertent acrylic voodoo?</p>
