  content: BUT why to denounce critics as such. Every criticism is valid, and should
    be welcomed, provided it's bereft of vulgarity and misogyny. Is it not? Why to
    get unnecessarily emotional? Rather, it becomes incumbent upon the poet and their
    awarders to talk more and more about poetics so that uninitiated like me gain
    some ability to peep into poetry

<p><strong>A NOTE IS A NOTE IS A NOTE</strong></p>
<p>Twenty-five-year-old Hindi poet Shubham Shree is in the eye of a poetic storm. Her poem &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Poetry Management&acirc;&euro;&trade; was selected for a prestigious award established in the name of the late poet Bharat Bhushan Agarwal for 2016 by the well-known poet and short story writer Uday Prakash, one of the jury members. The selection gave birth to a huge uproar on social media, with a number of people damning the poem because it apparently mocked the business of writing poetry in a world full of careerism, pragmatism and worldly wisdom. The propaganda was so vicious&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;bordering on vulgarity and misogyny&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;that some senior poets who are active on Facebook, etc., had to come forward to defend the young poet and poem in question. The entire episode became disgusting, not to mention depressing, for the young poet.</p>
<p>Shubham Shree has been a research scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University, a renowned institution, much maligned in the recent time by the Bharatiya Janata Party Government in India and many communal ultra-rightist organizations affiliated with it. She has a number of brilliant poems to her credit. Most of her poems deal with the inner world of the Hindi academia, leftist politics, male chauvinistic behaviours and radical feminist discourse. Much to the chagrin of the bosses in Hindi academic world, she has kept dissecting the reality behind the mask of scholarship at the level of higher education. Irony, dark humour, questioning and extremely playful language have been her weapons of dissection. With these, she has created a niche for herself in a short time while remaining aloof from the literary hullaballoo. The uniqueness of her questioning is evident in one of her much-discussed poems, in which she asserts that the cleaning staff in the university refuses to handle the menstrual pads of the girl students unless they are completely covered in newspaper, while nobody has a problem with underclothes full of the stains of male semen. 'Rather,' she writes, 'there are many hymns in praise of semen.&acirc;&euro;&trade;</p>
<p>Shubham&acirc;&euro;&trade;s poem &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Poetry Management&acirc;&euro;&trade; deploys some of her favourite weapons. On the face of it, the poem does mock poetry itself and highlights the fruitlessness of the act of writing poetry as it does not serve any worldly purpose. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an &acirc;&euro;&tilde;unprofessional profession.&acirc;&euro;&trade; Then the poem proceeds towards a playful fantasy of imagining the importance and might of poetry where everything, from the SENSEX to all of world politics is impossibly overshadowed by poetry--which in the end becomes &acirc;&euro;&tilde;bullshit&acirc;&euro;&trade;. This makes the poem a hilarious, and absurd, experience. But this is just the surface of the poem and behind it, we can perceive the intense irony at work. However funny this construct may appear, its bricks and mortar are made of empathy and compassion for poetry. Reading between the lines, it scoffs at the insensitivity of the world around us, which is highly competitive, management&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;oriented and opportunistic. It brings to light the futility of managing poetry in the world of business management. We can hear the lamentation of poetry itself beneath the comical fa&Atilde;&sect;ade of the poem. As in many of her other poems, here too Shubham breaks away from the traditional, accepted, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;literary&acirc;&euro;&trade; mould of poetry, and tries to create a structure that is &acirc;&euro;&tilde;non-literary&acirc;&euro;&trade; and &acirc;&euro;&tilde;non-poetic', and is more prosaic, more functional and theatrical. What we get in the end is an intense critique of our times, where the MBA has become the central concern of the humankind.</p>
<p>Sadly, those who misunderstand&Acirc;&nbsp; &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Poetry Management' have simply shown how business management has clouded our ability to see beneath the surface of language and read between the lines.</p>
