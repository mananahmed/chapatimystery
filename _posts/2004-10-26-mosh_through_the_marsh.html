  content: "Thank you for sharing this!  I thought the old spirit of protest music
    was long gone.  I had been listening to John Fogerty. :-)  This is more timely
    and aggressive.  Eminem has always had great talent, IMO."

    while it's been making the rounds on the internets, let's see if it makes it to MTV & BET in *extremely* heavy rotation.

    sepoy's "eminem punk'd everybody" theory aside, he should have opened with this as the first single from the new album. it takes more than 1 week to have a buzz generated, effect seen, etc. mess with jacko AFTER the election, foo! especially since he advocates "building an army" to oust bush. uh, a lot of states' election boards need at least a month's notice in order to register, slim.

    shoulda/woulda/coulda's aside, here's to hoping i'm naysaying. good to see em using his talent and influence for something that matters. not to say fart jokes and "this celebrity mantle sucks while i hate my mom, faggot" content doesn't. :o)

    i've always said that eminem has immense talent and a beautiful mind. the song hasnt gotten any airplay here in canada cuz i never heard it till i found it at CM and just downloaded it. more ppl need to listen to eminem's socio-political commentary : "middle america, now its a tragedy, now its so sad to see, an uper class city, have this happening..."

    unadulterated genius.

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnn.tv/videos/video.php?id=27">video</a> is amazing [also <a href="http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/interscope/eminem/encore/video/mosh-rev/000_mosh-rev.asx">here</a> or <a href="http://movies10.archive.org/3/movies/Mosh2/GNN_Mosh_bb2.mov">here</a> or <a href="http://boss.streamos.com/qtime/interscope/eminem/encore/video/mosh-rev/300_mosh-rev.mov">here</a>]. The lyrics are harsh and powerful (<i>strap him with an AK 47, let him go/ Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way</i>).<br />
This is what F 9/11 hoped it could be. Eminem's <i>Mosh</i> could very well be our anthem, our <i>Times They Are A-Changing</i>, our last rallying cry in this last week. I need a mp3 quick. </p>
<p>Welcome to your October surprise, Mr. Rove.</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif"><br />
[I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America<br />
And to the Republic for which it stands<br />
One nation under God<br />
Indivisible?<br />
It feels so good to be back..]</p>
<p>Scrutinize every word, memorize every line<br />
I spit it once, refuel, reenergize, and rewind<br />
I give sight to the blind, mind sight through the mind<br />
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time<br />
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as<br />
I say to fight you take it as Im gonna whip someone's ass<br />
If you don't understand don't even bother to ask<br />
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past<br />
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has<br />
Or at least shows no difficulty multi task<br />
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash<br />
Entrepreneur who has held long too few more rap acts<br />
Who has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half<br />
Of his career typical manure moving past that<br />
Mister kiss his ass crack, he's a class act<br />
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back</p>
<p>Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br />
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br />
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br />
Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br />
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br />
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br />
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br />
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors</p>
<p>To the people up top, on the side and the middle,<br />
Come together, let's all bomb and swamp just a little<br />
Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back<br />
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black<br />
Don't matter what color, all that matters is we gathered together<br />
To celebrate for the same cause, no matter the weather<br />
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better<br />
They ain't gonna stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more then ever,<br />
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go,<br />
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know<br />
Stomp, push up, mush, fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home come on just . . .</p>
<p>Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br />
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br />
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br />
Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br />
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br />
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br />
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br />
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on</p>
<p>Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us,<br />
Mosh pits outside the oval office<br />
Someone's trying to tell us something, maybe this is God just saying<br />
we're responsible for this monster, this coward, that we have empowered<br />
This is Bin Laden, look at his head nodding,<br />
How could we allow something like this, Without pumping our fist<br />
Now this is our, final hour<br />
Let me be the voice, and your strength, and your choice<br />
Let me simplify the rhyme, just to amplify the noise<br />
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply it by six<br />
Teen million people are equal of this high pitch<br />
Maybe we can reach Al Qaida through my speech<br />
Let the President answer on high anarchy<br />
Strap him with AK-47, let him go<br />
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way<br />
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our soil<br />
No more psychological warfare to trick us to think that we ain't loyal<br />
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero<br />
Look in his eyes, it's all lies, the stars and stripes<br />
They've been swiped, washed out and wiped,<br />
And Replaced with his own face, mosh now or die<br />
If I get sniped tonight you'll know why, because I told you to fight</p>
<p>So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness<br />
As I provide just enough spark, that we need to proceed<br />
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength,<br />
Come with me, and I won't steer you wrong<br />
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog<br />
Till the light, at the end, of the tunnel, we gonna fight,<br />
We gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march through the swamp<br />
We gonna mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors</p>
<p>[Eminem speaking angrily]<br />
And as we proceed, to mosh through this desert storm, in these closing statements, if they should argue, let us beg to differ, as we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army, to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our president, for the present, and mosh for the future of our next generation, to speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Will it get air-play?</p>
