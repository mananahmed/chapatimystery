  content: "The government rescue operation was very apathetic. The info I gathered
    was from people who were at the site of disaster in Islamabad.  Some people
    are alive in the ruble and are trapped for more than 12 hrs, they have made calls
    from their cell phones."

    Its unfair to criticise the government this harshly. A tradegy of this magnitude is unprecedented - and in my opinion given the circumstances the government did react swiftly. heck, we belong to a third world country and you cant be expecting a proper disaster managment plan and unit.

    In trying times, it is better to aid and help and push in any way one can, rather just criticising and sitting around.

  content: "Ayesha! Thanks for your comments.  I agree the nature of disaster is
    huge and we are talking about developing country. If I were in Paksitan you would
    have literally seen me digging and reaching out. At this moment I am just trying
    to mobilize resources with the help of friends.  However, it made me very uncomfertable

    progress? Yasin"
