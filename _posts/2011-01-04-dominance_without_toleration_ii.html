  content: "@omar,   regarding your article.  great analysis but two points.\r\n\r\n1.
    \ Chinese worker were also accused of blasphemy when they were taken\r\nhostages.
    \ So this will no go away when America leaves.  Don't worry\r\nmost of the minorities
    will leave anyway.  How does Pakistan reconcile\r\nwith Chinese eating pork and
    loving dogs.  Yet Chinese are not consider evil.\r\nThat will be your next challenge
    as China has take over Pakistan inch by inch.\r\nHow will you like your new master.\r\n2.
    \ Capitalism is how civilization works meaning a pyramid scheme.\r\nIt is not
    a modern construct.  Only thing modern world has brought is\r\ncheap fuel and
    food thus population going from 1 billion to 7 billion.\r\nModern world won't
    last but another 20 years as the Oil disappears.   \r\nSo you are not fixing it
    long term."

  content: "\" most people in this country .....are moderate \".\r\nAnd most people
    in Pakistan, the moderate people, are silent, for very obvious reasons.\r\nIt's
    reasonable to  believe that during the grotesque reigns of Stalin, Hitler, Pol
    Pot and Saddam Hussein, other than in periods of national emergency, most of the
    ruled were moderates who would have changed the regime; they too were silent,
    for the same reasons.\r\nOn the one hand, the moderates in Pakistan are fortunate,
    in that the civil authorities are not supporting the tyranny, which is not to
    say that they are opposing it either, but there is not a government run nazi gestapo
    to enforce the tyranny. \r\nOn the 0ther hand, the Pakistani tyranny is enforced,
    not as a human ideology which can be debated and debunked, but as Allah's immutable
    word and way, by the sizable minority for whom that is true.\r\nOpposing Hitler
    had a higher probability of ultimate success.\r\nThere were many millions of Germans
    who became ex nazis - they had come to realize the bankruptcy of that ideology.\r\nThere
    are tens of millions of Russians who have become ex communists - they have come
    to realize the bankruptcy of that ideology.\r\nNot that there were not some positive
    aspects to those two ideologies, but overall, they were damaging templates around
    which to organize a society.\r\nWill I live to see the day that  tens of millions
    of Pakistanis become ex ''''''''''''''''''; is it possible they will see that
    there are other,  far superior, templates around which to organize a society ?\r\nFrankly,
    I don't think so.\r\nEven those who write here, who are certainly educated, bright
    people, cannot bring themselves to face the truth. \r\nGermany, today, does not
    allow the teaching of naziism, not even a moderate variety; moderate nazi ideology
    taught in school to children will produce a percentage of extremist nazi young
    adults, and it only took a minority of extremist nazi adults to take over Germany
    the last time.\r\nHow many of those who study a moderate version of the ideology
    that tyrranizes Pakistan read and re-read the books, and come to the conclusion
    that their moderate parents or teachers are not real '''''''''''' , because they
    are not doing what they have been specifically instructed to do.\r\nAnd how many
    of those youngsters, in the west at least, have decided to show their parents
    and teachers what a real '''''''''' is, through their actions, actions which follow
    instructions that they are not supposed, according to the moderates, to follow.\r\nI
    don't want to be hurtful or disrespectful to those here, but that is how i see
    things and i'd be interested to read your thoughts."

  content: "Dear Scarf,\r\n\r\nAs I see it, a lot of the debate over Taseer's assassination
    and the blasphemy law actually obscures a more important tension; that of the
    tension between a textual and legalistic interpretation of the religion and a
    more reason-based and 'humanistic' vision. Unfortunately there seem to be very
    few people in Pakistan who can engage with the massive number of issues at play
    here comprehensively, sensitively and authoratatively. It is my humble yet urgent
    wish that more diaspora academics would come and spend some time in Pakistan and
    think these things out. \r\n\r\nthanks."

  content: "When those favouring a textual and legalistic interpretation of the religion
    are happy, willing and able to encourage their followers to murder others, to
    murder those who are interested in discussing the possibility of a more reason-based
    and 'humanistic' vision, it is unlikely that any of the diaspora academics are
    likely to return to Pakistan, save those who are pleased with such murders.\r\nAs
    I understand things, academics living in the diaspora who encourage a more reason-based
    and 'humanistic' vision of the religion are being threatened, and feel threatened,
    where they presently live. They are most unlikely to take the further, huge risk,
    of moving to Pakistan.\r\nWhen, I ask, is it time to abandon ship ?\r\nWhether
    one uses a Buddhist, secular, Confucian, Christian or Shinto template around which
    to organize society, or any one of dozens of others, there is plenty of choice."

<p>"Most people in this country — and I am not talking about the lunatic fringe — are moderate."</p>
<p>Those words echo; now that the one who uttered them, the Governor of Punjab (the most populous state in Pakistan), <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1032592.ece">lies dead</a> at the hands of his own guard. <a href="http://www.salmaantaseer.com/main.aspx">Salmaan Taseer</a> was many things, but most recently, he was a champion of a particular strand of liberal, secular discourse in a country where such voices are dwindling down to nothing. He was a minority because he chose to stand next to the Christian and Hindu minorities who are denied basic protection in their own nation.</p>
<p>This is a great loss. Let us remember the man, for what he chose to do and say. This is an excerpt from an interview he gave on <a href="http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2010/12/interview-salmaan-taseer-governor-of-punjab/"> December 23, 2010</a> in the <em>Newsline</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: Why did you take up Aasiya Bibi's case?</p>
<p>A: Aasiya Bibi's case is particularly relevant. She is a woman who has been incarcerated for a year-and-a half on a charge trumped up against her five days after an incident where people who gave evidence against her were not even present. So this is a blatant violation against a member of a minority community. I, like a lot of right-minded people, was outraged, and all I did was to show my solidarity. It is the first time in the history of the Punjab that a governor has gone inside a district jail, held a press conference and stated clearly that this is a blatant miscarriage of justice and that the sentence that has been passed is cruel and inhumane. I wanted to take a mercy petition to the president, and he agreed, saying he would pardon Aasiya Bibi if there had indeed been a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Q: You have been criticised for circumventing the legal process.</p>
<p>A: Yes, particularly by a television talk show host. I would like to ask that host if some maulvi accused her of blasphemy and she spent a year-and-a half in jail and was then offered a presidential pardon, would she turn around and say, &ldquo;no wait until my appeal has been heard.&rdquo; This kind of 'mummy daddy' approach is probably fine for others, but I wonder if she would apply it to herself. I don't think I have circumvented anything; all I have done is to draw everyone's attention to this case. I have also showed my solidarity with minority communities who are being targeted by this law and, in doing so, I have sent across a strong message.</p>
<p>I have received thousands of messages from people from all walks of life. The result can only be good. This law that no one dared speak about is now being discussed, criticised and its repeal sought. I have heard anchors, journalists, members of civil society, people like Ghamdi, Imran Khan even Rana Sanaullah and many more saying amendments are required. The important thing to remember is that this is a man-made law, not a God-made one. What I find particularly distasteful is that when you speak of amendment, people assume you condone the crime. If I am against the death sentence, it does not mean I condone murder.</p>
<p>Q: Do you advocate repeal of those provisions in the Pakistan Penal Code better known as the Blasphemy Law?</p>
<p>A: If you want my personal opinion, I don't like this law at all. I understand we are working in a coalition government and that being the case what we can do is to amend the law in such a way that the maker of a false accusation is tried under the same law. There should also be a proper filtration process where someone like a DCO should confirm that there is a case to answer. This will help ensure that pressure from maulvis and fanatics does not result in the victimisation of helpless people. One of the maulvis demonstrating against me said that they killed Arif Iqbal Bhatti, a judge who released someone accused of blasphemy. Surely, at the very least, he should be tried for incitement to murder.</p>
<p>Q: Yes, but the perpetrators get away&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</p>
<p>A: The real problem is that the government is not prepared to face religious fanaticism head on. This also gives us a bad name in the world.</p></blockquote>
