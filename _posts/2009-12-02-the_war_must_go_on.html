  content: "Virtualy every Pak centric blog today is talking and criticising the Obama
    speech and his afpak strategy.  But there is no practical and realistic alternative
    being talked about which would be not only more Pak friendly but also solve the
    issues for both Pak and the USA.  Are there any alternatives put forward
    by any Pakistani experts on how to handle the Afghan and Taliban issue ?"

  content: I think you are being too harsh. I think it was a good speech and its the
    best strategy possible at this time. There is no such thing as police work or
    supporting education if there is no security (no govt. in charge). The Afghan
    govt has to establish bare minimum control over Afghanistan, otherwise civil war,
    anarchy and export of criminality and terrorism will continue. Pakistan has to
    re-establish control over its tribal areas and stop supporting international terrorist
    networks. These are all practical and necessary goals (as long as we wish to continue
    in the present paradigm of nation states and international relations).  If this
    works, then the whole region will benefit. If it does not work, the US will suffer
    a setback but the region will suffer much worse.

    extent, anyway)? and i don't know what \"export of criminality\" means.   when
    has pakistan had control that it needs to \"re-establish\" it? and what international
    terrorist networks are we talking about? I thought they were mainly local ones,
    no?  \"if it works\"..err..remind me again, what *exactly* is the aim here,
    what is \"it\"?  As for practical and necessary goals I'd suggest: stop
    supporting dictators (General Z, Mush, etc) and radical groups in the name of
    'national interest' and think a bit about that old-fashioned word justice."

  content: "I too am irked by constant Alexander the Great references. A serious problem,
    I think, is the US seeing this from a US-centered perspective. They think that
    they're the target, when really they were injected into an ongoing 30-year civil
    war. This type of thinking will create disasterous problems for civilians worldwide,
    especially Afghanistan.  The US and the West are major players, but only
    one part of a much larger conflict, and I think their ignorance about the situation
    as a whole dimishes chances of a lasting peace.  All the people of Afghanistan
    must feel as though they can trust and hold their government accountable. Which,
    right now they can't, but more focuss, whether foreign or domestic, should be
    given to building a viable, democratic nation.  There also should a serious
    reconsideration about these so-called \"ethnic divides\" and people need to jettison
    that ethno-based/racial/stupid thinking that was encouraged, and to some degree
    impossed some 300 years ago.  Obama's team should seriously apply more efforts
    to helping Afghans bring peace to Afghanistan by healthcare, education, and employment.
    The world community at large, with Muslim governments at the forefront, should
    also work together to defeat violent Islamists.  Thought I guess that'd
    take healthcare, education, and jobs as well."

  content: "I think the US is already trying to step away from the army and cultivate
    a civilian democratic leadership in Pakistan. But their short term interests constantly
    pull them back to the army, which is the institution that can help or hinder Afghan
    operations, can go after or support jihadi groups, and so on.  I am generally
    critical of the ham-handed interference of the US embassy and I think sections
    of the pentagon and CIA are just too used to dealing with military dictators and
    right wing death squads, so they tend to go with what they know. But even they
    have gradually figured out that the Pakistani army is not the same as the Argentinian
    army. It has a long relationship with international islamist terrorists and many
    of its officers are genuinely committed to a vision of Islamic solidarity that
    does not go along with mercenary operations on behalf of the CIA. So I would submit
    that Pakistan is now a special case where EVEN the US security establishment is
    willing to move away from their fondly remembered Latin American model and actually
    supports democracy and even tolerates progressive ideals. 2. Afghanistan is
    a side show. The real center of gravity of international Islamist terrorism is
    still Pakistan. That is where the wannabe terrorists go to train, that is where
    the most determined leaders of this network are in hiding. The purpose of the
    Afghan surge is not so much to \"pacify\" Afghanistan as to convince the Pakistani
    army that they should give up the \"good taliban\" and the \"good jihadis\" just
    as they have started to fight the \"bad ones\". Once the Pakistani army is unambiguously
    aligned against the salafist'jihadi network, America has no further interest in
    Afghanistan. Or rather, America's job in afghanistan will no longer be a big problem.
    If Pakistan no longer offers sanctuary to the \"good taliban\", then the reconcilable
    elements will make a deal with Karzai and the rest will not be an insoluble problem
    for the new Afghan army (which is far more effective than Tariq Ali has been led
    to believe). Even if deals fall apart and fighting restarts, it will be contained
    within Afghanistan and will be settled in Afghan style. 3.  The gentleman who
    thought there is already anarchy in Afghanistan has obviously not studied afghanistan
    too closely. Actually even now, with the taliban insurgency in full swing, there
    is peace in most of afghanistan. Some of it is peaceful because the taliban are
    in charge and some of it is peaceful because the govt or local warlords are in
    charge, the actual violence is limited by recent Afghan standards. Millions of
    boys and girls are going to school. Several Universities are functioning (and
    functioning better than anytime since 1990). Many hospitals have been rebuilt
    and the medical college in Kabul is fully functional. Several corps of the new
    Afghan army have overcome initial problems and no longer have the kind of desertion
    rate that plagues the police. I can go on and on, but you really need to be willing
    to step out of the \"open democracy\" echo chamber a little bit..."

  content: I will add that i know some of you are pacifists and will not support ANY
    war. I respect that  and admire that, but unless you have a Gandhian alternative
    means of action (which i admire and respect) the best you can do is object to
    all violent organized groups (armies and terrorists) and not pick and choose which
    violent group has "justice" on their side. That argument may seem straightforward
    within our own echo chamber, but tends to become complicated when alternative
    views are actually taken into consideration...

  content: My point is that this toll is small compared to the last civil war and
    nothing compared to the war we will see if American hurriedly pulls out. The best
    option for the Afghan people (and the Pakistani people) is that Obama's plan works
    and a functional Afghan regime is in place (and so is a Pakistani establishment
    clearly inclined against the jihadis). I also think the US and its allies are
    doing more to help the civilian population than the Taliban or their friends.

  content: "Nikolai, South Africa suffered 3,000 violent deaths a month in 2005. Venezuela,
    Brazil Colombia, are all incredibly violent places. Mexico suffers more than 1,000
    violent deaths a month.  Afghanistan is far less violent than many countries,
    including Pakistan, on a per capita basis.  Iraq had 3,500 violent deaths
    during some months in 2006. In November, Iraq had 90 civilian violent deaths.
    Annualized, that is 1080/year. Afghanistan is roughly as violent as Iraq is for
    civilians. The problem is less Afghan civilian deaths than the enormous numbers
    of Afghan National Police [ANP]  and Afghan National Army [ANP] getting killed
    and wounded.  Omar, Tariq Ali knows how effective the ANA is at fighting;
    Tariq Ali also knows that in every poll conducted since 2001, the ANA was by far
    the most popular and respected Afghan institution among Afghans, including Pashtun
    Afghans. These are the two reasons \"WHY\" he so strongly supports violent attacks
    against the ANA.  Pakistanis need to realize that Pakistani bashing of the
    ANA fuels Afghan anger at Pakistanis. The ANA will be around long after the ISAF
    troops leave. Pakistan needs to reach out to the Afghan government and ANA; and
    demonstrate Pakistan's desire to help them. Perhaps Pakistan could offer lecturers
    to teach in Afghan universities, other civilian reconstruction workers, and trainers
    for the Afghan National Security Forces. This type of reconciliation gesture might
    alleviate tensions between Afghans and Pakistanis."

  content: "\"Civilian aid, infrastructure, health, and education should be given
    as much attention as the war.\" How?  GIRoA annual revenue = $600 million
    versus long term expenditure of over $6,000 million per year.  Afghanistan's
    education budget alone is substantially greater than total GIRoA revenues.  -Afghanistan
    has 45,000 freshman in college now versus about one thousand in 2001. Many of
    these college freshman are woman. -Afghanistan had 2.5 million girls and 4.5
    million boys in school now versus almost no girls and one to two million boys
    in school in 2001.  This is just the unsustainable Afghan education industrial
    complex. Let alone the electricity industrial complex. Kabul has 24 hours of electricity
    today, but can't afford to pay for the electricity generated (except via international
    grants.)    Afghanistan has a record number of roads, but not nearly enough
    ANA and ANP to protect them; and no revenue base to maintain the roads over time.
    In fact a major contributor to the deterioration of Afghan security is that the
    Afghanistan's limited ANA and ANP are being redirected to protecting the roads
    from protecting the Afghan people. This has directly lead to much less security
    for ordinary Afghans.  Massive spending by Afghanistan's NGO and foreign
    aid industrial complexes have substantially boosted Afghan inflation, driven up
    the wages of educated Afghans; in the process harming many poor Afghans living
    on fixed incomes;  and made Afghanistan almost completely dependent on ongoing
    massive international grants as far as the eye can see.  Nikolai, I am with
    you more than you know. I would love to see more foreign aid to Afghanistan. But
    those who oppose increasing foreign aid to Afghanistan bring up these challenges.
    How would you, a friend of the Afghan people, address them?"

    give it the respect and aid of an enduring institution.\" I think the Afghans
    would appreciate the gesture. Even better would be a Pakistani proposal for joint
    ANA and ANP training with India, Iran and China through NTM-A, to ensure that
    the ANA and ANP are trained on a single consistent doctrine.  YS_1, as long
    as the international community continues to fund, train, advise and equip it;
    why do you think the ANA can be defeated in most of Afghanistan? Granted the ANA
    might retreat from large parts of the South and smaller parts of the East if it
    lacked the size and capacity to secure all of Afghanistan.  Ann Jones, who
    you cited, is not familiar with modern militaries. She went to an ANP training
    camp and hung out with some ANP, and then wrote an article about not the ANP,
    but the ANA. Make sense of that.  Ann Jones anecdotally knew a few people who
    had gone to ANA boot camp a couple of times under different names without joining
    the  ANA. She then extrapolates from this without bothering to research the ANA
    on her own, or talk to other people familiar with the ANA. The way I see it, the
    ANA boot camp did its job and kept suboptimal soldiers from joining the ANA.  As
    of October, 2009, the AWOL rate of the ANA was 5%. {Although this low number is
    achieved by allowing a liberal leave policy.}  YS_1, research the authors
    of the articles you read. Also beware of excessive generalizations of the ANA,
    given the variation in ANA quality between units.  YS_1, Ann Jones wouldn't
    have been wrong had she been writing about the ANP. The outgoing commander of
    CSTC-A/NTM-A said a month ago that the ANP was four to five years behind the ANA.
    This is a polite way of saying that the ANP overall (with large notable exceptions)
    is not doing well.  I suspect that if Pakistan and India jointly offered
    to assist with ANP training (which is far more needed than ANA training), this
    offer would be appreciated."

    army if they make an attempt at dislodging the Quetta shura which operates--quite
    literally--across a ravine from the Command and Staff College.   In any
    case, I suspect the Taliban phenomenon isn't  a localized issue for either Pakistan
    or Afghanistan. Thousands of Pakistanis fought in the civil war in Afghanistan
    alongside the Taliban and Taliban-like activities (clamor for sharia courts, shutting
    down video shops, etc.) began in earnest in Balochistan, the NWFP and FATA around
    1997.  Prior to the fall of Kabul in 1996, the mosques in Balochistan held funeral
    prayers almost daily for dead bodies returning from the \"jihad\" in Afghanistan.
    Meanwhile, donation (chanda) drives allowed many more to participate vicariously
    in the jihad for the Sharia state."

    \  This is purely anecdotal, but the leftish academics I know in the US either

    much better informed and very deep thinkers, but I am talking about someone who
    teaches English or American History or Arabic literature very well, but bases
    his or her opinions of Afghanistan  on Tariq Ali and George Monbiot level reportage. I
    have had discussions with otherwise intelligent and well informed people who seem
    to believe that the ANA is some kind of collection of evil mercenaries, recruited
    from \"lumpen elements\" and to be regarded ENTIRELY as an occupation force working
    for the hated occupiers of the brave Afghan nation. When told that this is not
    really true, they simply pick up their Tariq Ali book and leave. Its sad. (I
    am aware that a similarly dismal situation prevails on the Glenn Beck extreme,

  content: "Khalid,   The international Islamist terrorists are a loose but interconnected
    network of Islamists who came together in Pakistan during and after the Soviet
    occupation and mostly functioned under the supervision of (sympathetic) Pakistani
    army officers. The army high command completely succumbed to a relatively small
    number of Jihadi officers (due, in my opinion, to the extraordinary incompetence
    of our senior officers and the terribly short sighted decision to educate them
    in National Defence College, where they picked up notions of \"strategy\" and
    \"national interest\" that primed them for being made into utter fools by their
    jihadi peers) and gave them free rein throughout the nineties. During this
    time, half a million men were trained by various jihadi organizations and a nationwide
    culture of jihad was allowed to take root in rural punjab as well as in the less
    fashionable sections of major cities. It was mostly off the radar of the small
    class from which we all hail, but it was a very major social shift. In the tribal
    areas as well as in Pakhtun Karachi and in most of South Punjab, it was easier
    to get justice from these people than from the existing state. To avoid international
    pressure and to avoid upsetting the sensibilities of the English speaking classes,
    the endgame of this jihadi enterprise was never publicized outside their own groups.
    \ The extensive links of the army with the taliban and of the taliban with these
    jihadi networks were also kept off the front pages. All jihadists were never
    under Pak army control and some Arab extremists based in Afghanistan attacked
    the US, probably without Pak army knowledge.  The US invasion that followed was
    assisted by the Pak army under the assumption that the Americans will one day
    leave and the good taliban will then come back. For that purpose, the good taliban
    were not hampered in their escape and sanctuary in Pakistan. Under American pressure,
    some jihadi groups were shut down while others were told to lie low. Unfortunately,
    the army then discovered that the jihadis were using the army more than the army
    was using the jihadis and many of them refused to lie low, leading to problems
    with the US and with India. I am not sure if the Mumbai attacks were done with
    Pak army knowledge or not, but am working on the assumption that they were NOT
    known to the army beforehand.  Members of this network have set off bombs in
    London, Barcelona, India, bali and more.  This network is now striking against
    the army, so my assumption is that the army has really started to move against
    the jihadists (except for ones like LET, which continue to accept some supervision...again,
    whether they pulled off mumbai without Pak army permission is an interesting question) And
    so on.  As you can see, in my version, leaving the jihadists alone is not really
    an option because they will not leave us alone. Their project was real, it was
    international and it would have led to war IN ANY CASE even if 9-11 had not happened
    (though the initial war may have been against India in that case). Tactical decisions
    are always open for debate, but the overall strategic issue is clear to me: the
    Pakistani state has to either openly side with the jihadists, in which case the
    anti-taliban Afghans, India, Russia, Iran and NATO will look for ways to bring
    us down (some jihadists have told me that in that case we will have Chinese support,
    though I doubt it), OR we have to take on the jihadist network by working WITH
    the Americans, the Afghans, the Indians and so on, and in the course of this,
    still safeguard national interests of a more secular nature (water, boundary disputes,
    trade disputes and so on). There is no negotiated settlement because THEY will
    not negotiate peace except as a temporary reprieve in which to build up strength.  Sorry,
    no time for references, though they exist for most of the above assertions. Anyway,
    you are free to find your own version. What is your picture of this terrorist
    network?  btw, why is it OK if they \"go with what they know\"? I think
    its not OK at all. I think the pentagon and CIA old guard who only feel comfortable
    with uniformed dictators and right wing death squads are doing a terrible disservice
    to America and are of course, a plague on the countries that they hand over to
    dictators and death squads...I do think that is not the primary mode of operations
    in Pakistan anymore."

  content: "Omar, hello. I have no idea of the networks or how 'internationalist'
    they are or were. To say that the Pakistani state or the military supported 'international
    terrorists' is, to my mind, a rather strong claim-and I'm not even sure what the
    evidence is for that or if anyone has written on it.  As far as I understand,
    the terrorist networks/jihadis were an attempt to 'bleed' India or offer 'strategic
    depth' and not, specifically, \"internationalist\" in nature.  And southern punjab
    is probably a lot more complex (I think Aeysha Siddiqa says its partly down to
    class). And I think we'd have to factor in the local sectarian angle as well.
      They would not leave us alone.:Well, at the moment, you know what, living
    in Lahore it certainly feels that NOW they won't leave us alone!  But that really
    comes on the back of years of war and drone attacks. So, I'm not sure about the
    claim. May have led to a low-level conflict, but \"war\"?Not so sure, not so sure.
    I think the jihadis were a lot more managebale before and not such a great threat
    (and certainly not an \"existential threat\", as some would like to portray them).
    For instance, to repeat the old saying: Lahore is [still] Lahore.  Omar,
    I agree with you, the fanatics are a curse and the ISI's strategy of grooming
    them has also been disastrous -that goes without saying. The question-for me-is
    whether continued violence is the best way of dealing with them. I don't think
    the tribals are, or have been, anti-Pakistani but that may now be a possibility
    and most people here are becomingly rabidly anti-American (in my opinion). In
    that sense, I don't think it's 'winnable' (to use an Americanism).   Perhaps
    we could phrase it this way: if America were to pull out of Afghanistan would
    the Pakistani \"state\" be able to crush militancy. Maybe not. But I certainly
    think they'd have a better chance (assuming the military were  really up for it,
    and assuming the Americans could pay them enough)  \"They\" will not negotiate
    peace. Not so sure and I don't know how you can say that with such confidence.
      Khair..  Thanks for the response.  Keep well,  K."

    </i>   It took some time for it to get around to Lahore and other parts
    of Pakistan and for the general indifference or the support for Taliban to melt
    away. The Taliban could always rely on manpower and funds from Pakistan and broad
    sections of Pakistan supported them for one reason or another: from the strategic
    depth of the army brass, to the Sharia as the law of the land for the lower classes.
    The Taliban franchise in Pakistan was creating trouble in Balochistan and NWFP
    well before the drone attacks as early as 1997 (unless we consider anything less
    than a suicide bomb as business as usual, or an increase in the targeting of Shias
    as boys being boys.) One can't really dissociate the developments in Pakistan
    and Afghanistan. Lest we forget, Zia was known as \"Shahid Jihad Afghanistan\"
    for a reason.   Also, wouldn't affairs between Afghanistan and Pakistan
    be considered \"international\"?"

  content: "As an American, please let me briefly discuss what the situation has historically
    looked like from the US.   After all, it can be hard to understand the actions
    of  Americans if you don't know where we're coming from.  Actually, it can be
    hard to understand the actions of Americans even if you do know where we're coming
    from, but that's another story.  The most important thing to understand
    is  that most Americans are not descendants of immigrants from India or Pakistan.
    \ They know about as much about Pakistan as the average Pakistani or Indian knows
    about France.  Maybe less.  Just as important, they don't really care about South
    Asia.  Historically, the US backed Pakistan because India was neutral, leaning
    pro-Russian, in the Cold War.  So we backed Pakistan, neither knowing nor caring
    much about it, because the Pakistanis were  the enemies of our enemies.    The
    CIA unwisely decided to back the Islamists against Russia, because the CIA didn't
    know anything about Afghanistan, but they did know that they were against the
    Russians.  Looking back now, we would probably have been better off not supporting
    the Afghan resistance against the Russians, but hindsight is often more accurate
    than foresight.    General Zia was willing to do what we wanted, for his
    own reasons, so we looked the other way regarding the various crimes he committed.
    \ After all, we fought WWII as allies of Stalin, who is generally acknowledged
    to be much worse than Zia, and the enemy of your enemy is your friend.  This
    created a small group of US specialists in Pakistan, forming what was in effect
    a Pakistan lobby.  Pakistanis, used to dealing with the Pakistan lobby, were rudely
    shocked when the US demonstrated that it didn't care about either Pakistan or
    Afghanistan after the Russians left Afghanistan in 1989.  For about a decade,
    the US was in a position to do what it wanted, which was basically to ignore Pakistan
    (and Afghanistan).  The BJP was elected in India, they were friendly to US foreign
    investment, and factions in the US decided that India could be useful in containing
    China.  Madeleine Albright noticed that Pakistan was an Islamic country unfriendly
    to Israel, armed with the atomic bomb.  This did not fill her, or other pro-Israel
    Americans, with enthusiasm.  So the US started to tilt toward India.  Then
    9/11 happened.  Contrary to what most Americans think, this was not a radical
    change in the world, but it did result in some changes in US policy.  Since Osama
    bin Laden and AQ were in Afghanistan the US suddenly became aware of Afghanistan
    again.  We backed the enemies of OSL's friends, and chased him out of Afghanistan.
    \ To be honest, I wish the Bush administration had stuck to chasing OSL, but instead
    it lost interest in OSL and became interested in Iraq.  After all, Iraq might
    have the atomic bomb soon (though the evidence was a lot more dubious than they
    admitted at the time), Saddam Hussein was also an enemy of the US (and Israel),
    and there was a lot of oil in Iraq.  The invasion of Iraq started to go badly,
    and except for the people in the US army actually sent to Afghanistan, the US
    mostly forgot Afghanistan and Pakistan again.  The situation in Iraq started
    to improve a bit in 2007, and the Democratic party candidate for President decided
    to make an issue of the Bush administration's failure to devote much effort to
    actually getting Osama bin Laden.  While we were worried about Iraq, the situation
    in Afghanistan and Pakistan had deteriorated.  Some people in the US media noticed
    that Pakistan had a fair number of already existing atomic bombs, Osama bin Laden,
    and a large number of suicidal terrorists.  This combination was not encouraging
    and another flap ensued.  I'm sure someone a little more sympathetic to
    US foreign policy could put a more attractive spin on it, but that's the way it
    looked to me in the US.   I'm hoping the US will start paying attention to what
    people actually think in India and Pakistan, learn a little history, and maybe
    start responding to what's actually going on, but I'm not particularly optimistic.
    \ But then, since I'm almost never optimistic, the fact that I'm not optimistic
    does not mean much.  It is in the interest of Pakistanis to crack down hard
    on Islamist terrorism, because they are the ones currently being blown up. For
    what it is worth, I'm willing to offer a little political support in the US for
    measures the Pakistanis think useful in this effort.  Supprt for improving education
    also makes some sense to me, so I would support it.  On the other hand, education
    also needs to be improved in the US, and the US has a ton of its own problems,
    better understood over here, to address.  For what it is worth, which is nothing,
    I also favor a reasonable, mutually agreeable, solution to the Kashmir issue between
    Pakistan and India - but I have no idea what this would be and no willingness
    to sacrifice anything to bring it about so Pakistanis would be well advised not
    to think of me as ally.  Good Luck.  Ray,"

    *impression* from what I read, see on t.v., and from the people I meet. So, yeah,
    maybe you're right. I think it's important to say that at a cultural level people
    either don't care, don't know, or are indifferent to america. And some of the
    middle classes -what's left of them-and other classes, may actually be quite fond
    of parts of American culture: music, literature, films etc [small aside: yesterday
    a matric-educated, Punjabi-speaking cleaner asked me to get him some Jazzy B chains!]  But
    in terms of political views I think it's a lot more than the english-speaking
    middle classes who think America is a bit delusional (to put it politely)...and
    that's putting to one side the American-Zionist-Hindu- conspiray theories!  no
    \"source\", i'm afraid. Just a gut feeling that we're being drawn into an escalation
    of violence and uncertainty because of america's muddled thinking.   as
    to your other point, I still think that pakistan's support was for groups that
    did not have an \"internationalist\" or globalist agenda. They were opposed either
    to occupation: by  infidel Russia or infidel India. Anti-american or anti-western,
    with global pretensions? Not so sure.   agree with ray, it's in pakistan's
    own interest to crack down (and it's a pity the ISI couldn't see that earlier),
    but maybe  it would be made easier by the withdrawal of american troops from afghanistan?
    anyway, that's my two cents."

    WILL withdraw or drawdown substantially in a few years, they have little interest

    The terrorists being trained were for local use (somehow you do not define Russia,
    Iran and India as \"international\").  2. They were a fringe phenomenon. 3.
    Their actions have been made worse by American intervention.   I submit
    that alternatives exist to this framework: 1. The terrorists being trained
    were NOT a fringe phenomenon. What is your theory about how half a million young
    men were to be used? Where exactly would they have gone to fight? What was their
    aim? What was the ENDGAME of this terrorist training program, in your view? and
    how would that endgame have remained \"local\"? 2. While the US does not care
    as much about India or Russia as it does about Americans, it is wrong to think
    that it has no interest in a war involving India, Pakistan, Russia, Iran and possibly
    China. 3. If there was no war in 2000, why would there be war later? Well,
    first of all, there was a small scale war on in Kashmir, in Afghanistan, in Chechnya,
    even in central asia. What is your reason for believing that it could never escalate? 4.
    American intervention has actually damped down the wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir,
    but it has moved the war into Pakistan. True. But what was the alternative? As
    a Pakistani, you may feel aggrieved that you are being forced to fight terrorists
    in your own country when your plan was to use them locally (NOT internationally,
    as you say, but \"locally\" in Russia and India and Iran(you dont mention Iran,
    but ask some Iranians and your opinion may change). but honestly, can you think
    of a good argument why NON-Pakistanis should prefer to fight these terrorists
    in their own country instead of going after the heads of the network in Pakistan?"

    in this way for a long time.  of course, you may be right, i don't know. but i'd

    Khalidi here, but I took that to mean and describe the rationale from the viewpoint
    of the Pakistani state that sponsored such groups during that period in the past,
    not the author's own personal current views. Within that security mindset which
    has influenced the external outlook and policy of the Pakistani military, maintaining
    a friendly regime in Afghanistan and laying claim to Kashmir all fall in line
    with the stated aim of attempting to meet or achieve some sort of rough parity
    with India (through the notorious 'strategic depth' doctrine). Now one can argue
    as to the merits of this policy and its benefits vs. costs for Pakistanis as well
    as other South Asian actors; but that is different from saying that there is some
    'globalist' agenda at play. The aims here, if anything, are very regional. Of
    course, mobilising networks of trans-national irregular fighters has global consequences
    but these were not a foreseen or desired outcome by Pakistani - or indeed US policymakers
    who did so at the time - blowback etc.etc. I believe this is the point.  <i>Apparently
    violations of sovereignty and strikes against civilians are bad only in selected
    cases.</i>  I think there is a difference between 'bad' in terms of morality
    and 'bad' in terms of political and strategic outcomes. We can all agree that
    in moral terms such actions are bad; however, since states are not moral actors
    and since all states in the region have engaged in these actions, we are looking
    at the political and strategic outcomes of such actions. Sometimes, unpalatable
    though it is, actions which are morally 'bad' can have outcomes which from the
    point of view of some states is regarded as politically beneficial. I actually
    don't think this is the case here or generally as a rule; but this depends on
    how one defines issues such as the 'national interest' etc. Which is what is being
    discussed here, rather than the morality of such policies per se - I would hope
    that the latter should be pretty clear."

  content: "Ajit, hello. I thought it goes without saying that terrorist activities
    in India or anywhere else supported by elements in Pakistan are wrong, morally
    bad. And if India's doing the same that obviously applies to them as well. For
    heaven's sake...  But I think it's correct, legally speaking, to say that
    Kashmir is still a  disputed territory, no? And there can surely still be legitimate
    resistance to occupation /oppression ?  I mean, what are we saying here: that
    the 70-80,000 people killed in Kashmir have all been terrorists? One might as
    well say that all of the Palestinian violence is terrorism. I think that masks
    the distinction between the illegitimate/immoral violence carried out by these
    groups and the legitimate (I hesitate to call it 'moral') on the other; and it
    deflects from the question of state violence (wasn't the word 'terror' first used
    in conjunction with state violence (Burleigh))?  As I've said earlier, I
    think the extremists are a curse. Not only has the strategy of supporting them
    proved to be disastrous, it was wrong (in my opinion) in the first place to support
    groups whose outlook is so fundamentally backward and repugnant. All I'm saying
    is that I doubt whether they were motivated by some over-arching notion of establishing
    the caliphate  or were primarily driven by an anti-western, anti-American agenda.
    Certainly it would be hard to imagine their American/Saudi/ISI backers having
    that as an 'endgame' (assuming that they even thought beyond immediate concerns)
    and it is equally hard to imagine the foot-soldiers not being primarily motivated
    by the desire to drive the infidel out (perhaps I should say 'infidel' to avoid
    being noted!)  Of course, they may have merged with Arab and Uzbeki fanatics
    and be part of some global network. Who can say?. My only point was to question
    whether from the outset these groups were supported for an \"internationalist\"
    -which I read as globalist-agenda."

  content: "Khalid,  your statement \"endgame? don't know..like
    beckett's, maybe it was meant to be just a slow running down,
    a depletion.\" is not clear to me. Are you implying that the project of training
    half a million jihadis (a number I got from Arif Jamal's book, but which may or
    may not be correct) was some kind of clever way of depleting the jihadist virus? I
    will tell you what I think. I think the scale of the enterprise is simply not
    known to most English speaking Pakistanis since they were out of the loop on this
    one (except the hamid gul types who were part of the project).   Most educated
    Pakistanis think there were some \"Kashmiri freedom fighters\" being helped out
    in some way, but everyone does that sort of thing and Kashmir is a just cause
    and India is interfering in Balochistan, so nothing to get too excited about.
    In actual fact, the scale of the jihadi effort was extremely impressive. There
    were dozens of training camps all over Kohistan/mansehra/AJK and in the tribal
    areas. Recruitment was carried out at hundreds of madressas. Thousands of young
    men went through these camps. Many of them came back to their villages and became
    men of importance. I dont know if you have had a chance to see Ajmal Kasab's first
    videotaped interrogation in which he mentions how his dad \"sold\" him to the
    jihadis because then he too would have nice clothes and be treated with respect.
    All over the country, these organizations gave a new life to people whom the existing
    unjust system provides nothing but humiliation. But this was no proletarian struggle.
    They learned nothing about expropriating the capitalists or changing the system
    in ways that leftists would find recognizable. They joined Allah's army and while
    some of them took advantage of that to become local gangsters, others were waiting
    for orders to go on the next mission...not just to India, but also for the day
    when Pakistan itself would be purified.  Dont believe me? ask them. They are
    very happy to talk (or were until last year..now,  there is likely to be some
    reticence, but if they trust you, they will be happy to relate their pure ambitions). btw,
    if you dig around, you will find people who got things done via these jihadis.
    Very basic things, like getting a transfer cancelled or a bill paid. This phenomenon
    is natural, but again, its not one that just stops at this point. This was a very
    large project, it was never meant to just use these people as bargaining chips
    with India. Or rather, it was intended that way by morons like Musharraf, but
    not by true believers like Mahmud and Hamid Gul. And the true believers were more
    realistic than the morons. Let me ask you this; suppose these were all \"local\".
    What was the purpose of training them? To send them to Kashmir? and then what
    happens? As you may remember, India did not exactly roll over and play dead at
    Kargil. If more of these people were sent, how would that have forced India to
    accept defeat? what if India decided to \"do more\"? Why are you so sure that
    India (unlike most countries) would never take action against Pakistan even if
    thousands of more jihadis were launched against them?  And again, if they were
    not being launched against India, what was the purpose of training them? And remember,
    not only was this vast enterprise in motion, anyone talking too much about it
    in English could have his car burned by the ISI in broad daylight (amir mir).
    Everyone knew these were protected people. Ask the police. they can tell you many
    stories of jihadis they could not investigate or had to let go because \"hasaas
    idara\" white shalwar kameez chaps showed up. Are you aware of the anti-shia
    activities of many of these groups? what was to be the endgame of that particular
    trend? Was it also supposed to just drift away or could it have grown worse if
    9-11 had not disrupted things? My point, Khalid sahib, is that this was not
    a project that was compatible with peaceful coexistence at home or abroad. 9-11
    invited America into the business prematurely, but otherwise too this would have
    led to war. In afghanistan, the next step was to increase Islamist rebellions
    in the central asian dictatorships. China would have come into the picture because
    ETIM supporters were also being sheltered and trained by some of these networks.
    Iran was the main supporter of the Northern alliance and would have been involved
    in this war irrespective of 9-11. India would have widened the war at some point,
    OR the Musharraf type morons would have made a good bargain with India and then
    discovered they have to deal with these thousands of jihadis who refuse to be
    demobilized. I cannot prove that all this would have happened. Who can? But a
    close examination of the scale of this project leaves me in no doubt. This was
    a war that was bound to come. The only difference would have been when and where. I
    urge you see the dispatches documentary on Mumbai, or the HBO documentary. You
    will understand where the people who calmly walked into a mosque and shot up children
    and old people were coming from. This was going to come home to roost at some
    point. America just brought the game home sooner than the hasaas idara xpected..."

    than 170 civilians and 0 &ldquo;intended targets&rdquo;.
    I see you protesting against the former but appealing to some relativistic notions
    of states, effectiveness and morality in the other case.</i>   10 civilians
    the is minimum figure here, the actual figure could be much higher; but the point
    isn't the morality of it, since killing civilians isn't moral, whether you kill
    them in the tens or the hundreds; arguing that we could have always killed more
    civilians and should be praised for our restraint in killing only some is as the
    comedian Alexi Sayle would say the morality of the psychopath - of course we could
    always be more destructive if we wished, but this is hardly any reason for a pat
    on the back or smug self-congratulation. But this is besides the point, some of
    your language and adjectives have been incorrect and/or misleading; I haven't
    anywhere 'protested' against drone attacks as you claim, I just pointed out that
    their success rate is low and the consequent loss of civilian casualties high
    - targeted accuracy is meant to be one of the major benefits of using drones,
    it isn't meant to be a hit and miss method. We are being incessantly told by many
    American commanders from McChrystal downwards that securing the consent of the
    local population is the only way to decisively defeat the Taliban; the old 'hearts
    and minds' approach much talked about since Vietnam, I remain sceptical as to
    whether killing 10 civilians for every insurgent is going to win you a lot of
    hearts or minds. If it was a case of targeting a few or a handful of leaders,
    I could understand the political and the tactical logic of it, but several years
    on the attacks are continuing and there talk of <b>expanding</b> their usage to
    major urban areas. I question the <b>political and the strategic</b> effectiveness
    of doing so. I never said anything about the morality of it, because I take it
    sort of given that killing Pakistani civilians isn't moral. Feel free to disagree
    if you have some sort of sliding scale where these actions are somehow less moral
    than others. But my point is that from the stated aims of US policy - ie defeating
    the Taliban and eliminating terrorist networks, I don't think this action will
    be particularly effective or wise, since it will not deal an effective surgical
    strike (given loss rates and the fact that drone attacks have continued and indeed
    escalated without delivering a decisive blow) but will have a large political
    cost in terms of increasing support for these groups on the ground and provoking
    backlash.  Secondly, I just want to point out I am unsure as to what 'other
    case' you claim to be talking about. Killing civilians and using terrorism is
    'bad' both morally and politically in my eyes but they are two separate discussions.
    I think few would disagree on the former, certainly not me, and your implication
    that I would do so, is false. If you want to somehow argue that you feel such
    deaths more than I do or weep more copiously over them, feel free to do so. But
    don't suggest or imply that I somehow think that it isn't wrong, because I do
    and so would almost all people, at least in this discussion here. Either way,
    this is a simple point and needs only to be made once; there isn't much room for
    discussion, either you agree/think this way or you don't. Discussions of political
    effectiveness and strategy are separate because as I said we are talking about
    state actors and morality is not a prime concern or motivation for them; generally
    speaking they will respond only to how effective their policies are from a political
    ans strategic point of view, talking about morality, in my experience has little
    or no effect on them, hence my setting aside. I hope this makes my position clear."

    that sense a depletion). obtuse, i know!  I take on board your point, but
    it's hardly an argument to say that \"others were waiting to go on...\" I mean,
    that's based on what? an hbo documentary and an interview with kasab? I'm not
    trying to be sarky , or anyhting, but could you provide some sort of academic
    references that that was the major objective of the jihadis (I'm assuming you're
    not talking about the jihadis when they were backed by america, the saudis and
    the isi, right?,..then they were good jihadis, i presume)  yes, i agree
    with you omar, it wasn't a project that was compatibile with peace. I think i

    mean, haven't the taleban said that they would defend pakistan against an american

    was bound to backfire eventually. But the nature and extent of it is not something
    i think one can easily speculate on. in any case, my only point was that i think
    it would be/will be more manageable if the americans weren't in afghansistan or
    at least playing some other role.  \"calmly walked...\"  well, yes,
    that's atrocious, of course.  but i'm sorry, i don't see the people who coldly
    bomb from the skies on a false pretext as much better. no mournful flutes playing

    You seem to think that one crime (aerial bombing) justifies another. I think they
    are not even in the same discussion. Nations fight, air forces bomb. That is all
    very bad, but that is where the world is. Thanks to real efforts by heroic figures,
    that is not where it will stay (and it HAS moved from where it used to be....it
    was perfectly OK for the prophets of the old testament to order the killing of
    babies , it was routine for Arabs and Turks and Europeans to massacre by the thousands
    in the middle ages, it was OK for all countries to indiscriminately bomb civilians
    in world war two, but its no longer OK...now, it has to be hidden or its not even
    the primary intention and civilian casualties really ARE collateral damage). But
    the terrorists are NOT a step forward. they are a step backward.  They really
    ARE worse than the pilot who bombs from the air. Got to run, but I have some arguments
    about this and will be sure to carry on.  Btw, what do you think of the terrorists
    who TARGETED women and children (no military target in sight) in Moon Market Lahore
    today? Do you think they are on par with the US air force? or even better? I
    will tell you what I think> I think the US air force is positively saintly compared

    some human qualities by showing sympathy for the victims of the people in my city
    instead of trying to score points. Bad form, my dear. \"Btw\" ? What the f***
    is that?...hearts and minds, hearts and minds, said the great natural philosopher.  Now,
    I realise that as an American English may not be your first language, but really,
    you should be a bit more careful when you use words like \"justify\". If you're
    trying to needle me, please don't, it's very childish and a waste of time.  To
    your more substantive points:  Firstly, I don't think it was\"okay\" and
    I don't think all people then thought it was okay. The doctrine of 'just war'
    may or may not have been very well developed but I don't think the 'middle ages',
    as they're contemptuously called, were devoid of a sense of moral constraints
    on political and economic behaviour (why else would Machiavelli have caused such
    a stir?)  Secondly, you've got to be joking! On the back of what Hobsbawm
    called the bloodiest century on record, after the Trenches, the Gulags, the Bomb,
    Auschwitz, I don't think one can seriously maintain that there's been much 'movement'
    (at least not in a positive direction). And I think ti's worth recalling that
    most of the violence of that century (whether it's been Vietnam, Sudan, Bosnia,
    Iraq, or India-Pakistan) has been carried out by nation states. I think Foucault
    was right here when he called Nazism 'state racism'.   And such violence
    is also considered \"okay\" , even pre-emptive violence is justified. And the
    boundaries of what is considered to be torture are being re-thought. That's where
    we are, my friend!   I don't think anyone is a hero just because they have
    a feather in their cap and wear a uniform (just as they're not just because they
    wear a beard and call themselves muslims). But yeah, each to their own, I guess.  \"saintly\"?
    Really? Do you think the hundreds of thousands of people who have died in Iraq
    \ have been \"worth it\" (to paraphrase Madeleine Albright)? And the firebombing
    of Tokyo (do read Berger's intriguing piece in the Guardian on this). And didn't
    the American commander say that all Japanese were animals or barbarians (not the
    army, mind you, but *all* of them?..see Rawls' Law of Peoples)  No, Omar,
    after a century of slavery and a century of segregation, after the destruction
    of the native peoples, I don't think America is very saintly."

    my posts as much as you want. My point, bhaijan, is much simpler. Let us assume
    that the US is evil incarnate. And we dont even have to assume that they are ham-handed
    and crude because we probably already agree on that one. The point is, what would
    be the best way to deal with this situation? I think it would be better to cooperate
    with the US against the jihadis and try to safeguard more basic things (like water
    rights, boundary disputes, issues of sovereignity) instead of playing games with
    them and trying to preserve good taliban and good jihadis for future use.  That
    only pushes them to use more underhand means of their own. And their means (even
    after relative decline) greatly exceed our own.  Khalid, my point about the
    middle ages was also misinterpreted. I made no claim that they were universally
    bad and the last century was universally good. I did say that public morality
    has shifted a little, enough so that even imperialist invaders have to pretend
    to be doing something else and public torture is not advertised and mass killings
    are not boasted of. To me, that is a change, even if a small one. I am well aware
    that to many other people (especially in academia) it is not a change at all.

    to be a reference to the general shift on the discourse of what is acceptable
    in waging war; most of the contributions here have been made by civilians, NGOs
    and popular pressure from below as we can see through things like the Geneva Conventions,
    Red Cross, UN conventions on genocide, child soldiers etc. I don't think many
    of them have been pushed for by states or by soldiers. As we can see from Cheney's
    so-called attempt to 'go to the dark side' most states have been willing to circumvent
    these in the name of national security; without much success it has to be said
    imo. There is a definitely a move forward in what is deemed acceptable, especially
    in many parts of the more 'developed' countries; though some worrying trends remain
    (support for torture seems quite high to me for example in places like the US)
    the big issue is that there isn't a realisation that if you take these things
    seriously, have to be uniformly and consistently applied; you can't exclude your
    own forces or the forces of those you support from them and you can stop these
    measures when it is inconvenient to do so. They are kind of indivisible that way,
    either they are taken seriously and properly applied with discrimination otherwise
    it is difficult to avoid the charge of hyporcrisy."

    strongly about. When it comes to helping people to resist Communist pressures
    of all sorts&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether you call them aggression or whatever you
    call them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it has been my conviction for many years that no
    assistance of this sort can be effective unless the people themselves have a very
    high degree of determination and a willingness to help themselves. The moment
    they begin to place the bulk of the burden on us, I think the whole situation
    is lost. So strongly do I feel about this that I have often said publicly that
    the only people worth helping in this world are the people who say, &ldquo;We
    propose to survive whether you help us or not, and just because you don't
    help us doesn't mean we are going to go under. It means that
    we are going to fight to the last ditch anyway but it may be a little easier if
    you help us.&rdquo;  Now, the people who take that standpoint,
    there is something you can latch onto. But I am extremely suspicious every time
    I hear it said that &ldquo;If you Americans don't
    give us more than you have given us or if you slacken your efforts on our behalf,
    we will become fainthearted, and then what will become of you?&rdquo;
    And I think there is only one answer to this, and that is, &ldquo;Whatever
    becomes of us will not be as bad as what becomes of you yourselves if you become
    fainthearted.&rdquo;  In other words, I do not believe in the
    possibility of helping people when it comes to problems that are partly problems
    of their internal political life, unless they themselves have a very high degree
    of determination and of internal self-discipline; and if things have deteriorated
    so far in these countries that they can't mobilize this sort
    of public morale and determination, I don't think any foreign
    force can put it into them. I think, then, the entry of a foreign force into the
    situation confuses it and creates new confusing elements which make it all the
    more difficult, and I think this is what has happened inVietnam, and I have seen
    it happen in other situations in history.\"  http://www.antiwar.com/blog/2009/12/09/george-f-kennan-on-the-escalation-in-afghanistan/"

    up of events to that war. Regarding Kashmir, the Pakistani army had been trying
    to foment an uprising there for decades; a large of the 1965 war was based on
    the erroneous calculation that the Valley would rise up against India. One needs
    to ask why this policy failed for decades, only to become successful in the late
    80s."

    would like Pakistan to do. He asked for one thing. He wanted Pakistan to attack
    Haqqani in North Waziristan; saying that ISAF/ANSF will be able to finish them
    off west of the Durand Line if the Pakistanis do their part in the East. McChrystal
    repeated a list of terrorist groups linked to Haqqani, including Haqqani's close
    ties to Tehrik-i-Taliban.  I wonder if Pakistanis are open to conducting
    such an attack. If Pakistan does it (and 203rd ANA Corps, Khost and Paktya ANP,
    and ISAF RC-East push from the East); what would happen? How would your  passage,

    years, it would be an odd arguement to say that they suddenly became so effective

    than a decade previously. In anycase, Kashmir is still far from situation it was

  content: "Akbar, still not sure what you are implying. What conflicts are taking
    place? Perhaps in order of importance: 1) Pashtun civil war on both sides of
    the Durand Line 2) Pakistani Civil war 3) War between Taliban (and her allies)
    and GIRoA/ANSF/ISAF 4) Proxy war between Taliban (and her allies) and Russia/Iran/Shiites/India  Many
    Pashtun tribes are highly committed both to fight for the Taliban and to fight
    against the Taliban. That is why there is a Pashtun civil war in the first place.  The
    ANA has a high degree of esprit de corps. Afghans volunteer to fight in the ANA
    in large numbers, including Kabul, Northern and Eastern Pasthuns (ANA is about
    42% Pashtun and gets approximately 5,000 volunteers a month.) Khost (adjacent
    to Haqqani's Northern Waziristan stronghold) has arguably the best ANA and ANP
    in all of Afghanistan. The population is anti Taliban and volunteer for the ANA
    and ANP. The primary adversary they fight is Haqqani (Mullah Omar's Quetta Shura
    Taliban isn't a large factor in Khost) and Haqqani's allies (TTP, LeT, Jaish e
    Mohammed, LeJ, Sipah e Sahaba, two Uzbek groups . . . etc.)  On the other
    hand many Pashtun tribes on both sides of the Durand line are loyal to Haqqani
    and his TTP allies; and are willing to fight to the death for Haqqani. Haqqani's
    fighters are among the best quality and best motivated on either side of the Durand
    line.  The ANSF and Haqqani are bleeding each other in Khost . This isn't
    good for the rest of Afghanistan because McChrystal, and the ANSF leaders would
    like to redeploy quality ANSF form Khost to other Afghan provinces where they
    are badly needed.  I am not sure what the relevance of your passage is to
    the situation in Waziristan and the Khost Bowl. The many parties fighting each
    other \"themselves have a very high degree of determination and of internal self-discipline.\"  Similarly
    in many parts of Pakistan, many Pashtun Tribes are determined to help the Pakistani
    Army defeat the Taliban. On the other hand, many other Pashtun tribes on both
    sides of the Durand line are determined to fight for the Taliban.  Perhaps
    you could identify specific districts and provinces where your quote applies.
    I don't think it applies to either the Pakistani or Afghan armies or their war
    as a whole.  This said, it might be that certain parts of Southern Afghanistan,
    such as perhaps certain pockets in Kandahar and Helmand really do support the
    Taliban against the GiRoA/ANSF/ISAF. It looks like we will find out over the next
    few months; since that is where most of the Obama surge is going.  The ANA
    are also sending 16 combat companies (4 combat battalions worth; although they
    will probably attach to existing battalion HQs)  by early winter to join the fight
    in Helmand. The ANA will almost certainly send substantial reinforcements to Kandahar
    over the next six months as well.  Will the ANA and ANP and their GIRoA
    be seen as liberators, or as a hostile occupation force (backed by Uzbeks, Shiites,
    Iranians, Tajiks, Westerners, Jews, Indians, Russians) in the areas that the Taliban
    are expelled from?  I think the ANA will be well received in most of Kandahar
    and Helmand; unfortunately the ANP may not be."

    alternatives and how to get there, but meanwhile the situation in Pakistan is
    really simpler: Pakistan is in no position to play regional power, sending proxies
    to attack neighbouring countries and playing games with bigger powers on whom
    it depends for daily cash infusions. Its "long war" may end in insolvency long
    before the US reaches that point....'

  content: "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/wo...a/02pstan.html  I wrote this
    note on my group in response to the above news. comments welcome. Another terrible
    bombing, this time in Lakki Marwat. It seems the suicidal maniac was headed for
    a peace committee meeting but could not get there due to heavy security, so he
    hit the wall of a playground and went to meet the 72 virgins short of his final
    target. Sadly, there was a volleyball game going on in the playground and there
    were a lot of spectators. TV is saying 70 or more are dead and the death toll
    could rise. Since this particular tragedy has struck poor pathans in a small
    town, its not going to register for too long on the minds of the Pakistani elite,
    who will no doubt be back to discussing blackwater safehouses within two days
    max. But while some vague sense of outrage and disorientation still exists, I
    am going to throw out some random thoughts and make some predictions...the purpose
    is to invite all of you to make some predictions of your own. Predictions are
    what distinguish science from fantasy. Social change is too complex to be modeled
    like the physical sciences (at least at this point) but still, unless we can make
    a prediction, our models are worthless...so here goes. 1. I think the neo-wahabi
    paradigm which lies at the heart of the jihadi operation in Pakistan (the network
    obviously extends into Afghanistan and other places and crucial sources lie in
    Saudi Arabia, but the largest physical node is in Pakistan) is not compatible
    with \"normal\" existence in the globalized world and its going to be slowly and
    painfully pushed further and further away from the mainstream. This process of
    separating it from its \"mainstream\" supporters like the high command of the
    Pak army is going to accelerate. Friends who believe the army is irreversibly
    pro-jihadi are not correct. The army WAS pro-jihadi and is still terribly confused
    about whether they can save \"good jihadis\" for future use against India , but
    they will be pushed to give them up by circumstances. The army and the jihadis
    will stand against each other one day. GHQ may not know it, but one day it will
    even fight against old friends like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. Maybe not in
    weeks or months, but certainly in years. 2. Recurrent waves of anti-Americanism
    and \"paknationalism\" will confuse the process. Old Nationalists will struggle
    with their 60 years worth of anti-indian training with the need to make an accomodation
    not just with the Indian state but with our own Indian heritage.Old leftists will
    struggle to align their anti-imperialist models and their issues with capitalism
    with the need to cooperate with the imperial war machine.Swarms of ex-foreign
    secretaries and retired generals will display their utter confusion on TV for
    many months to come. But the fact is, the jihadi paradigm is retrogressive, indiscriminately
    violent, and unable to deliver relief from ANY of the multiple real grievances
    and conflicts that various classes and groups have against others all over the
    world. All this sound and fury will blow over and most of these people will end
    up compromising deeply held beliefs to deal with this menace. Being human, they
    will do so without necessarily admitting it even to themselves, but in whatever
    messy form, they will do it.  3. Many respected commentators will take a
    while to overcome their own habits of automatic self-censorship. Lesser known
    commentators will push the envelope first and better known ones will step forward
    more aggressively only after they realize that A, B or C can actually be said
    without the heavens falling. Some friends will be surprised at how dramatically
    the tone will shift from hunting for Jews and Hindus under every bed to openly
    identifying the jihadis AND their fellow travellers as a terrorist menace that
    will have to be dealt with before we can come back to the arguments about imperialism
    and \"the metropolitan XYZ\"...in other words, before we can become just another
    \"normal country\", stuggling with all the issues raised by the existence of 7
    billion unequally placed humans on one planet..."

    the attacks. What he points out is a lack of debate about what is motivating the
    fanaticism of these individuals and I quote  <i>So, Washington's sanitized
    discussion about motives for terrorism seems more intended for the U.S. domestic
    audience than the Muslim world.  After all, people in the Middle East already
    know how Palestinians have been mistreated for decades; how Washington has propped
    up Arab dictatorships; how Muslims have been locked away at Guantanamo without
    charges; how the U.S. military has killed civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere;
    how U.S. mercenaries have escaped punishment for slaughtering innocents.  The
    purpose of U.S. \"public diplomacy\" appears more designed to shield Americans
    from this unpleasant reality, offering instead feel-good palliatives about the
    beneficence of U.S. actions. Most American journalists and politicians go along
    with the charade out of fear that otherwise they would be accused of lacking patriotism
    or sympathizing with \"the enemy.\"  Commentators who are neither na&Atilde;&macr;ve
    nor afraid are simply shut out of the Fawning Corporate Media (FCM). Salon.com's
    Glen Greenwald, for example, has complained loudly about \"how our blind, endless
    enabling of Israeli actions fuels terrorism directed at the U.S.,\" and how it
    is taboo to point this out.</i>  And McGovern a decades long retired CIA
    Analyst is not alone  in his eagerness to debate the motivation of these individuals.
    Here is Stephen Walt raising the same question.  <i>My point is not to rehash
    the whole debate over the invasion of Iraq (although to be honest, I don't think
    there's much debate to be had over the folly of that particular decision). My
    point is simply to reiterate that any serious effort to deal with our terrorism
    problem has to be multi-faceted, and has to include explicit consideration of
    the things we do that may encourage violent, anti-American movements. Only a complete
    head-in-the-sand approach to the issue would deny the connection between various
    aspects of U.S. foreign and military policy (military interventions, targeted
    assassinations, unconditional support for Israel, cozy relations with Arab dictatorships,
    etc.) and the fact that groups like al Qaeda keep finding people like al-Balawi
    to recruit to their cause.  </i>  http://walt.foreignpolicy.com  Juan
    Cole also chimes in on the same theme as above  <i>But from a social science,
    explanatory point of view, what we have to remember is that there can be a handful
    of al-Balawis, or there can be thousands or hundreds of thousands. It depends
    on how many Abu Ghraibs, Fallujahs, Lebanons and Gazas the United States initiates
    or supports to the hilt. Unjust wars and occupations radicalize people. The American

    make profits for the military-industrial complex, and the resulting terrorism
    terrifies the clueless US public and helps hawks win elections, allowing them
    to pursue further wars.</i>  So the point is not to justify or rationalize
    \ the violence that \"Muslims\" or individuals with Muslim names want to visit
    on \"West\", but to discuss what motivates them, right now the competing theories
    are  Muslims/Islamists/Islamicates are inherently deranged and violent and
    looking for rvenge  Vs they are freedom fighters and heros trying to reverse the
    Western oppresion and avenge the honnor of Ummah. To me None of these narrative
    is whole truth or even closer to truth. And that is why opening up the debate
    on their motivation  is not equivallent to condoning what is being done. Now
    as for you suggestion to drop word \"Muslim\" from the discourse, it will be th
    ultimate sanitizer, but does it help solve any conflict.  \" The world would
    be a scarier place than it is if followers of other religions thought in this
    way\"  Again probably unwittingly you are implying that more than 1 billion
    Muslims all are thinking  like underwear bomber, and that is precisely why thoughtful
    people like McGovern  want this discussion so earnestly."

    to murder and wanton slaughter of innocents... They attract individuals like Mr.

    of religious sort of drive. Unfortunately, al Qaeda has perverted Islam, and has

    an al Qaeda organization that used the banner of religion in a very perverse and
    corrupt way.\"  Thomas: \"Why?\"  Brennan: \"I think this is a - long
    issue, but al Qaeda is just determined to carry out attacks here against the homeland.\"  Thomas:
    \"But you haven't explained why.\"  Neither did President Obama, nor anyone
    else in the U.S. political/media hierarchy. All the American public gets is the
    boilerplate about how evil al Qaeda continues to pervert a religion and entice
    and exploit impressionable young men.  There is almost no discussion about
    why so many people in the Muslim world object to U.S. policies so strongly that
    they are inclined to resist violently and even resort to suicide attacks.  Obama's
    Non-Answer  I had been hoping Obama would say something intelligent about
    what drove Abdulmutallab to do what he did, but the President limited himself
    to a few vacuous comments before sending in the clowns. This is what he said before
    he walked away from the podium:  \"It is clear that al Qaeda increasingly
    seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations ... to do their
    bidding. ... And that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the
    world that al Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death
    ... while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress. ...
    That's the vision that is far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists.\"  But
    why it is so hard for Muslims to \"get\" that message? Why can't they end their
    preoccupation with dodging U.S. missiles in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and
    Gaza long enough to reflect on how we are only trying to save them from terrorists
    while simultaneously demonstrating our commitment to \"justice and progress\"?  Does
    a smart fellow like Obama expect us to believe that all we need to do is \"communicate
    clearly to Muslims\" that it is al Qaeda, not the U.S. and its allies, that brings
    \"misery and death\"? Does any informed person not know that the unprovoked U.S.-led
    invasion of Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and displaced 4.5 million
    from their homes? How is that for \"misery and death\"?  Rather than a failure
    to communicate, U.S. officials are trying to rewrite recent history, which seems
    to be much easier to accomplish with the Washington press corps and large segments
    of the American population than with the Muslim world.  But why isn't there
    a frank discussion by America's leaders and media about the real motivation of
    Muslim anger toward the United States? Why was Helen Thomas the only journalist
    to raise the touchy but central question of motive? </i>  Now your postiion
    to me crystalizes as  follows,  we drop the word \"Muslim \"  from the discourse
    and get busy confronting the fanatics without wasting time in understanding their
    logic or illogic ,motivation or lack of motivation etc, .  I respect your
    opinion but disagree that it is solution to anything and there is overwhelming
    evidence for that, as we say in urdu 'Dard bahrta gia joon  joon dawa kee'."

<p>We will support democracy. We supported the "flawed" election of Karzai. That, unfortunately, is not "the past". We supported Pervez Musharraf. He doesn't want to be "the past". And neither does "President Zardari" - who was bequeathed both a political party and a nation by a woman who last won an election in 1993 but was still the only possible future Pakistan was deemed to have. Sadly, she is also "the past". </p>
<p>Should I have been heartened, at least, by his "concerns about our approach." Yes, there are some concerns. In Islamabad. In Kabul. Maybe even is Khost and Karachi. Or in Kandahar and Lahore. We weren't told but maybe those concerns were heard in the "review process". I am sure that the easy traffic of weapons and people across borders, the legitimate demands of dis-enfranchised in Swat or Baluchistan, the fear of every-day life in Lahore or Karachi were all heard and discussed. Could it be that this "let's send some more troops and help train some other more troops" strategy was developed with the political and civil leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan at the table with the Iranian, Indian, and Chinese officials to address inter and intra-regional tactics? Maybe hidden in the fine print are new means of communication, new definitions of strategic aims and missions and a much more harmonized action plan? It certainly never was in "the past". </p>
<p>We have to "go forward", "go forward", while "going forward", "going forward" and then "move forward" while "moving forward". And Afghanistan? It has "moved backwards". Movement is key in a stateless country where the only anchored reference remains Alexander the Great. We will move forward. If it comes that these (safe?) havens also move, we will already be ahead of them. Or behind.</p>
<p>Here we go 'round the mulberry bush.</p>
