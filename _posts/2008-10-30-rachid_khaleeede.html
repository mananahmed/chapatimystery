  content: "I was going to write about this but you and Professor Cole have said it
    better than I could. Three thoughts or observations, from the brief clip I saw
    on CNN last night of Sarah Palin \r\n\r\na) She pronounced his name \"KHA-LAA-DEE\".\r\n\r\nb)
    The crowd appears to have started booing when she referred to him as a Palestinian.
    The boos got louder as she suggested the 'terrorist' link of course. Professor
    Cole is absolutely right. Khalidi's only crime is that he is a Palestinian.\r\n\r\nc)
    Some of the booing may have had to do with the fact of his being a 'professor'.

  content: "Hitchens has called McCain's attack on Rashidi \"appalling:\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2203619/\r\n\r\n\"If
    Rashid chooses to state that he doesn't care to be evicted from his ancestral
    home in order to make way for some settler from Brooklyn who claims to have God
    on his side, I think he has a perfect right to say so. I would go further and
    say that if Barack Obama was looking for a Palestinian friend, he could not have
    chosen any better. But perhaps John McCain has decided that he doesn't need any
    Palestinian friends and neither do we. Perhaps he thinks it's all right to refer
    to refugees and victims of occupation, who have been promised self-determination
    and statehood at the podium of the United Nations and the U.S. Congress by George
    Bush and Condoleezza Rice, as if they were Hitlerites. How shameful. How disgusting.
    How ignorant.\""

<p>[caption id="attachment_2001" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Actual Professors in Hyde Park"]<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dsc00012.jpg"><img src="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dsc00012.jpg" alt="Actual Professors in Hyde Park" title="Actual Professors in Hyde Park" width="500" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-2001" /></a>[/caption] Last night, from Sarah Palin, Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow (&#9829;!) and Jon Stewart, I heard about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WATyqhWgYZk">"yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with Barack Obama going back several years"</a>, "Rashid Khalidi". It is a startling realization; one that has caused me to reassess my impression, and my feelings for Hyde Park. Some of you may not know that Hyde Park has lots of "professors and such". And now, with this bombshell, people are going to look at these innocent workers with suspicion. It cannot be. Let me be the first to defend the Hyde Park Professors as god-fearing, church-going, freedom-loving true-blood Americans who live in the Real America &#169;. These are not the people we need to fear.</p>
<p>Now, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7NzAbvMfo">Khaleeede</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mixJBRDlPM">guy</a>. I have, I am forced to admit, taken classes with him. He led me to believe that he was just some generous-hearted, razor-sharp intelligent, thoughtful, New Yorker who cared deeply about his scholarship as well as his students. I even held him to be a "role-model"; someone to emulate. I was obviously brain-washed. </p>
<p>I will, certainly, undergo the hundreds of hours of "Re-education" that is needed. And I will do it with a smile.</p>
<p>Others, like Juan Cole, can spin a <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/10/mccain-racism-hypocrisy-on-khalidi.html">masterful defense</a> of the "idiotic wind" that went through my neighborhood. I will just focus on cleaning up the name of these fair grounds.  </p>
<p>PS: You can also see <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/10/hbc-90003779">Scott Horton</a> and <a href="http://icga.blogspot.com/2008/10/rubin-my-friend-neo-nazi.html">Barney Rubin</a>'s defense of Hyde Park. </p>
<p>PPS: By default, anything Daniel Pipes says is bullshit, but, um, here: <a href="http://blogs.jta.org/politics/2008/10/30/2643/khalidi-and-the-plo/">Khalidi and the PLO</a>, if you must.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Sadly, the Obama campaign can only manage a <a href="http://fightthesmears.com/articles/24/KhalidiSmear">how pro-Israel we is</a> defense, instead of pointing out the racism of McCain's attack. </p>
