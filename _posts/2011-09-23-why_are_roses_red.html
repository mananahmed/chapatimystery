<p>When ships are launched, they pour water or more bubbly stuff to ask the gods to bless it. When Books are launched, the gods are less likely to be pleased if water is poured on it. </p>
<p>On Monday, Aug 26th, at 7pm, we will be <a href="http://aaww.org/#sept26">launching</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Wild-Frontiers-Are-Imagination/dp/1935982060/">Where The Wild Frontiers Are</a></em> at The Asian American Writers' Workshop in New York with Amitava Kumar and Vijay Prashad. </p>
<p>It would please me immensely to have you attend. Ask inappropriate questions. Please. (From AK and VP, of course)</p>
