  content: "There is a very slim chance that some kind of sense will enter the heads
    of the Pakistani establishment and in the interest of self preservation they will
    defuse this confrontation for a while. But even if they do, the conflict will
    return because an irresistable force (the changing Pakistani society, with millions
    of people who want a minimum share of the pie) is meeting an immovable object
    (the criminal and corrupt establishment that has enjoyed insane levels of loot
    for 60 plus years and DOES NOT WANT TO SHARE A PENNY with anyone unless some armed
    group forcibly snatches it from them). The push for restoration of the judiciary
    is simply the most civilized aspect of a revolt from below that the establishment
    cannot control but refuses to compromise with (again, they do compromise when
    some armed group proves stronger than them locally).\r\n\r\nThe fact is, they
    have had a great ride for 60 years. They took the loss of East Pakistan in their
    stride and they have managed to sell their nuisance value to rich patrons from
    China to Saudi Arabia  to the big boss himself, Uncle Sam. But it seems they just
    dont have the vision to adjust their position to give some space to the new emerging
    middle class, not to speak of the terminally oppressed lowest classes.\r\n\r\nThe
    irony is that very minor compromises: some minimum justice, some very minimum
    opportunity to rise, some vague sense of participation in the state, would let
    the pressure out. Our culture has its share of rebelliousness, but there is also
    a lot of willingness to carry on and tolerate a good deal of nonsense.... but
    a fig leaf of respectability, some hint of opportunity is still needed and the
    powers that be wont even allow that. Maybe they can still learn??\r\n\r\nI do
    fear that rather than compromise, they will use violence.... maybe some of the
    terrorists still under their control will be unleashed at a crucial moment??"

<p>Some Long March pics. The current news is that they are stopping all buses, trucks from crossing the Sindh/Punjab border. Local press is reporting that Kiyani and the US both want the Long March "resolved". Whatever that means. </p>
<p>CM friend Anil has a nice <a href="http://michaeldorf.org/2009/03/deja-vu-all-over-again.html">run-down</a> of the Long March. And I ask you to continue keeping a eye on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23LongMarch">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.coveritlive.com/index.php?option=com_altcaster&task=siteviewaltcast&altcast_code=9afe309d00&height=550&width=470">Teeth Maestro</a>, and <a href="http://progpak.wordpress.com">APP</a> for the latest news. </p>
