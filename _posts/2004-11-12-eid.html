    <i>Here in America, at least for this year, all the Muslim organizations have banded to announce Eid on the same day - which I think is great.</i>

    Who cares about organizations?? Here in Atlanta, Eid is tomorrow at least in the majority of mosques. Caught me with surprise; I wasn't expecting a Saturday Eid.

    is of 29 days while in other parts it is a 30 day fasting. They just accounced
    sunday eid in pakistan, while we had to fast for another day. but look at the
    bright side. the eid is on same day in pakistan and usa.

    I WISH EID TO ALL MUSLIM BRETHERN. THE HUSTLE & BUSTLE OF EID AND ITS JOYFUL PREPARATIONS AND CELEBRATIONS ARE NOT SEEN ANY WHERE ELSE EXCEPT PAKISTAN.THE RAMADAN HAS ITS OWN BLESSINGS AND EID BEING THE " REWARD DAY" HAS ITS OWN SIGNIFICANCE.THE HAPPINESS ASSOCIATED WITH EID FESTIVAL TO MEET,VISIT AND TALK TO FAMILY, RELATIVES, NEIGHBOURS, AND FRIENDS IS SO EXCITING
    AND WARM. PEOPLE RUSH TO HOME FROM ABROAD TO CELEBRATE EID WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THE MOMENTS OF MEETINGS WITH DEAR AND NEAR ONE`S ARE FULL OF
    HAPPINESS AND GLADNESS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS. ASK THOSE WHO PLAN AND RETURN TO HOME ON THIS AUSPICIOUS DAY ESPECIALLY FROM MIDDLE EAST.
    I AM CELEBRATING EID WITH MY SONS IN SWEDEN AND ALTHOUGH I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE WITH THEM; I STILL MISS THE ZEAL AND ENTHUSIESM OF HOME COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CALL MANY RELATIONS AND FRIENDS IN PAKISTAN, YET I FEEL I MISS ALOT.
    I WISH VERY HAPPY EID TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

  content: don't know what 'organizations' you speak of....here in nyc the afghani
    guys at  'halal pizza 24 hrs" were eating on saturday to sync up with the saudis
    but we, along with our egyptian neighbors and the stray moroccan boy we've taken
    in, held out til sunday.   did ten bags of late night shopping for exotics at
    apna bazaar in jackson heights amid car stereos blaring bhangra and jay-walking
    saris flapping in the cold wind,  came home and hung twinkly lights in the front
    room.  aamir did a kick-ass mendhi on my left hand at 4 am and then woke up and
    made sayaaawyen (you know, that vermicelli dish whose name sounds like teenagers
    imitating chinese) and cooked six dishes (incl. the enemy karelas) for six people.  just
    finished the dishes.  eid mubarak !

<p><img src="/img/moon.jpg" align=left hspace=6>Eid ul Fitr (The Feast at the End of Fasting) is my favorite holiday. You get new clothes. You got <i>eidi</i> - cash, from all the adults and you strut about from house to house, awash in the smell of new threads and new greens, giving hugs to each and every person. Funny thing is that I always mess the hug-starting shoulder [your right-left-right].</p>
<p>The most exciting part of Eid is the night before (Chand Ra'at - Moon Night). That is the night <i>everyone</i> goes out <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com/archives/000124.html">shopping</a> or getting henna or watching girls <a href="http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_13735.shtml">get henna</a> and buying box loads of chur'ian (colored glass bangles). Like a gigantic Mardi Gras coupled with Pamplona. As the calendar is lunar based, lots of people go to the rooftops trying to see that new moon. Eid ul Fitr marks the end of Ramadan (the month of fasting), which can only be ascertained by the actual "sighting" of the new moon. </p>
<p>Last <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_16-11-2003_pg7_12">year</a>, there were three Eid ul Fitr in Pakistan. Based on when the new moon was sighted in Karachi (from the top of the Habib Bank Building) and Punjab, and two in Peshawar. Lunar madness, for real. As a result, many <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2003/11/26/local7.htm">called for</a> an end to the madness and have Eid proclaimed nationally throughout Pakistan. Others with turbans said, <a href="http://www.mrc.org.uk/celebrate%20eid%20on%20one%20day.htm">no way</a>. </p>
<p>Here in America, at least for this year, all the Muslim organizations have banded to announce Eid on the <a href="http://www.moonsighting.com/">same day</a> - which I think is great.  I always hope that Muslim holidays will seep into the American consiousness over time. Maybe, we can have our kids stay home like those xmas celebrating or hanukkah celebrating kids. Celebrating Eid across America is a great start. </p>
<p>To all my readers, Eid Mubarak. Hug a Muslim on Sunday. Or buy a <a href="http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_054.htm">stamp</a>. </p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>Duh! I totally spaced out that <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Culture/Festivals/Diwali.html">Diwali</a> started as well! Happy Diwali to all my friends! Now everyone, go party.</p>
