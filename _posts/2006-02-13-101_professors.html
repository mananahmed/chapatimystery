    The only thing more awesome than the graphic design of the book's cover&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg;with a circled F-as-in-you-FAIL! in "ProFessors&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg;is this, from the inside flap:

    "Coming to a Campus Near You: Terrorists, racists, and communists&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg; you know them as The Professors."

    What with all that, I should get paid more.

    (Hi.  I love your blog.)

    entry is great. Also, I did fail to notice that Vinay Lal made the list. Must
    send him a congratulatory note!"
