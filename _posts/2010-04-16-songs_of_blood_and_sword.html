  content: "Great review Manan. I haven't picked up the book myself but will read
    it as soon as time permits. I wonder to what extent this book exists to fulfill
    the need for a 'pure space' of critique in Pakistan. Amidst Zardari's corruption,
    the army, and the Taliban, Fatima seems to arrive as almost a saviour, complete
    with beauty, cosmopolitanism and a presumed skepticism born of her experience
    as an 'outsider.' Mir Murtaza's flaws, such as they were, seem to fade in light
    of the charges she brings against Benazir. In being dead for so long, he avoids
    being tainted, and so does she by appealing to his nobility...but in harnessing
    herself to her father and grandfather so uncritically, doesn't Fatima also risk
    dredging up a lot of old uncomfortable memories and debates? I don't know precisely
    who her audience is and what the public discussion will be like in Pakistan.  ps
    The photo in the Khushwant Singh review linked above is absolutely priceless!"

  content: so many people have been killed in violence in pakistan ,her own father
    killed so many people.She  should not accuse other people then they will accuse
    her father too.All her father friends from sindh were gangsters and criminals.Its
    very hard to lose a father but she should move on an do something positive rather
    than keep accusing and critisizing people.So many people have lost their   loved
    ones in pakistan due to violance.benazir bhutto's children lost their beloved
    mother too.fatima bhutto should stop accusing her dead aunt benazir bhutto.she
    is dead now.

  content: I do not have any idea about the personal character of Fatima but I do
    know that the Bhutto`s were always power hungry and there was always infighting
    within the family,both Murtaza and Shahnawaz were never men of good characters
    and Bhutto senior nationalized the Industry and screwed up the once flourishing  economy
    and it never got to stand up on its two feet again. He always spoke about what
    the poor wanted to hear to get the votes of the rural population of that country
    without actually doing anything for them.Benazir may have been a good leader (at
    least the western press projects her that way although she did nothing for the
    poor during her rule except travel in flashy cars) but she along with her husband
    have been accused of multiple corruption charges.

<p>I think my favorite part of Fatima Bhutto's <em>Songs of Blood and Sword</em> is the conversation she has with the octogenarian Samuel Huntington at Harvard about her father who took a class with him. It is a brilliant little scene full of awkwardness and confusion. I don't have the book here, else I would just type it out.</p>
<p>In any case, I have a review of the book up at <em>The Review</em>: <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100416/REVIEW/704159986/1008">Ghost Wars</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Songs of Blood and Sword can rightly be seen as the latest in a line of memoirs like Benazir's <em>Daughter of the East</em> and Pervez Musharraf's <em>In the Line of Fire</em> — each of them devoted to uncritical presentations of their authors or their families, made to stand in for the history of an entire nation. The tale of the Bhutto dynasty, from its feudal base to its populist claims and now to the stranger-than-fiction stewardship under Zardari (where else in this world can one bequeath a political party in a will?) still deserves to be told, and told properly.</p>
<p>This is not that book, and it should neither be sold nor judged as such: it is merely another primary document for that unwritten history, alongside the papers of her father, grandfather and aunt — which remain in the family home in Karachi.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn't expand on the last point in the review but I would like to stress here. </p>
<p>Fatima Bhutto quotes extensively from her father's papers, from diaries of Benazir Bhutto, which she found in 71 Clifton, and from other papers. I would plead with Fatima Bhutto to take the papers of her father, grandfather and aunt — which remain in the family home, and deposit them in a public archive. I cannot imagine that Harvard or Oxford or Berkeley (alma maters of all involved) would decline such a gift. If she has written this book to make peace with her father's memory, the availability of these documents would go a long way toward making peace with the history and memory of her country. </p>
