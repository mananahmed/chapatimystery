<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/23/tracking-taxes-millions-spent-send-professors-vacation/">Seriously!</a> </p>
<p>In the list of horrible waste of tax-payer's hard earned money exposed by Fox News, I saw this: </p>
<blockquote><p>$50,000 to build a computer model of an ancient city in Pakistan complete with "animated and interactive 'inhabitants'. </p></blockquote>
<p>If history is our guide, it won't be long before these inhabitants fall to radical ideologies and turn back on the NEH! Agent-based computing models are already rife with terrorists and terrorist-sympathizers. We know this. </p>
<p>I was curious, so I managed to actually track this grant down: <a href="http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Default.aspx?tabid=111&id=125">Virtual Taxila: A Web-Accessible, Multi-User Virtual Environment (MUVE) of an Ancient Indian City</a> by Daniel Michon. </p>
<p>This cannot end well. </p>
