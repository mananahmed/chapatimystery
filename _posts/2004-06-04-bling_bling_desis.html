    a feeling i probably don't want to know.

<p>Let's just get it out in the open: No One Parties Like Us Desis. No one.<br />
Consider this latest case of our Bangladeshi brother, Tauhidul Chaudhury, who went, with three friends, one eventful night last October to a strip-joint in New York City called Scores. By the time the night was over and Mr. Chaudhry was bundled off in a taxicab, Scores had <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0603041scores1.html">charged him $129,626</a> for the seven hour stay. Shall I type that again? <b>$129,626 for seven hours in a strip club</b>. That's $18,518 per hour, $308 per second, and roughly $9,259 per <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7158628?cslink=search_name_noncust&ulink=search__searchslot1_520__0_profile_5_1">stripper</a>.<br />
In his defense, Mr. Charudhry declines to remember any of that memorable night. Which is a shame.<br />
Lest you say that I am generalizing the Desi community on the basis of one [poor] Bangladeshi, allow me to generalize based on TWO!<br />
Do you remember the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/26/world/main502269.shtml">six investment bankers who went to dinner</a> one fine evening in London and ended up in the Guiness Book of World? Barclay's London representatives Dayananda Kumar, Mahish Chandra and Iftikhar Hyder [a graduate of Pakistan's Institute of Business Administration] plunked down $62,679 on wine and cigars only.<br />
Mr. Kumar became my personal hero when he later declared:</p>
<div class= quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">To be honest, I'm not that bothered about it," Kumar was quoted as saying. "I've been on lots of expeditions since I left the bank. I went climbing on Everest, I've just come back from Kilimanjaro, and I'm off to the North Pole soon. It's no real problem.<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>and this after he ended up <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/02/24/ncity24.xml">losing his job</a> over the hoopla.<br />
That's a true Bling Bling spirit.<br />
Vu, can I get a <b>Bar Chicago?</b></p>
