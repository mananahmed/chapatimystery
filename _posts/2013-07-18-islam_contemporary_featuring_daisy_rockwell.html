<p>Instagram Islam and tag it #contemporary if you are in Pittsfield, MA in the dog days of summer. Our own Daisy Rockwell will have art featuring maybe bare breasts (and maybe bearded demagogues) in <a href="http://discoverpittsfield.com/islamcontemporary/">the show </a>along with a solid array of believers, non-believers from around the world. It promises to be a fairly representative sample of the world as we currently inhabit (ingredients include Islam). I will at the opening acting as the roadie to the superstar. Do visit. </p>
