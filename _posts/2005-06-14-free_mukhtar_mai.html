  content: The NYT had an editorial on this today. Unfortunately, no one in Washington
    seems to care - with Pervaiz promising to deliver (always low-level) Al-Qaeda
    terrorists, Bush seems content to ride with his man - after all both claim and
    strongly believe that divinity has something to do with their leading their respective
    countries

    Firstly, thanks sincerely for the post, sepoy.  It got me out of my own head and led me to do the same as you.

    In response to your update, I read that the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/storyview/MSN/world/national/2005/06/15/travelban-mai050615.html" rel="nofollow"> that the government confiscated her passport</a>.  Any news?

    Saurav: NYT, with an Islamabad byline, is stating that the ban is lifted and she is free to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/international/asia/16pakistan.html" rel="nofollow">move</a>. I have not seen any other report about confiscated passport. Let's see what develops.

    Mukhtar Mai is scheduled to be in Chicago mid-July. I am looking forward to hearing from her.

  content: Sepoy, here's the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4095912.stm"
    rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> quoting Mukhtar Mai that the easing of travel restrictions
    is "useless" because they still have her passport (a typical tactic).  If I weren't
    American and hadn't been here for the past 10 years, I would be able to believe
    how irresponsible the New York Times article is by printing that quote from the
    Pakistani government and presenting this as resolved when in fact it clearly is
    not.  What shoddy f@#king journalism (excuse my French).

    <strong>Reaction to Criticism</strong>

    The Bush administration responds to Amnesty International's cataloging of abuses in Gitmo and beyond by tarnishing Amnesty's name. The Musharraf regime saves Pakistan's reputation by not allowing Mukhtaran Bibi, a gang rape victim, to go abroad.

    I am sadded to hear of this situation.



    This is more evidence why the crazy countries such as Pakistan should be controlled by the USA. Thank goodness the USA is cleaning up Afghanistan and Iraq.



    It is funny how people condemn the USA but fall back for their assistance in time of need.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/freemai.jpg">In a bid to present the <a href="/archives/homistan/softer_side_of_freedom.html">softer side</a> of Pakistan, The General has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/pakistan/Story/0,2763,1505198,00.html">restricted</a> all movement of Mukhtar Mai - including any overseas travel. See, the softer side of Pakistan does not include any promotion of the fact that women get gang-raped by community consensus [<i>panchaiyat</i> or <i>jirga</i>] - when they are not bought, sold or killed by the same village elders. I don't even want to go into the "tradition" that allows men to barter and <a href="/archives/homistan/state_sanctioned_killings.html">kill women</a> for their honor and heritage. May the pox be on their houses. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mukhtarmai.com/Mai'sTragedy.htm">She</a> is an incredible woman who deserves the <a href="/img/mukhtarmaischool.jpg" target="blank">honor</a> of her people. Kristoff has some things to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/opinion/14kristof.html?ex=1276401600&en=c42b9627b013b9e9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">say</a> as well:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">Excuse me, but Ms. Mukhtaran, a symbol of courage and altruism, is the best hope for Pakistan's image. The threat to Pakistan's image comes from President Musharraf for all this thuggish behavior.<br />
I've been sympathetic to Mr. Musharraf till now, despite his nuclear negligence, partly because he's cooperated in the war on terrorism and partly because he has done a good job nurturing Pakistan's economic growth, which in the long run is probably the best way to fight fundamentalism. So even when Mr. Musharraf denied me visas all this year, to block me from visiting Ms. Mukhtaran again and writing a follow-up column, I bit my tongue.<br />
But now President Musharraf has gone nuts.</div>
<p>No. He hasn't gone nuts. He is doing what dictators do. Manage the PR. The best way to combat him is to spin this out of his hand. <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/WTPresidentMessage.aspx">Send him a note</a>. Write about this on your blogs. Write a letter to the  editor. Go to the <a href="http://www.4anaa.org/projects/mukhtaran-mai.htm">Rally</a>.</p>
<p>Do see <a href="http://www.4anaa.org/projects/mukhtaran-mai.htm">ANAA</a> [the sponsoring group].</p>
<p><b>update, jun 15: </b> Looks like the PR spun out of their hands. NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/international/middleeast/15cnd-pakistan.html?ex=1276488000&en=ebcb1c6b9aecd35b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">reports</a> that Shaukat Aziz ordered the lifting of travel restrictions. Great news.</p>
<p><b>update, jun 16: </b>Saurav pointed out in the comments that the great news is not so great. BBC is reporting that her passport has not been returned and that she has withdrawn her visa application from the US consulate. Quite a bad sign. Please do spread the word. Copy my graphic above to your sites and link to this post. I will try and keep it updated.</p>
<p><b>update, jun 17: </b>June 15th <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2005/48051.htm">press briefing from the Department of State</a>. Mukhtar Mai has an open invitation from the US, now. Whereabouts of her passport are still unknown. I am guessing that it will be found as soon as The General gets back into town. Such a bad, bad PR move.</p>
<p><b>update, jun 18: </b>There goes my hope that this was done by <i>chamchas</i>. Looks like The General is making his stand.</p>
<div id="blockquoted"><a href="http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jun/17pak1.htm">Musharraf said Mukhtar Mai, whose rape was ordered to punish her family for her brother's alleged affair with a woman from another family, was being taken to the United States by foreign nongovernment organizations "to bad-mouth Pakistan" over the "terrible state" of the nation's women. "She was told not to go" to the United States to appear on media there to tell her story, Musharraf told the Auckland Foreign Correspondents' Club. He said NGOs are "Westernized fringe elements" which "are as bad as the Islamic extremists." Musharraf acknowledged placing the 36-year-old on the list of people banned from leaving Pakistan while responding to media questions during a three-day visit to New Zealand.</a></div>
<p><b>update, jun 19: </b>Kristoff has a follow-up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/opinion/19kristof.html">op-ed</a>. Nitin provides a full <a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com/?p=1497">summary</a> of opinion coverage. Also, do see KO's excellent <a href="http://ko.offroadpakistan.com/pakistan/2004_10/mukhtaran_bibi_sentenced_to_be_raped.html">post</a>.</p>
<p><b>update, jun 21: </b><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/21/1335242">Interview</a> with Mukhtar Mai. It appears certain that she won't be traveling to the US anytime soon. Meantime, there is no <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/06/21/top4.htm">pressure</a> on Islamabad and The General is convinced that Pakistan's image got a <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/06/21/top3.htm">boost</a> from his trip to NZ. Saurav wrote in to remind all that there is a <a href="http://www.4anaa.org/NY%20PRESS%20CONFERENCE.pdf">press conference</a> [pdf] tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>update, jun 28:</b>see <a href="/archives/homistan/the_rosa_parks_effect.html">my later post</a></p>
