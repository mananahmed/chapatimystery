  content: "Interesting, though some of the chapters sound a little bit fluffy in
    terms of their subject matter considering the title of the volume.  I didn't
    see the earlier recommendations on your reading list before but after having gone
    through them, I will add some of my suggestions here (hope you don't mind), I
    might quibble slightly over the lack of (good)  single volume histories on Pakistan.
    I think Owen-Bennett Jones' 'Pakistan in the Eye of the Storm' is actually very
    good considering its size (less than 300 pages in a small page layout) and his
    chapters on the 1971 war and creation of Bangladesh as well as Musharraf's coup
    and the Kargil affair are very good. Think it would be best single intro for anybody
    unfamiliar with Pakistan. A more weighty history can be found in Christophe Jaffrelot's
    'A History of Pakistan and Its Origins' in the Anthem South Asia series - a decent
    volume that covers almost all the major themes and issues and far better than
    the Sri Lankan and Indian volumes in the same series.  I also understand
    the desire to avoid the military aspects which have been played to death but how
    can you have a reading list on Pakistan without anything on the Pakistan military:
    the standard Stephen Cohen's 'The Pakistani Army' (also available in Urdu I beleive)
    and the more interesting Shuja Nawaz's 'Crossed Swords: Pakistan, its Army, and
    the Wars Within' very good for its blistering critique of the Army and its performance
    from someone who has observed it from close quarters; provocative but in the wrong
    way is Brian Cloughley's 'War, Coups and Terror: Pakistan's Army in Years of Turmoil'
    an incredibly sympathetic, bordering on the semi-delusional account of the Pakistani
    army's recent years by someone who is clearly too much in love with the army for
    his own good.  Farzana Shaikh's 'Making Sense of Pakistan' is not a history
    but is a well thought out examination of Pakistani nationalism and politics with
    a lot of history thrown in, certainly gives much food for thought. More lightweight
    is Nicholas Schmidle's 'To Live or to Perish Forever: Two Tumultuous Years in
    Pakistan' very much a foreign journalist's account of his time in Pakistan but
    noteworthy because he actually manages to interview several figures like the Aziz
    brothers and travels to restricted areas like Gwadar to investigate the nature
    of infrastructure development there.  Also imo, Tariq Ali's book 'Can Pakistan
    Survive' is actually much better than his later works on anything to do with Pakistan;
    partly because it contains much more in-depth material and sociological/political
    observations on developments within the country and also because of its predictions
    and assumptions, which now more than 20 years later, lets you know when not to
    take this ubiquitous opinionist too seriously."

  content: "Thanks for adding what looks like a promising new book on Pakistan. I
    would also add that your reading list is relatively silent on Balochistan save
    Beatrice Nicolini's excellent article. I can think of at least four recent/contemporary
    works that should be on a critial reading list regarding Balochistan:   1)
    Ricardo Redaelli (1997) The Father's Bow: the Khanate of Kalat and British India.
    Manent (Firenze).  2) Simanti Dutta (2003) Imperial Mappings in Savage Spaces:
    Balochistan and British India. B.R. Publishing Corporation, India. 3) Beatrice
    Nicolini (2004) Makran, Oman and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in
    the Western Indian Ocean.  4) Paul Titus (1997)(Ed.)  Marginality and Modernity:
    Ethnicity and Change in Post-colonial Balochistan. Oxford University Press, Karachi."

<p>Very Promising new collection of essays on Pakistan. It will make a fine addition to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/readings_on_pakistan.html">this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.routledgepolitics.com/books/Beyond-Crisis-isbn9780415480635">Beyond Crisis: Re-evaluating Pakistan</a><br />
Edited by Naveeda Khan<br />
Published by: Routledge India<br />
Publication Date: 23/02/2010<br />
Pages: 544</p>
<blockquote><p>About the Book<br />
Through the essays in this volume, we see how the failure of the state becomes a moment to ruminate on the artificiality of this most modern construct, the failure of nationalism, an opportunity to dream of alternative modes of association, and the failure of sovereignty to consider the threats and possibilities of the realm of foreignness within the nation-state as within the self.</p>
<p>The ambition of this volume is not only to complicate standing representations of Pakistan. It is take Pakistan out of the status of exceptionalism that its multiple crises have endowed upon it. By now, many scholars have written of how exile, migrancy, refugeedom, and other modes of displacement constitute modern subjectivities. The arguments made in the book say that Pakistan is no stranger to this condition of human immigrancy and therefore, can be pressed into service in helping us to understand our present condition.
