  content: "I take it that the shadow line across the road marked the bowling crease?
     Sounds like your Tip Tip game probably honed quite a solid technique!"

<p>Of course we played in the streets, in the alley, by the fountain, on the farm; we played wherever a smooth surface, roughly 22 feet was available for us. But there was a special game that was played only in our house. Only by the brothers and their friends. Tip Tip we used to call it. The rules were severe. Any direct hit from the bat onto the left wall, into the garden, any plant was out. As was a snick. You could only score by hitting straight and on the ground. Straight bats were actually the only possible way to play and longevity on the crease was the only possible victory. </p>
