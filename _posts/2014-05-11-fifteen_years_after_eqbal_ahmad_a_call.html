  content: Nice one, Sepoy. I learnt just recently that Eqbal was a Formanite. I used
    to read his articles in the Dawn in the 90s - with little understanding, I think.

  content: "i am a photographer and produced a 3-year long project that was inspired
    by an eqbal ahmed interview with david barsamian. the work - nearly complete,
    can be seen here: http://www.asimrafiqui.com/blog.   warscapes magazine
    recently published one of my pieces, along with photographs, from ayodhya, which
    was the first city i traveled to for the project. you can see that here: http://www.warscapes.com/retrospectives/india/breathing-life-and-death-gods-and-men  i
    would love to see if you would consider not just text but perhaps something from
    the project along with photographs? eqbal ahmed, whom i only read and never met,
    was a huge influence and the real voice behind the entire journey and exploration.

  content: Me and a colleague, Dan Freeman-Maloy, refer to the Selected Writings of
    Eqbal Ahmed simply as "the bible". His influence is so pervasive that it's almost
    impossible to identify exactly how... but I will give it a try.

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2014/05/eqbalahmad.png" alt="eqbalahmad" width="223" height="539" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9049" /> Today marks the fifteenth anniversary of the passing of Eqbal Ahmad (1932 - 1999). Who was Eqbal Ahmad?</p>
<p>On 10 Feb, 1971, a letter appeared in <em>The New York Times</em> titled "Eqbal Ahmed: A Defense" signed by faculty at Princeton. </p>
<blockquote><p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Leaders in the movement to end the prolonged, cruel and useless violence against millions in Indochina have now been indicted by the Justice Department for conspiracy to blow up a heating system and kidnap a Presidential adviser. As Fathers Daniel and Phillip F. Berrigan have already right said, such a plot would be a "grotesque" response by "deranged" people - a "caricature" of the dedicated mass action still required to end the war.</p>
<p>We are writing about one of those indicted - a former student at Princeton and a good friend, Eqbal Ahmad, now a Fellow at the Adlai Stevenson Institute of International Affairs. </p>
<p>Everything we know about Dr. Ahmad is contrary to that of which he is accused. He is a scholar in political science who has established an international reputation with his published work on revolution. He has also translated his analysis into action.</p>
<p>He was one of the first to denounce romantic revolutionaries for substituting personal heroics for truly difficulty task of fashioning new links among the exploited, the powerless, the excluded and those who know what sustained work is required to transform individuals and society. </p>
<p>His writings have analyzed the disadvantages of conspiracy and terror when used by revolutionaries and emphasized the need to concentrate on isolating all unjust regimes morally and politically. A group of extreme leftist students last year stormed into the Adlai Stevenson Institute and deliberately destroyed Eqbal Ahmad's research notes. </p>
<p>In our view, Eqbal Ahmad understands well the underlying social forces that impel rulers to persist in runious wars, and allow revolutionaries with deep roots among their own people to succeed despite the might brought against them by great powers. This among other things has made him a first-rate teacher and analyst and also one of the most persuasive opponents of the Vietnam war on campuses in this country and abroad.</p>
<p>Eqbal Ahmad's public record of scholarship and advocacy makes the accusation appear highly implausible to us. </p>
<p>Henry Bienen, Kathyrn Boals, Henry H. Eckstein, Richard A. Falk, Manfred Halpern.<br />
Princeton, N. J. Feb. 1, 1971<br />
<em>The writers are members of Princeton University faculties</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Edward Said, when <a href="http://www.tni.org/archives/act/3895">remembering</a> Eqbal Ahmad, did so with such love and grace that every single time I have read those words, I have found myself transported to those conversations Said notes - with Darwish, or Faiz or Paley. </p>
<p>Yet, Said left unsaid what Ahmad would mean to the future, our present. The Harrisburg Seven are now forgotten. I rarely find Ahmad cited in contemporary scholarship and I rarely see his figure evoked in a genealogical manner to the many critical thoughts on empire or global south. He did not leave behind "the big book" I guess. Perhaps most critically, I have rarely heard young scholars of Pakistan incorporate his work into their own. </p>
<p>A small group of us, wish to mark today, the anniversary of <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/mah7.html">Eqbal Ahmad</a>'s fifteenth year, and raise a call for submissions. We wish to create a small print 'zine to be published in Fall 2014. We ask for reflections on Eqbal Ahmad's work and the ways in which it intersects with your own practices and theologies. Please contact me or leave your contact information in comments, if you are interested. We would also like you to read Eqbal Ahmad, if you have not encountered him before. We recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Selected-Writings-Eqbal-Ahmad/dp/0231127111">The Selected Writings of Eqbal Ahmad</a> (2006).</p>
<p>You can also look at the <a href="http://www.saadigitalarchive.org/browse/subject/eqbal-ahmad?search_api_views_fulltext">archivization project</a> at our beloved SAADA on Eqbal Ahmad. </p>
<p>We thank you. </p>
