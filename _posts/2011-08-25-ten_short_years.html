<blockquote>The New York Police Department is doing everything it can to make sure there's not another 9/11 here and that more innocent New Yorkers are not killed by terrorists,&rdquo; NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said. &ldquo;And we have nothing to apologize for in that regard.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In the months after 9/11, the FBI deployed its investigative apparatus as a blunt weapon. In November 2001, the Department of Justice began conducting &ldquo;voluntary interviews&rdquo; with 5,000 Middle Eastern non-citizens. Hundreds of FBI agents were dispatched across the country to conduct the interviews, with standard questions like &ldquo;Are you aware of anybody who reacted in a surprising way about the terrorist attacks? Maybe you got to work and maybe a coworker said, 'Good, I'm glad that happened'?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
