    Your efforts are commendable...thoroughly, commendable...I, likewise applaud your efforts.

    I must confess though for I feel a little weird ordering a T-shirt (I LOVE The Kashmir design)..its like when PBS has their fundraisers and they send you The Australian Pink Floyd DVD's for pledging $200...but at the same time you can choose not to get the gift since it costs them money to send you a gift...that is sort of what I feel. I just feel like the T-shirt will be tainted for me--I would just wanna help for the sake of helping. Ofcourse this by no means suggests that you are doing like I said your efforts are sincere and noble...

    I just can't get myself to buy that Kashmir T-shirt, despite the fact that I really want to and probably should :-)

    the tshirt is cool. It doesn't matter in the end, does it? The fundraising world
    has a model for every scenario. \nI totally see what you mean, though, I am gearing
    these tshirts for the second and third wave of donation."

    Just came across this site, through a link at Karachi metblog. I am surprised I never came to know about its existence, despite being a history freak.
    Good work with the t-shirts guys. Let me sum up the dimes and nickels in my pocket and i'll buy one for sure.

    The t shirt designs are awesome, and i will pick one up when i go back to the states this winter.

    As for Edhi Foundation, i drive by their islamabad compound on the way to college everyday, and the amount of goods they had collected within days of the quake was staggering. the entire courtyard of their "edhi home" in isb was full to the brim with blankets, drinking water, and other goods. i have had trouble figuring out which charity to give to ('the president's fund' doesn't really have a philanthropic ring to it, and i'm sure only a percentage of my money will ever reach kashmir if i go through that route), but i can definitely vouch for edhi. donate generously!

    Hey--I love "Chai Nation" and am wondering if you can select it in American Apparel for women.  I only support sweat shop free stores and would love to buy it to support your mission.  However, I would feel weird wearing it if the tag said, "Made in Pakistan" or some other country where workers' wages are not supported.  Just my two cents.

    Thanks Sepoy for listening...and really appreciate the amazing effort.
