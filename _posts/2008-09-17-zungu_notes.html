  content: "And it makes me imbue this upcoming election with a symbolism that raises
    the stakes so far above and beyond their already frighteningly high level that
    it makes me wonder if the gods are just fucking with us. Seriously, are we living
    in a didactic morality play? Are we really presented with the choice between a
    person whose identity is defined by his time as a bomber in an American war of
    imperial aggression and a guy with a &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo;
    name who wears centuries of America's violent racial oppression
    on his skin? Are you fucking serious? Love it."
