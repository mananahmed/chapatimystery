  content: "I think we (the chattering bloggerati) may be guilty of swinging too quickly
    from one extreme to another. One day no one in Pakistan is ready to fight the
    taliban, the next day the taliban are not a threat to a strong and determinedly
    anti-taliban Pakistan. The real story is hard to follow...\r\nPersonally, I think
    the state is stronger than the doomsday scenarios suggest, but not strong enough
    to \"solve the problem\" whenever it likes. My prediction is that we will be skirting
    uncomfortably close to disaster for the foreseeable future, but with a little
    luck, will continue to have a semi-functional state in Punjab and Sindh. But I
    dont think the pak army (for all this talk of \"mehsud is a minor irritant\")
    is capable of retaking the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan EVEN If it wanted to.
    Which also means that terrorism directed from that emirate is going to be with
    us for many years to come. My reasons for saying so:\r\n1. The \"good taliban\"
    to which the army is still so attached are the ones fighting NATO forces in Afghanistan.
    NATO is in no mood to just get up and leave Afghanistan at this time. That means
    there will be a war on that side of the border for at least a few years. In that
    war, the good taliban are going to use FATA as their safe haven. US drones are
    going to target them and if you go to \"danger room\" at \"wired.com\", you can
    find out what a vast drone armada is being assembled for this purpose. Saleem
    Shahzad (or his sources/bosses in the intelligence agencies) must know that NATO
    will not simply ignore these sanctuaries. And if they think they can convince
    their \"good taliban\" to move to afghanistan and fight entirely from there, then
    again they are mistaken. In this situation, sustained efforts to destabilize pakistan
    and force the army to get the drone war to stop are unavoidable.\r\n2. The Americans
    may have had premature panic attacks over buner, but they have been around in
    this world for a long time too. The idea that they will keep paying the pak army's
    expenses while the \"good taliban\" are left unmolested and continue to fight
    them in Afghanistan seems rather optimistic to me. certainly, they are willing
    to tolerate some \"local adjustments\" but not at the price of leaving their main
    enemies unmolested.\r\n3. Jihadi Islam may be a minority sect in Islam, but they
    are not just an instrument that the \"secular\" army uses to fight its wars in
    afghanistan and India and turns on and off as needed. The true believers are true
    believers. They want that version of Islam everywhere and they certainly want
    it in all of Pakistan. They are far-sighted enough to compromise with unvieled
    women from \"crisis cell\" for a few years, but they are not giving up their ambitions.
    Public opinion in the english speaking classes may have finally swung against
    them (why was it ever in their favor? doesnt that tell you something disturbing
    about the English speaking peoples of Pakistan?) but there is a very real lack
    of ISLAMIC intellectual ammunition against jihadi islam. That vocabulary is rather
    limited. Its limitations will eventually be overcome (I have always argued that
    \"in the long run\" Jihadi Islam is not compatible with minimum coexistence in
    the modern world and will have to be pushed into a fringe role by \"mainstream
    islam\", but that non-jihadi mainstream islam is still mostly confined to the
    imagination of Muslim MBAs in Harvard, its not the version you get in any islamiyat
    text yet), but until then, the jihadis have the intellectual advantage and I think
    the news of the jihadi's demise is premature at this point."

  content: "What on earth has happened to Vir Sanghvi?  By \"hit back\" it is clear
    what is proposed: it is an appeal for covert terrorist operations -- Sanghvi doesn't
    seem to realize that these sorts of solutions undermine the self-congratulatory
    liberalism he wishes to anoint himself with.  Liberalism is a slender reed, and
    cannot bear the weight of complacency.\r\n\r\nEven as an empirical matter, Sanghvi
    problematically assumes that the recent problems are due to the \"strong\" pakistan,
    and that an enfeebled Pakistan would be better -- but one could just as easily
    say that events like the Mumbai attacks, the many voices with which the Pakistani
    establishment speaks, etc., are all evidence of the enfeebled Pakistan, not the
    strong one -- IMO, the weaker the civilian Pakistani state, the harder it will
    be to prevent future attacks like Mumbai.\r\n\r\nThe broader problem, of course,
    and to be fair to Sanghvi, is that the many Indian liberals feel let down in the
    wake of the Mumbai attacks, on the theory that if after years of the peace process
    etc., there have been no practical advantages in terms of the militant organizations,
    collusive elements in the military-intelligence establishment, then what is the
    point?  It is easy to pooh pooh this concern, but it does present a practical
    problem: because it is undeniably the case that such steps have not been taken,
    or simply cannot be taken.  Whatever else this means for Pakistan, it does put
    the pro-peace contingent in India on a sticky wicket."

  content: 'Sepoy: I think you are being a bit unfair to Hanif''s piece.  As I read
    that op-ed, its focus is on the cultural aspects of the situation, specifically
    what he sees as the middle class'' blindness/naivete/etc. with respect to the
    Taliban ideology, and perhaps even its witting or unwitting promotion of that
    ideology.  I do not think he is peddling hysteria about the coming MILITARY victory
    of the Taliban.  Perhaps your point is that the "meaning" of the Hanif piece will
    be determined by the backdrop of all these other pieces about the country that
    are appearing, and perhaps Hanif should have been more careful, but I do think
    a distinction can and ought to be drawn.'

  content: "This umbrella organization \"Taliban&rdquo; [1] has indeed becoming
    a catch-all phrase. I suspect a lot of the rhetoric regarding \"Talibanization
    of Karachi\" stems from the ethnic tensions in Karachi and &ldquo;Talibanization&rdquo;
    is at least partly a sort of racist expression against Karachi's Pashtun as this
    BBC piece seems to suggest [2]. This isn't to say that there aren't any Taliban
    militants in Karachi, but only to say that this threat scenario might have become
    a political tool for parties and some \"culture-warriors\" of Karachi, and that
    a Taliban take over of Pakistan or for that matter Karachi is over-blown. [3]
    \r\n\r\n&ldquo;and in elections they garner less than 10 percent
    of the vote.&rdquo; I didn't know that Taliban have
    contested in elections or may be Hanif means that the political parties that are
    largely supported by conservative or fundamentalist voters, are the same as Taliban.
    His piece indeed blurs the lines and thus contributes to propelling hysteria.
    Militant = Violent Extremist = Extremist = Fundamentalist = Conservative = Terrorist
    (Add Pakistani/Muslim to this list of popular contemporary synonyms if you live
    outside Pakistan [4] ) \r\n\r\nIf I may use the words of Mahmood Mamdani outside
    the context of Darfur, \"This voyeuristic approach accompanies a moralistic discourse
    whose effect is both to obscure the politics of the violence and position the
    reader as a virtuous, not just a concerned observer.&rdquo; &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    &ldquo;Journalism gives us a simple moral world, where a group of
    perpetrators face a group of victims, but where neither history nor motivation
    is thinkable because both are outside history and context. Even when newspapers
    highlight violence as a social phenomenon, they fail to understand the forces
    that shape the agency of the perpetrator. Instead, they look for a clear and uncomplicated
    moral that describes the victim as untainted and the perpetrator as simply evil.\"
    [5]\r\n\r\nA columnist doesn't need to be familiar with or student of anthropology,
    politics, history, international relations; etc. He/She doesn't need to be a scholar
    at all or cite any substantial sources. Yet a sensationalist/alarmist columnist
    would get a greater readership than a scholar would since fear sells, never mind
    that fear mongering may make the threat look a lot bigger than it really is. \r\n\r\n1:

    is pretty hysterical about the growing jihadi Islamic rancour (events like Mumbai

    Christianity or Hindu - mixed with poverty, and illetracy is as potent as any
    nuclear weapon, only slower. No matter what NYT or any Aamerican media says, clearly
    Pakistan, in Zardari's limited potential, has a problem.

  content: "Hanif's piece in Wapo seems to be a much edited version of his oped in
    the Hindustan Times. http://www.indianexpress.com/news/they-make-a-desolation-and-call-it-peace/452010/0\r\n\r\nThe
    main thing that worries me about this description and I find that reflected in
    Facebook status messages and blogposts of some friends from Pakistan (20 something
    college students and young professionals) in the attitude that the taliban video
    or the entire Taliban itself is a Western (or Hindu Zionist) conspiracy to destablize
    and invade Pakistan. Or alternately, argue that the Maulanas in Swat are a sort
    of democratic people's movement representing (as opposed to hijacking) the demands
    of the people. \r\n\r\n\r\nSanghvi has been going on this theme for a while http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/counterpoint/2009/03/12/the-same-people-surely-not/.
    He wrote a piece which challenged the notion that Indians and Pakistanis \"are
    the same people yaar\". What was reassuring is that when this was being circulated
    on a bunch of egroups,  people who are otherwise hawkish or have voted for the
    BJP shot back  annoyed emails saying that they had more in common with middle
    class Pakistanis than a lot of their own countrymen."

    than I is going to respond to this. Red, I understand you to mean that considering
    covert  intervention by one power in the affairs of another is conspiracy theory,
    that nations do not use of destabilization as a tool of foreign policy.  IMO:
    One must  disregard a major part of the historical record of international activity
    by national polities since the 1500's (and most likely before), in order to consider
    destabilization nothing more than 'conspiracy theory'."

  content: "Well, CM, I read a slightly more well-researched piece of work to understand
    the situation in Pakistan, Ahmed Rashid's 'Descent into Chaos'. While the Taliban
    is probably not going to take over Pakistan, the country does find itself in a
    fine mess. \r\n\r\nI mean in the long term, are Pakistanis in Punjab and Sindh
    okay with the NWFP (or atleast a large chunk of it) not under the government's
    control ? Particularly since it is crucial to maintaining the link with Afghanistan
    and China (Karakoram Highway is quite close by). \r\n\r\nAre the people in Pakistan
    comfortable in the knowledge that some in their army and intelligence value their
    links with these non-state actors more than their allegiance to the nation ? I
    dont think so.\r\n\r\nThese are serious and challenging questions that Pakistan
    has to resolve if the country wants to get on with its future. A decade or so
    ago Pakistans involvement in Kashmir did have India on the ropes in that state,
    now the situation seems very different. Although by no means is the status of
    Kashmir resolved, Pak has lost a lot of its power and credibility there. The same
    seems to be true in Afghanistan, where there is a (still weak) pro-India state
    taking shape. Pakistan is losing the geo-strategic game in South and Central Asia,
    and it wont be able to make up ground until it deals with the Taliban.\r\n\r\nYour
    leaders made the fundamental mistake of seeking parity with India by seeking the
    help of other powers like America and China, who never had great reason to be
    concerned the well-being of Pakistanis in general.\r\n\r\nSo the danger isnt really
    of Pakistan becoming a theocracy but getting stuck in a long battle with the Talibs
    like Sri Lanka did with the LTTE."

  content: "Re: \"How's that different from columnists all over
    the world attempting to partition the west bank, gaza or the golan from Israel?\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    even under Israeli law the West Bank and Gaza are NOT part of Israel -- they are
    simply occupied by it.  [Most of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are
    illegal even under Israeli law].  The Golan Heights were, I concede, annexed by
    Israel -- although that annexation is illegal under international law, it does
    mean that the Golan constitutes part of Israel under Israeli law.\r\n\r\nMore
    broadly, it is not a case of columnists attempting to foist these \"solutions\"
    onto Israel: even many right-of-center Israelis have long recognized that the
    Golan will have to be given up if peace with Syria is to be obtained.  Certainly
    the Israeli center and left is reconciled to that possibility as a theoretical
    matter, and even right-of-center politicians like Ariel Sharon were reconciled
    with that by the end of his life.  On the West Bank and Gaza, you forget that
    the Israeli state has accepted, as part of the Oslo process, the idea that the
    West Bank and Gaza will be the future Palestinian state (it is unclear whether
    the new government intends to renege on those commitments).  Thus the occupied
    territories are not an instance of \"disputed borders\", even under Israeli law
    (maybe Jerusalem is, since that has been annexed, albeit international law does
    not, if I recall correctly, recognize the annexation of East Jerusalem; but the
    West Bank and Gaza have not been annexed by Israel and there is no dispute, whether
    under Israeli or any other law, that they are occupied.\r\n\r\nThe above is not
    merely an idle debate: the crucial difference is that in the Israel example, whatever
    territorial issues are or are not on the table are debated within Israeli society,
    and x or y solution has this or that constituency to support or oppose it.  Whereas,
    when one speaks of \"solutions\" like the partition-Iraq-into-three notion that
    was big a few years ago, or the sort of thing the Slate article seems to plug
    (at least in a de facto, if not a de jure) way, the \"solutions\" don't have any
    meaningful political reality on the ground in the areas concerned -- they exist
    in the minds of people at think tanks, in op-ed pages, etc. Only a colonial privilege
    could ever make these \"solutions\" reality, or even advance them in any serious
    way.  Thus the comparison with Israel/West Bank/Gaza is inapposite.  [A better
    example would be if columnists in the West, in the mainstream media, kept advocating
    a ONE-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, despite the fact that hardly
    any Israeli Jew that I am aware of would support such an outcome.  But of course
    they do not: advocacy of the ONE-state solution is a rather fringe preoccupation
    in the West, and is not deemed an acceptable solution by any Western government,
    or mainstream media outlet (at least in the US or the UK, or Canada, the markets
    I am more familiar with)].\r\n\r\nAside: there is a connection between Israel
    and Pakistan, but in the historical sense -- Chaudhury Rehmat Ali is known to

  content: "Q, I think Israel avoids using terms like annexation wrt the Golan hieghts
    even though it has passed legislation extending civil and military control over
    the region. I can't see it being given up though; Israel has done a huge amount
    to try and inculcate a consciouness amongst its population that the golan heights
    belongs to them; I remember a piece on an Israeli tourism ministry brochure advertising
    \ Israelis to go and visit the Golan hieghts and esitmates that something like
    20% of Israeli Jews have done so. There is a clear ideological move to establish
    the inalienability of the land with the state of ISrael. I can't see it being
    given up like the Sinai.\r\n\r\nAs for the settlements, I think Israeli law has
    become more ambiguous over recent years; now there is a move to claim that such
    lands were iether state owned or vacant and so can be taken for settlement building.
    There is little chance that the major settlements will be given up and polling
    on two-state solutions indicates that amongst Israelis there is little support
    to abandon the major settlements to a Palestinian state. Israeli state policy
    indicates that whatever the legal niceties the policy on the ground tends to be
    maximalist with the intention that it will not be reversed.\r\n\r\n<i>Aside: there
    is a connection between Israel and Pakistan, but in the historical sense &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    Chaudhury Rehmat Ali is known to have modeled his idea on Zionism &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    and hence in the philosophical sense &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; both countries were
    conceived as homelands for religious communities, yet not religious states per
    se (i.e. communal identity was conceived as an ethnicity as opposed to a conventional
    religion)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother ironic similarity is that Zionism was the national
    project of Ashkenazi Jews, not Mizrahi Jews; who number in equal numbers in the
    state. Indeed, Ashkenazis are a minority within their own state and had to absord
    large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from Arab countries who had not history or linkages
    with the Zionist movement. A parallel with the way that most parts of Pakistan
    were not the epicentre of the Pakistan movement which was in the United Provinces."

    most people qualify this statement with the claim that the media is in on the
    grand conspiracy. as a member of the pakistani media, i can assure you that it
    is largely incompetent and reactionary. it's not a good thing, but it does ensure
    that it does not have the ability to orchestrate a grand conspiracy. it can barely
    get its campaigns going properly.\r\n\r\nyet for most people, there is this huge
    mega-Grand Game underway that is being planned to get them. it's quite frightening,
    this apathy.\r\n\r\non aside, sometimes i wonder if 30-40 years from now, college

    aren't there parallels to be drawn between the leftist movements of then and the

  content: "\"sav: sure, we should do it on CM.\"\r\n\r\nYay!  But I'm not too sure
    where to start, rather ignorant on the issue except for a few bits knowledge here
    and there. Maya Shatzmiller has a really great anthology of non-Muslim minorities
    in Muslim countries and she has included a really insightful piece by Richard
    C.  Martin on the construction of minorities in Islamic law and 'custom' and a
    piece on The effects of Zia's policies on Pakistani Christian communities. These
    two alone suggest that it is a lot more complicated than much of the recent hype.
    In the Pakistani Christian case, there's always the stigma of Caste status that
    contributes to the way many are treated in society.  Other minority groups are
    treated with great ambiguity in society ranging from ignoring them or sometimes
    \"vigilante\" violence.  However, this is really linked to zia and bhutto's policies
    and parts of Martin's essay can't apply for all time to the pakistani middle classes.
    I always hear about the 'secular' culture of Pakistan urban society in the 1950's
    and 1960's, but I don't know where to put it (contextually).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Nationalism-Minority-Identities-Societies-Conflict/dp/0773528482/ref=sr_1_2/190-0056694-6864073?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1240918928&amp;sr=1-2\r\n\r\n

    examples, and still hope that you are right,  that the whole thing about pakistan
    turning into a theocracy is nothing but an editorial trick. I wasn't aware of

    liberal islands.\r\n\r\nwe can say anything we want to, and we should, about hacks,
    about those who hate them, about taliban, about not-quite-Taliban, but when we
    start using throwaway expressions about 'out of work barbers'  or threatening
    letters to schools (conflict of interest declaration: have a son who goes to school)
    or girls schools reopening (have met a lot of girls who did don't go to school
    anymore because their schools are, well not there anymore), i begin to wonder...\r\ndo

    elements gaining strength. I do take your point that the ordinary Pakistani (however
    we can determine who she is) may be complacent. I do understand that the logic
    of an Islamic state can over-determine what is unfolding or about to unfold. I
    surely see your point about the many small defeats to a more tolerant public sphere.
    \n\nMy quibble with your op-ed is that the \"Taliban\" do not equal \"the conservatives\".
    One need fought in the military realm. The other in the realm of ideas. When you
    write of \"surrender\" or of the \"inevitable rise of the Taliban to power\",
    I am not sure I can make out any differentiation. Since by the op-ed's rationale,
    we expect to see Maulana Fazlullah sitting in Zardari's chair with Mullah Omar's
    oil painting installed behind him. I don't think you mean that. Or maybe you do.
    \ \n\nAs for the Zeitgeist, it is hard to miss. NYT, Foreign Affairs, WaPo, Time,
    Newsweek, random Slate or Salon or HuffPo pieces are all filled with the \"Fall
    of Pakistan\". There is no rational way to deal with hysteria. I certainly have
    no counter. I mock. But then, some of these recent writing are epic failures of
    recognizing reality."

  content: Dear Hanif Sahib - if you're going to write op-eds for the Washington Post,
    surely it makes sense to understand your audience?  Especially if you happen to
    be a journalist and one based for a long time in the West.  So excuse me if I
    find your professed ignorance - bordering on naivete - a little disingenuous.  Unfortunately,
    as Sepoy points out, you fall into many of the same traps as other Pakistani liberal
    intellectuals (and this is a critique from the left) when you fail to make distinctions
    between the various groups/ideas/organizations/ideologies/politics that pass under
    the sign of 'Islamist'.  The issue of the 'Islamization' of our middle classes
    AND much of our elite is an issue that needs to be talked about again and again.  And
    we need to address it openly and figure out how to deal with it.  But I'm sure
    you'll agree that that purpose is not served by writing op-eds in THE media outlet
    that is in the forefront of constructing consent for an expansion of a horribly
    deadly 'War without end' which, by the way, isn't working, except in reverse.

    city, calls for jihad. Adverts for luxury Umrah pilgrimages are omnipresent. \r\nAnd

    are frequent warnings that the Taliban are headed toward Karachi; absurdly so,

    The likes of Amir Liaqat Hussain are despicable for inciting hate crimes, but
    to depict conservatives, evangelists, and Taliban to be the same is fear-mongering
    or \"zealotry\" of another kind that Hanif will be quick to point out as such
    if a bearded man puts liberalism, secularization, modernization, westernization,

    had to say about consistency of Jihadis purpose and tribal mentality\r\n\r\n\"Saudi
    Arabia is the holy place of Muslims, Mecca and Medina. There had never been foreign
    troops there. In 1990, during the Gulf War, they went in, in the name of helping
    Saudi Arabia defeat Saddam Hussein. Osama Bin Laden remained quiet. Saddam was
    defeated, but the American troops stayed on in the land of the kaba (the sacred
    site of Islam in Mecca), foreign troops. He wrote letter after letter saying,
    Why are you here? Get out! You came to help but you have stayed on. Finally he
    started a jihad against the other occupiers. His mission is to get American troops
    out of Saudi Arabia. His earlier mission was to get Russian troops out of Afghanistan.
    See what I was saying earlier about covert operations?\r\n\r\nA second point to
    be made about him is these are tribal people, people who are really tribal. Being
    a millionaire doesn't matter. Their code of ethics is tribal.
    The tribal code of ethics consists of two words: loyalty and revenge. You are
    my friend. You keep your word. I am loyal to you. You break your word, I go on
    my path of revenge. For him, America has broken its word. The loyal friend has
    betrayed. The one to whom you swore blood loyalty has betrayed you. They're
    going to go for you. They're going to do a lot more.\"\r\nhttp://www.sangam.org/ANALYSIS/Ahmad.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow
    Sec Def Donald Rumsfeld summarized the  Washington official mind set in  October
    2001:    \" Either we change the way WE  live, or we must change the way THEY
    live. We choose the later.\"\r\n\r\nSo wher do we stand with US or Them? Or is
    there another saner choice!"

    \r\nAgain going back to the political/Military context of Pakistani Scene and
    yes first reviewing the US Political scene as two are intertwined.\r\nWhen Rumsfeld
    pronounced   \r\n\"Either we change the way WE live, or we must change the way
    THEY live. We choose the later.&rdquo;\r\nGeorge W Bush declared \"Freedom
    is on the march\"\r\nPervaiz Musharraf said ' \" You have our unstinted support\"\r\nIn
    this back ground US/NATO forces landed in Afghanistan to act as a Hammer while
    Pakistan Army advanced to FATA to act as an ANNVIL. Plan was simple, to crush
    the AQ/Taliban etc in this brilliant strategy. That was some 7-8 years ago. Hence
    began the occupation of AF-PAK. Now occupations bring along some complications
    like pointed out in Robert Pape's well researched book &ldquo;Dying
    To Win, The Logic Of Suicide Terrorism\"\r\n\r\nTaliban movement which started
    as few thousands orphans and displaced youth as a result of Russian Occupation
    of Afghanistan, (  per Ahmad Rashid in his book ,  Taliban &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;),
    have since become the Monster or the Boogey men depending on what prism you use
    to look at them. It is incredible that Taliban has become such a force real or
    imagined .If recent past is any guide, we had similar hysteria with Iraq and WMDs,
    as we are going through Taliban and Pakistan.\r\nFast forward to today the Army
    started action (in Buner/Lower Dir) and got the good news of having emergency
    help of 200-400 million dollars from US Congress. That is about twice the rate
    US was paying Army during Musharraf time for the same job. So what happens next
    as the events is clearly not following the Imperial script. The pesky Lawyers
    insisting for rule of Law, poor demanding cheap bread, everybody missing electricity
    for 10s of hours. By uniting public against Taliban the magician keep performing
    the tricks while we debate the distractions. To give you an example, in Musharraf's
    last days in certain cantonment towns the Jawans were told not to go out in uniform
    because of open public hostility, now Military becomes hero standing  up to \"TALIBROTHA\"
    \    while  securing US AID at the same time, seems like win win situation albeit
    for short time."

    of Pakistan knows how important keeping it is to keep nuclear bombs from getting

    played by the United States in creating the Taliban in the first place. Washington
    once took pride in the success it enjoyed funneling arms and assistance to fundamentalist
    Afghans waging jihad against foreign occupiers. During the administrations of
    Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, this was considered to represent the very acme
    of clever statecraft. U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen caused the Soviets

    Americans themselves -- and has U.S. forces today bogged down in a seemingly endless

  content: "WHO IS SINCERE WITH SINDH AND SINDHIS?\r\n\r\nWhen I am composing this
    letter, a eminent new paper daily Jang is in my hands when I looked at page No.11
    of this paper, I am exclaimed and lamented when I saw a advertisement for jobs
    for several posts of 67 deferential designations from B.PS-1 t0 14 in department
    namely Institute of Karachi, in the requirements it is clearly mentioned that
    the candidates bearing Karachi domicile can apply only! I would like to request
    also for attention to the fact of  admissions in Dow Medical University ; where
    students belonging to the interior Sindh has been denied for their right to study
    in institutions of their mother land even the Administration of DOW Medical College
    rejected the orders of CM for admissions of Sindhis &amp; Chief Minister could
    not dare to take any action against them &amp; Sindhi student are not being allowed
    to study in DMC, Karachi University  and NED University and others several educational
    institutions.  The City government also notified and circulated that notice to
    all administrations of factories and industries in Karachi in which they directed
    and restricted to recruit the labors and other employees only with domicile of
    Karachi. Few days before, one advertisement for jobs in several subjects in the
    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF URDU UNIVERSITY was published in only Urdu news paper only
    to keep the people of interior Sindh un aware and far from their right of employment.
    \r\n\r\nNow a days , an other trick &amp; tactic has been taken the by the Minister
    of health who belong with Mutahida Qoumi Movement , to through all Sindhi Doctors
    from hospitals of Karachi and it is argued from him that interior Sindh has need
    of these specialists. Why Minister of health who belong with Mutahida Qoumi Movement
    does  not know that there are so many other specialist doctors are already serving
    in other districts of Sindh and only few or some specialist doctors are serving
    in hospitals of Karachi but we know it is the part of their policy and Sindhi
    doctors, teachers and other officials are as needles in theirs eyes and now they
    like to through out them from Karachi even the families of all those doctors and
    other employees are settled in Karachi and their kids are also studying in schools
    of Karachi. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of health in hands of MQM from last two eras
    and in last Government Thousands of Doctors and thousands others related with
    MQM were appointed unlawfully  by former Government  without any merit have not
    been terminated. The  MQM unlawfully recruited more than 5000 (five thousands)
    workers in Water Board and those are all are still enjoying their un lawful jobs
    and no any quota was given to rural Sindh. The 18000 (Eighteen Thousands) workers
    of MQM are recruited in Community Police of Karachi and no any employment was
    given to Sindhis as per their ratio in Karachi. Thousands of MQM Doctors appointed
    by former Government without any merit have not been terminated. It is not sufficient
    to keep a Sindhi cap on head and to wear Ajrak but all have to prove their sincerity
    with Sindh and Sindhi people by their acts. It is quit good to remember Sindhis
    in bad times but it is so than former to act for their goodness in good to time.
    \ \r\n\r\nNow, several questions raised in our minds just like:\r\n\r\n1.\tAre
    the doors for jobs and educational institutions in Karachi closed for indigenous
    people of Sindh, who are masters and owner of this land?\r\n\r\n2.\tIs the Karachi
    not a part of Sindh? \r\n\r\n3.\tIs it not fact that constitution of Islamic Republic
    of Pakistan allows only distribution of Civil Services of Sindh only on Rural
    and Arban basis by ration of 60:40?\r\n\r\n4.\tIs there any constitutional or
    administrative policy which allows discriminating people of Sindh in regard of
    recruitment and admissions in departments and in educational institutions? \r\n\r\n5.\tWhy
    representation of Sindh is silent in Assemblies and on other forums?\r\n\r\n6.\tWhy
    all NGOs and Political parties are silent on this fact?\r\n\r\n7.\tAre hidden
    agreements in between Political parties, NGOs, Social organizations and Mutahida
    Qoumi Movement on this fact and due to those agreements they are silent or those
    all are under fear of MQM?\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\tIs it not a national criminality to
    keep silence on these national issues?\r\n9.\tAre Sindhi members in Assemblies
    are acting their role which is assigned to them by people Sindh? If not any assembly
    member asked in public meetings about these facts?\r\n\r\n10.\tWhat are our duties
    and what we have to do in theses situations?\r\n\r\nWhen I am going to end to
    compose this letter I received a valued SMS from my friend as &ldquo;King
    Napoleon was busy in fighting in Poland, some Russian prisoners were brought before
    him. The attitude of those prisoners was humiliating towards the King as they
    said we Russians are far better than you, you fight for wealth and we fight for
    honor. Napoleon reply has been recorded in history as&rdquo; every fight
    for what he doesn't have&rdquo;&rdquo;.
    \r\nThe answers to all these questions and any matters in this regard will be
    appreciated. \r\n\r\nWith Regards \r\nJehangir Rahujo, Advocate HC\r\nPresident

    look (at a minimum) like a lot of the \"massive anti-taliban operation\" is a
    scam. For example, the army is busy showing video of artillery fire all the time.
    When was the last time the Indian army used heavy artillery in Kashmir? but it
    looks great on video and the goras are buying it big time. similarly, they claim
    massive body counts, but never show any bodies. And the media is getting threats
    and the local people are not as convinced as Petraeus seems to be. The whole thing
    is beginning to smell to high heaven. \r\nOf course, the question then is, what
    is the american angle? are they so dumb they are being made fools? probably not.

    admn.  rightly considers that George w Bush,s 8 years are responsible for USA's
    present woes. By same logic, the current mess in Pakistan can qualify as legacy
    of a  parallel years of Musharraf/Military misrule. No sir, Obama admn. thinks
    the civilian Govt. Post Musharraf is responsible for everything going bad. It
    seems clear which direction US policy is taking. No need for conspiracy theory
    there.\r\n\r\n\"After eight years of George W. Bush, the one lesson the Americans
    had appeared to learn when it comes to Pakistan is that the only viable option
    here for long-term change for the better is the civilian one. And yet, having
    vowed to learn from President Bush's mistakes, the new American
    set-up is sending out devastating signals against the civilian government and
    drumming up the 'safe' option of the Pakistan
    Army. \r\n\r\nWhatever the PPP-led federal government's sins
    of omission and commission, it must not be forgotten that it has been in power
    for little over a year and, on the militancy issue, is working in a fractious
    political climate and with little real control over the country's
    national security policy. American impatience will only aggravate its problems.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-blow-to-the-government-hs-01"

    \r\n\r\nFrom Steve Walt's Foreign Policy blog:\r\n\"According to Khuram Iqbal,
    the Pakistani Taliban have failed to gain popular support, and show no signs of
    becoming an effective mass movement (akin to Hezbollah in Lebanon). Instead, they
    are increasingly seen as a narrower terrorist group, reinforced their unpopularity.
    While they remain a problem to be dealt with, fears that the Pakistani state was
    on the verge of collapse or that the entire country might be \"Talibanized\" seem
    to have been greatly overblown. (Juan Cole: take a bow).\""

<p><b>I.</b> </p>
<p>Dear NYT editorial page,</p>
<p>Let's talk. </p>
<p>I know you are really into this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27mon1.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all"> ____ miles from Islamabad</a> schtick. It is a good schtick. Mainly because your dwindling readership cannot actually place Islamabad on a map. Nor do they have any sense of its physicality. Can you name a prominent landmark in Islamabad? Do you know what the terrain looks like? Precisely because it is an indeterminate space, you can project on it the Mothra Flies Towards Tokyo scenario that seems to be moving so much copy lately.<br />
<!--more--><br />
You begin your editorial with a telling sentence:</p>
<p>"If the Indian Army advanced within 60 miles of Islamabad, you can bet Pakistan's army would be fully mobilized and defending the country in pitched battles." </p>
<p>I bet your readers would know that India has a standing army of nearly 1.2 million. If even half of those were to show up in Pakistan, it would indeed be the Game Over scenario with which you begin. Ok, we are now talking doomsday. What's next? </p>
<p>"Yet when the Taliban got that close to the capital on Friday, pushing into the key district of Buner, Pakistani authorities sent only several hundred poorly equipped and underpaid constabulary forces." </p>
<p>Oh, man! the "Taliban"! I guess reading those two sentences together we are to assume that the "Taliban" are 1. A country's army and 2. HUGE. Maybe 1.2 million huge! So you are absolutely right that some several hundred poor old constables (constables!) are gonna get crushed.</p>
<p>How is it that the "Taliban" which are only estimated to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/20/ST2008092000530.html">10,000 to 15,000</a> <i>in Afghanistan</i> became a million strong in Pakistan? Oh, I know. It is because Pakistan is a nuclear state. And when the small Talibaby crawled over the Durand Line, it was exposed to the shameful rays generated by the nuclear test. And it became TALIBOTHRA! Huge! And now it Flies Towards Islamabad. </p>
<p>Clearly the dumb-as-bricks "most Pakistanis" "do not fully understand the mortal threat" of the TALIBOTHRA. How could they? It isn't like they have played host to these millions of Afghan refugees since 1979. It isn't like their army was explicitly told and funded to train and equip them for over a decade. No, "most Pakistanis" know less about TALIBOTHRA then the editorial staff of New York Times. And it knows best. </p>
<p>What it knows not is that the TALIBOTHRA in Pakistan (after the nuclear rays) amounts to <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/17868/profile_of_tehrikitaliban_pakistan.html">10,000 or so</a> fighters. The standing Pakistani army is over half a million. That's sheer numbers. 10,000 against 500,000 makes no sense outside of Zack Snyder's feverish imagination (and he'd be rooting for the 10k, just saying). </p>
<p>So, why so afraid NYT? What's really bothering you? Is it that there is a civilian government cutting deals with religious nuts? Is that the problem? Does the history of that region's constitutional freedoms mean nothing to you? And if your argument is that the human rights violations are too fundamentally egregious, is a military assault and a guerilla war amid civilian populations, your only recommendation? But, that's not really your concern, is it, dear NYT editorial page. Don't be shy, just say it:</p>
<p>"And &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; most frightening of all &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; if the army cannot or will not defend its own territory against the militants, how can anyone be sure it will protect Pakistan's 60 or so nuclear weapons?"</p>
<p>Ah, the weapons, the weapons. They need to be protected. Do I detect a hint of contradiction here? I mean, how can you trust General Kayani to protect the weapons if you cannot trust him to fight TALIBOTHRA? Tsk. I think you missed a real chance in your conclusion there. Instead of the weak-chinned "oh-we-have-two-bills-on-the-hill" shite, you'd have been the real America-Fuck-Yeah!, you should have asked for an outright invasion of Pakistan. Only the American Force can protect the nukes, put the "weak civilian leaders" in their place, and take out TALIBOTHRA! </p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Dear Hanif,</p>
<p>It is always good to read you <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/24/AR2009042402315_pf.html">in print</a>. I am delighted to see that you have managed to coordinate your op-ed so nicely with the Zeitgeist (including the quaint "constabulary force" though, your TALIBOTHRA is ten miles further out). However, is it really the case that your city of 18 million (Karachi, that is) will fall? Or do you think Lahore (pop. 12 million) will fall? You go on and on about the closed girls schools (they have <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/schools_reopen.html">reopened</a>) and the out of work barbers and all, you nonchalantly dismiss every bit of evidence <i> against</i> your own alarmist thesis. Allow me to string those pearls:</p>
<p><i>Sure, thousands have turned up at anti-Taliban rallies</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, the Taliban routinely place near the bottom of opinion polls, and in elections they garner less than 10 percent of the vote.</i></p>
<p>I am no Taliban-supporter, neither do I wish to see the civilians suffer under their tyranny. But, I must ask you, how is it that you can write 1500 words on the TALIBOTHRA but nothing on the political and military frameworks needed to discuss the future of Pakistan. Is the fact that the TALIBOTHRA can cause civil distress in Sialkot by sending a letter more pertinent than the state's inability to provide basic security to its people? If the people's will is exhausted (I guess besides the thousands in the streets) then why is the army's will exhausted? You, of all people, possess the insights to render those complexities for the audience of the <i>WaPo</i>. You could have also cited a couple of "typical middle-class liberal Pakistani" in your piece? Surely they exist out there in the 160 million strong? Not even a couple? But, you say that your nation is "preparing to surrender". Fine. Walk me through that. Tell me what it means. Will it be like when General Zod makes the President of United States bow to him? (I don't have the patience to photoshop a Taliban head onto Zod's body but I hope you have seen Superman II) But, seriously. What do you mean when you say your nation will surrender. How do you square that with the fact that 1. Taliban are very small band 2. They are an ethnic group already at contretemps with the vast majority of the population  3. There is a functioning state in front of them. </p>
<p>So, given that you are expressing concerns about a gun-powered revolution, how do you actually see this playing out? Because all you cite are _cultural_markers. Will the hundreds of thousands of army personnel disappear? Will the political parties disappear? What will happen. Help me understand your existential threat. </p>
<p>Because the only thing I see your oped doing is contributing to the hysteria that is sweeping this here nation. Read the comments on your op-ed. Tell me what can you say to the incessant hate generated against Pakistanis and Muslims. Do you not bear responsibility for that? You may say: oh, but I am saying what I see. Which is exactly why I ask you: tell me what you see. Where and how do you see TALIBOTHRA taking over Pakistan. </p>
<p>Now, if you'd like to have a discussion about the religious conservatism in the middle class, we can have that discussion. It is a valid discussion. And it speaks directly towards the inherent contradiction at the heart of the Pakistan project (an Islamic Republic of Pakistan, after all). I am happy to speak about how we can promote secular, humanist values to counter the ill-effects of sunnification rampant since Zia. But, I cannot grant you that TALIBOTHRA = religious conservatism. That is the type of bullshit analogy that serves no other purpose than to demonize. You can read my earlier piece in this series to get a sense of where I am coming from.</p>
<p>I await your response.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>For a less jaundiced reading of this "mysterious hysteria", I urge you to read Juan Cole's <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2009/04/readers-have-written-me-asking-what-i.html">Pakistan Crisis and Social Statistics</a>.</p>
