  content: It wasn't worse for me than how he's been with Poor Jemima over the last
    couple of years. The only good thing about the divorce was that it happened amicably.
    Why wouldn't it be. What was left with Imran Khan to do anything about it? But
    I, like all others, wished they could have stayed longer than this. But, it's
    certainly not good to see your heroes loosing - ever.

  content: If i ever wished divorce for anyone it was Benazir Bhutto, not  for the
    reason that you think but just because it's good for her and for the people of
    pakistan. And for some reason i always thought that Imran and Jamima were the
    perfect couple.......................how can someone be so wrong.

  content: Imran is an honourable man and remains always. He is every young man's
    hero and personally i had learnet a lot of things from him including his style,
    his personality, his life on the whole, these are exams in the life of a hero
    but he will recover them very soon. He must help Pakistani people in politics
    as he had helped Pakistani cricket. My prays will always be with him. I wish that
    i met him face to face and have a dinner with him. I like to spend a lot of time
    with him. He is a true legend. I like him very much.

    Imran is the greatest all rounder.  He has an aura and is charming.  He knows his game and he knows exactly what he has to do with his life.  It's good that Jemima and he lived happily this long, and very sensible that they amicably call off their marriage.  Two sensible adults.  Hats off to you Imran.
    One wish in life, to meet you in person sometime.  Watched everyumatch of yours, since my childhood

    there are two things one is imran khans personal life and i believe that we are no one to comment on his personal life he has got the vision, he is not a kid that he does'nt knew what marital life and relationship means ....so what his divorce is a totally personally issue i wonder why people react so badly about this...after all he is a man ...secondly he has got his priorities...how u comment on nelson and vinney mandelas' divorce?....so this thing lies with him purely ...obviously divorce is no good but no one take this step for fun or novelty like a person of imran sort especially having kids ...there must be some solid background....secondly i respect him as a greatest pakistani captain...(atleast he took pakistan on the victory stand of world cup ; which no one did...and never indulge himself in match fixing especially in finals :)
    Imran khans contribution in making a cancer hospital is something which can be shown to pakistani leaders and politicians that look this is the job!
    he is a hero was a hero and will remain a hero
    may God give him more strength and patience. amen

  content: imran khan and jamima...belongs to two different culture , norms and values...although
    IK was used to her culture but certainly not an outcome of that british culture...he
    is egoistioc...got lot more  things to do than jamima...and has enjoyed far more
    respect and fame at every stage of his life....he has opted politics to bring
    change in pakistan ..and atleast he is trying to bring change....like gandhi..mandela..and
    many other leaders tried ..including relegious leaders ...his aim is high and
    i believe NOT FAILURE LOW AIM IS A CRIME ...he was criticised many times during
    his professional(cricket) career , later during his cancer hospital project and
    he proved that he is the man of his words...now what ever are the circumstances
    (obviously hard that he took such decision) he has opted politics ...showing that
    he is thinking beyound his individual life and is thinking for coming generations
    of pakistan and future of his country ...we should appreciate him atleast that
    he is not living for his sake only but he has rendered his life for people and
    such persons comes once in a blue moon. Hats off 4 the great Khan....and  for
    jamima i believe she can find a suitable partner for her life if not hugh grant

  content: Imran and Jemmima made a beautiful couple , but it was not meant to be
    . To be honest with you know one even knew her untill she got married to Imran
    . She got  all her fame by marrying Imran . Imran would have been better off marrying
    an asian girl rather than marrying a white girl . I think Imran khan was and is
    the man of every womens dreams . Jemmima humiliated imran whith thoose disgusting
    pictures with  grant .No matter what happens a white woman will never stick with
    an asian man  good luck imran .

  content: If anything, I think that it's completely Imran's fault.  The woman changed
    her name, her religion, and gave up a fairly fantastic life for his sake, but
    he became obssessed with his political ambitions and effectively relegated her
    to the back-seat.  They'd had an amicable unofficial separation for quite a while
    at that point, so I think that if anything, they were both aware of the the fact
    that things between them weren't going to work out.  I fail to see how a picture
    of two people hanging out is "disgusting", but I think it's also important to
    realise that the blame be placed appropriately.

  content: No doubt he was a great cricketr and one of the best Captains. But I think
    Imran is not just a very greedy person but also a corrupted one at heart. His
    each step is calculated and pre-planned just to bring fortune and good reputation
    just for himself. He cares about no one else. I cannot even imagine how low a
    person can become for the sake of power and fame. I am pretty much sure worse
    is gonna happen to him. One day he will be exposed. Mark my words.

  content: "Well I agree with some of the comments above, Imran was the 'Perfect Hero'
    for me, who stood up to the authorities and aristocracy of the UK during the ball
    tampering affair to claim a beautiful convert to Islam.  This for me was the ultimate
    victory a victory they could both rejoice in on  getting on that 'highway to heaven',
    a victory for Allah!!!\r\n\r\nHowever as the Shaytan would have it 10 years into
    the marriage often the hardest term for any marriage Imran's goal setting continued
    in his lust for more vanity in the form of political power!!!!  What could be
    more detrimental to sacrafice a decent peaceful family life and happy marriage
    for such fruitless causes!!!!\r\n\r\nMaybe I am to blame like the many masses
    that put this guy on a pedlestool like some demigod.  Maybe I and many others
    failed to see through the imperfections of this 'Perfect of heroe's'.  The person
    I am most dissapointed at is Imran for divorce in my beleif is the biggest loss
    any man or any sports man can go through!!! In the eyes of Allah it is truly back
    to the doledrums and darkness to death, misguided by a life lost, for a vain lust
    for 'Power'. Wasn't his legendry status as a cricketer enough?  Hell no his talents
    reached far beyoned his wildest dreams more so than many an average man's acheivements,
    for Allah knows and Allah is the best of all planners!!!!\r\n\r\nI now know not
    to idolise mere mortals from priviledged or none priveledged backgrounds we are
    all equal in Allah's eyes and will receive the appropriate tests according to
    our deeds.  I will never be fooled again!!!  Allah hu akbar\r\n\r\nI really hope
    Imran and Jemimma and their children find the right path in Allah for we know
    only Allah can help them now!"

  content: Indeed its sad to see the near perfect couple getting separated. They had
    a good nine years of marriage and suddenly had to quit each other with mutual
    understanding? Either of them could have sacrified for living together. The separation
    keeps the life of their children at stake. Imran has a daughter from his first
    marriage and now children from second marriage are facing the trauma. May Allah
    bless all of them and shower happiness on them...!!!!

<p><img src="/images/imran.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>If I had one superhero, one legend, in my youth it was the amazing <a href="http://usa.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PLAYERS/PAK/I/IMRAN_KHAN_07001383/">Imran Khan</a>- Captain of Pakistan Cricket Team through late 80s. I remember that poster in Aamir's room of Imran's bowling action and how I tried oh-so-sadly to emulate that. Got my ass kicked.<br />
Imran Khan cemented his legend by leading Pakistan to World Cup victory in 1992. He retired and got married to Sir James Goldsmith's socialite daughter <a href="http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/jemimakhan/">Jemima</a>. She moved to Lahore and <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~islam/thelot/time4.htm">converted to Islam</a>. He started on an ambitious project to build the first free <a href="http://www.shaukatkhanum.org.pk/">Cancer Research Hospital</a> in Pakistan. After that, he entered the political scene by launching his own party, <i><a href="http://www.insaf.org.pk/">Tehrik i Insaf</i></a>, based on a platform of social justice.<br />
He was not that successful. You cannot break into the oligarchy of military elite and landed elite, no matter how popular you are. And he never won a seat until 2002. His political compromises robbed him of his character-based appeal to the public. Jemima's faith was an issue as was his children's faith (and names).<br />
His divorce, at least in London, is being written as the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/story.jsp?story=535572">incompatability of East and West</a>. Hogwash. I believe him when he says that his <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=534276">political ambitions</a> left him with little time for else. Or maybe it was his <a href="http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9973042%255E13780,00.html">playboy</a> past? I haven't really seen how the Pakistani press is dealing with the story yet ...<br />
Regardless, it is sad to see one's heroes proven mortal. Mais c'est la vie, non?</p>
