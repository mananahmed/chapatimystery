    \r\n\"The Ara&acirc;&euro;&trade;ain community put out a History (Tari&acirc;&euro;&trade;kh-i
    Ara&acirc;&euro;&trade;ain) in 1963:\r\n\r\nHistory: The Ara&acirc;&euro;&trade;ains
    are descendants of a tribe from Jericho (in present day Palestine). They came
    to India in the army of Muhammad b. Qasim in early 8th century. In fact, it was
    their bravery that won the day for MbQ as the rest of the Arab army could never
    have handled the ferocity of the Sindhi defense. After the conquest, the tribe
    settled in southern Punjab and Sindh region.\r\nSub casts: Sheikh (arabic word
    meaning elder), Shah, Mula, Malik, Mahr, Mian, Chaudhri.\r\nQualities: Ara&acirc;&euro;&trade;ains
    are hardworking, honest, non-competitive, do not give their daughters to other
    clans or accept dowry, genial. They never ask for handouts, never participate
    in fraud or illegal activity [the history lists from Henry Burton's 1854 report
    Thughee in Punjab to show that Ara'ains are not present]. They are Arabs! \r\nThe
    history goes on to enumerate the great members and families of the clan and their
    participation in the Independence movement and so on. \r\n\r\nJust as same, there
    are other communities that set out their histories, often in contention with each
    other. In present day Lahore, neighbors know each others clan affiliations, marriages
    are settled often times in accordance with, or at the very least the knowledge
    of, the respective communities. &ldquo;Oh, he is a Malik&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    is enough to introduce a thumbnail sketch of a person&acirc;&euro;&trade;s character,
    likely occupation. \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming desire for pride and prejudice arising
    out of one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s community tends to cloud any conversation on this
    subject among Pakistanis. After all, one of the things that sets the Pakistanis
    (read Muslims) from the Indians (read Hindus) is that the former do NOT have a
    caste system. So, while the exultation of one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s blood lineage
    is good, one does not want appear as if our society is stratified and calcified
    by birth stations. And the point is largely accurate, there are no strict rules
    over intermarriages, co-mingling, or co-habitations among the different communities
    in Pakistan. Just preferences.\""

    \r\n\r\n\"Nationalism needs heroes. It constructs for them elaborate mythologies.
    It nurtures, protects, and propagates those mythologies through all channels available
    to it. Examples can be stated from any given nation-state and let me highlight
    three that are directly relevant to my topic: the history and memory of Charlemagne
    in France, Shiva Ji in India, and Chinghiz Khan in Mongolia are all examples of
    heroes that represent some unique facet of that nation&acirc;&euro;&trade;s foundational
    myth. Their mythologies, narratives and histories are not only produced for mass-consumption
    but also jealously guarded in the sites of memory (as Pierre Nora puts it).\r\n\r\nMuhammad
    b. Qasim al-Thaqafi is one such jealously guarded national hero. In the Pakistani
    national history, he is the founder of a Pakistani state in the eighth century.
    He is a devout Muslim, a dutiful commander and a paragon of a true soldier. His
    every step is taken to further the cause of Islam and the Caliph. He is brave,
    fair and just and he takes as his ultimate duty the establishment of the Islamic
    empire in al-Hind. Against all odds and with a small army, he vanquishes the despot
    Raja Dah&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&circ;žr of al-Sind. His triumph
    complete, he returns to Iraq and falls victim to political treachery. There are
    competing narratives that cast him as a temple-burning, usurper and invader who
    establishes the rule of violent upheavel and colonialism in al-Sind and al-Hind.
    Still others seek in him a gentle warrior of the soul that epitomizes the Sufi-Soldier
    duality. These various narratives are fluid, they emerge from competing political
    and cultural spheres. My goal is to contextualize and analyze them. Simply stated.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, one arguement is that underneath all those &ldquo;representations&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    is a &ldquo;true&acirc;&euro;\x9D Muhammad b. Qasim and it is the
    job of the historian to unearth him. After all, where would we be without the
    Truth? Reading my dissertation, I guess. I make no attempt to collate/collapse
    all extant sources to take out the &ldquo;kernel of truth&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    buried in there. My interest is in the production and receptions of these histories.
    With very few sources, fewer external ones, where can I find the truth, even if
    I had the intention? Are the earliest sources the most accurate? What if the earliest
    sources considered al-Sind to be a god-forsaken land and felt that the Muslim
    campaign there had not amounted to much? Muslim chroniclers spilled much ink on
    the sexy conquest of Sham and Fars (with attending heroes) and little on al-Sind
    (with a much more ambivalent hero).\r\n... \r\nWhy was he send there? al-Baladhuri
    maintains it was to capture some Kharajite rebels who had taken refuge with the
    Raja of al-Sind. The later sources have a far grander story about rescuing maidens
    that play a significant role in the present-day mythology of MbQ. Also, al-Hind
    held a curious fascination for the earliest Muslim expansionist. Missions were
    sent here as early as &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Umar b. al-Khattab and &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Uthman
    b. &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Affan. They were not successful but the tales of magical/golden
    al-Hind kept the interest alive. Further still, was the military imperative to
    keep the flanks covered after the conquest of Fars. \"\r\n****\r\nAlso see \"Dissertation

    there has been a fair amount of work done by sociologists on what they quaintly
    term as 'social stratification' amongst Indian Muslims. I don't think it would
    correspond to a classical style caste-system but there is a hierarchical ordering.
    More popular works have outlined gaps between the 'ashraf' and 'ajlaf' classes
    and some state govts have moved towards classifying reservations amongst OBC groups
    for Muslims - how much of this is down to political mobilisation and how much
    reflective of social realities I couldn't say with much confidence.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know much about Pakistan, but the work done by colleagues on bonded labour there,
    suggests that some groups like Pakistani Christians form an overwhelming proportion
    of the exploited labour working in sectors like the brick kiln industry; there
    seems to be some overlap perhaps with ethnicity, since the persistence of this
    kind of labour relation these days tends to be confined to where ethnic cleavages
    can be ordered on a class-like system.\r\n\r\nThe Manu-pyramid, is a specific
    and rather brahmminical way of looking at caste imo; post-Srinivas we would probably
    be better off seeing caste society as a set of discrete groups striving competitively
    amongst each other than a continuous hierarchy. I think many Westerners and quite
    a few Muslims, make the mistake of seeing caste relations solely through the latter
    prism. The importance of the Dalit and Brahmin categories, imo, lies not in their
    overlapping in the two systems (the Dalit category I don't think does and is rather
    a complex category that isn't satisfactorily explained by recourses to orthodoxy)
    but in the fact that they are among the few constants in that they form pretty
    much the only two groups that are found in every region where caste society exists.
    Anyway, this is all bit of a diversion from the topic at hand!"

  content: "Re: \"I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think it would correspond to a classical
    style caste-system but there is a hierarchical ordering.\"\r\n\r\nI actually agree
    with this: i.e. completely agree on the hierarchical ordering, but don't think
    it corresponds to the \"classical caste system\" -- although the extent to which
    Hindu populations correspond to \"a classical style caste-system\" is itself highly
    questionable.  But IMO the stratification carries a certain intensity of charge
    in the latter case that is not there in the former (a charge of equal intensity
    might well be present in other contexts where Muslims are concerned, but not,
    I would argue, in this particular context).  \r\n\r\nOK, will stop with the diversion
    :-)"

    1959, India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s high commissioner in London brought to him an
    invitation from Pundit Nehru to visit India. There Nehru offered him a minister&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    rank at a salary he would himself name with no questions asked about money spent
    or wasted on particle research. Taken unawares, Salam sought time to think it
    over, came back and reported to President Ayub what had transpired. He declined
    a similar offer from Ayub, but agreed to act as his scientific adviser while remaining
    at Imperial College. So he was someone who loved his country so much, but his
    country rejected him.\r\n  There is also an angle of communal harmony to his story;
    having earned every degree that he could, setting new records before he was 19,
    Salam&acirc;&euro;&trade;s urge to go for research abroad would have remained
    unfulfilled had Sir Chhotu Ram, Punjab&acirc;&euro;&trade;s revenue minister and
    a benefactor of the rural poor, not arranged a scholarship for him at Cambridge."

<p>A long while ago, I was a Physics major. This was a default setting. My father, an electrical engineer, expected something similar; as did I. In college, we had some inspirational teachers. Bashir Tahir, our Math teacher for example, was particularly somnambulant to all appearances but had a wicked sharp sprint. I know this because he would sleep-walk as close as possible to our very illegal Cricket-on-the-Field proceedings and then bolt at us. His hope was to catch us, make us give up our Student I.D. and then fix up a fine from the Registrar.</p>
<p>Prof. Naseer taught me Physics. We would both get to the college really early in the morning. And despite the healthy fear/loathing inherent in the student/teacher relationship in Desh, we would talk over chai. Usually about Quantum Physics. I was completely enamored with it. I would read biographies of Einstein and Bohr to understand something. Prof. Naseer would often recommend that I also read actual journals/books dealing with quantum physics. I told him that I had tried my best to find secondary material (materials outside of our really, really, and I mean really, bad Physics textbook) but had come up with very little. Here, he said, write to Dr. Abdus Salam.</p>
<p>I knew of him but I didn't know of him. If that makes any sense. I wrote a simple letter, basically stating that I was taking this class which had some Quantum Physics material and it was really interesting and I would like to learn more. I mailed it to the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste. Some time went by. I cannot tell you how much. One day, I came home to a box bearing lots of stamps and obvious signs of tampering. It contained a number of publications from the Center, some papers authored by Dr. Abdus Salam, and a few books. There was a letter. It wished me luck in my pursuit of studies. It offered me more help and guidance, should I need it. It welcomed me with a "Dear Mr." I remember that "Mr." I remember, vividly, the energy I received from that letter, from that package. Some one far, far away, had cared to respond. I remain enthralled by his kindness.</p>
<p>I learned that he came from the same part of southern Punjab as my father. Sahiwal. I wrote him a letter back, telling him of my discovery. And thanking him. I never heard back. I doubt that my letter reached him. I knew that he was considered an outcast to the state of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Some good people are <a href="http://www.kailoola.com/abdussalamdocufilm/home.php">making a documentary</a> on Dr. Abdus Salam - the only Nobel Laureate from Pakistan. They are raising money for it. I urge you to give. His is a story that needs told.</p>
