  content: "hooray; congrats!  if I weren't on the wrong side of the country I'd be
    there for sure.  Do post pictures.\r\n\r\nalso, I second that earlier appeal for
    prints--if they become available, I'm buying.  Though given lapata's subject matter,
    that might require some explanation to my housemates ('why is there a picture
    of ahmedinejad on the kitchen wall?')"

  content: Thanks Sepoy, and thanks Elizabeth! Wish you could be here.  I think I
    will do maybe a limited run of prints. More on that soon. And I'm sure your housemates
    will eventually adjust to having Ajad around the house.

    it here to New York.  Maybe you can tag along as opening act for Socks's book
    tour.

    Maybe I will swing by if I am not immersed in doing  my tax forms before I leave

    knowing it was \"Bollyhood.\" Is it kitsch? Is there a beat up rickshaw outside
    of it?\r\n\r\n\"19th and Mission, definitely come!\"\r\n\r\nThe Mission is ripe
    for discussion on gentrification...\r\n\r\nBut yes, I will try to come. The date
    also works out perfectly."

<p>I have been waiting, patiently and with bated breath, for this moment for a while now. Those close to me can attest that I am not a patient man, so this has been a rather Amir Hamzaish effort on my part.</p>
<p>Lapata is having a show!</p>
<p>Let me state that a bit more emphatically:<br />
