    Well its not because of the two recent losses of Pakistani cricket team to India. Its because of the cartoon. Please confirm the news before publishing it on your web. Because lots of people are reading it.

  content: "Ha ha ha. Well! Amir you did not get his humor.   He had declared
    the obituary of cartoon mania--You shold read his post on looking for comedy in
    the Muslim world. So he will keep posting about that issue but in a comic way.  Good
    sense of humor"
