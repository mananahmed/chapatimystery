  content: "I read that earlier today: it's a nasty situation, and farangi is entirely
    in the right.   Isn't this \"now that you all obey the rules, I'll change
    them and cast out unbelievers and troublemakers\" how cults start?"

<p>is still a binding contract. A close friend of CM (farangi) has been going through some rough times lately. He contract was unlawfully terminated by his employers. You can read the sordid details in David Moltz, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/06/edison">So Sue Me</a>, July 6, 2009. You can drop him a line of support here or stevemarlowe at hotmail dot com. He likes those someecards ones. He can also be contacted on FB. I love that man.</p>
