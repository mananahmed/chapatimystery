    due. At least there is an effort to save some languages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNY Times\r\nAugust
    24, 2007, Friday\r\nBy ABBY GOODNOUGH (NYT); National Desk\r\n\r\nHebrew Charter
    School Spurs Florida Church-State Dispute\r\n \r\n\" About 400 students start
    classes at Ben Gamla Charter School in Hollywood, Fla, amid caustic debate over
    whether public school can teach Hebrew without touching Judaism; conflict intensifies
    when Broward County School Board orders Ben Gamla to suspend Hebrew lessons because
    its curriculum referred to Web site that mentioned religion; opponents say it
    is impossible to teach Hebrew outside religious context and that Ben Gamla, billed
    as nation's first Hebrew-English charter school, violates one of its paramount
    legal and political boundaries; supporters of school say it is no different from
    hundreds of others offering dual-language programs; battle parallels one in New
    York over Khalil Gibran International Academy, new public school that will focus
    on Arabic language and culture; those who have followed situation say Ben Gamla
    could prove more problematic because, as charter school, it receives public money
    but is subject to less oversight.\""

  content: "I suppose it's a measure of my foolish optimism about human nature that
    I am disgusted by what Pipes wrote about the Gibran  Academy.  So learning Arabic
    promotes an \"Islamic\" worldview?  Absurd, absurd linguistic determinism.  How
    fortunate that we have men like Pipes - a self-proclaimed speaker of Arabic who
    manfully resisted the brainwashing so that he might warn us all.\r\n\r\nHeavens,
    they might try teaching Spanish in schools next.  We all know how speaking Spanish
    trains Johnny and Suzy to favor illegal immigration."

<p>This terror of a language and the official language of terror continues its march of terror - from Raed Jarrar being denied boarding a plane because his tshirt had <a href="http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/2007/08/finally.html">Arabic</a> on it, to Debbie Almontaser resigning because someone printed an 'objectionable' <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/23/AR2007082301933.html">Arabic</a> word on a tshirt </a> to David Al Watan and his six colleagues questioned because a mother heard them speak in <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070901-9999-1m1airline.html">Arabic</a>. </p>
<p>Now that we have eliminated German from the world - and English, and Chinese, and Japanese, and Russian, and Serbo-Croatian-Montenegrin and Persian and Bantu and Afrikaans and French - we are finally in a position to eliminate Arabic as well. </p>
