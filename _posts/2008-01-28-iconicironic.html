The website currently displays only the work that will be in the show; <a href="www.flickr.com/photos/lapata">my Flickr site </a>will continue to display all my pictures.  Some new paintings are not yet posted anywhere, as they will make their debut at the opening on Feb. 7.  For those of you who have been asking about buying paintings or prints of paintings, the price list for the show is posted on the website.  In a couple of weeks I will post information about purchasing signed, high-quality (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giclee">gicl&Atilde;&copy;e</a>), limited edition prints of some of the paintings in the show, for those interested in that option.</p>
