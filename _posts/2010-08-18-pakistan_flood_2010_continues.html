  content: on BBC America today, i briefly heard bits of an interview with a pakistani
    (i believe he was with the government or some organization). he said that pakistanis
    (as if he can speak for all pakistanis) don't want any western interference, and
    that includes any flood aid given (not that that would stop me from giving aid)

  content: "From my office in Hong Kong, I tried to send some aid. So I asked couple
    of my Chinese colleagues separately whether they know any Chinese aid group providing
    aid to Pakistan. One of them said, \"where is the flood? in China?\" I said, \"China's
    friend, Pakistan, is devastated by massive flood and more than quarter of Pakistan
    is under water. So if we can arrange some aid through Chinese aid agency, that
    is great of Pakistan.\" This guy said he was not knowing that. But I felt that
    he really knew because couple of days back, he was browsing some sites in Chinese,
    which were not showing the floods in China. \r\nThe other Chinese refused. Later,
    I found some other source and donated a little sum to Red Cross. Hope that amount
    will reach the needy people.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was indeed appalled by the response
    from my Chinese colleagues. Later, I searched Google to find out the amount Chinese
    Govt provided. It was further disappointing. Richest country in the world having
    an asset of ~ $3 trillion dollars, paid less than $5 millions to its best friend!
    I can't imagine that. For China $10 millions or $50 millions aid is peanut. \r\n\r\nI
    know it is not the time to talk about this to a Pakistani. But I guess, one Pakistani
    should realize this.\r\n\r\nJack"

<p><strong>20 million</strong> people affected. To be "affected" means to somehow be in need of humanitarian assistance because of the flooding. As of Saturday the <strong>official death toll was 1,384, </strong>with 1,680 people reported as injured. <strong>Over 722,000 houses damaged or destroyed</strong>. <strong>6 million people</strong> do not have access to clean water. <strong>3.5 million children</strong> are at risk of contracting deadly water-born diseases, like diarrhea.
