The paintings in question will be mostly South Asia related, with the centerpiece being my series of watercolors of Jackie Kennedy's visit to the Subcontinent. Dedicated CM readers will recognize this series instantly from my old but gold post <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/stardust/i_am_a_horse.html">I am a Horse</a>. These paintings have never before been shown outside of the internet! And to top it all off, the opening will also mark the launch of my new book, <a href="http://www.foxheadbooks.com/?page_id=2">The Little Book of Terror</a>, published by Foxhead Books. The opening starts at 6:30 PM, and the paintings will remain up until February 25th. Farangi and I will both be present. Come one come all!</p>
