    Don't look further than India to negate your theories about electoral politics.
    Personality cult continues merrily with electoral politics, look at the Gandhis
    (Nehru, Indira, Rajiv, Sonia, Rahul... Priyanka has a son and a daughter, Rahul
    is yet to marry, so the future is taken care of). If you think it is only Congress,
    BJP chief Rajnath Singhs son Pankaj Singh contested the UP polls. Personality
    cult reigns supreme, as proved in Gujarat elections by Narendra Modi. Sorry for
    going off topic, but Indians will identify with Pakistans situation. The riot
    scenes are particularly familiar to every Indian."

  content: "here is a purely outsider and speculative take. \r\n\r\nTo the extent
    that modern democracies can never emerge entirely from people's initiatives but
    through struggles between elites and non elites - there is no way we can avoid
    staying tuned into the struggles between sindhi and punjabi elites and other minor
    players like gujaratis and mohajirs and baluchis and so on. Right now, it appears
    that a lot will certainly depend on what emerges from the palace politics of the
    Bhutto family and this will keep resurfacing in Pakistan's journey from time to
    time for at least another decade. \r\n\r\nIt strikes me that the man to watch
    right is not Asif Ali Zardari although he will occupy center stage. The key figure
    really is Mumtaz Ali Bhutto who seems to be scripting alternative scenarios around
    Zulfikr Ali Bhutto Jr. For him, ZAB Jr. is the true heir to Bhutto's legacy both
    in terms of democratic aspirations and in terms of patrilineal continuity.\r\n\r\nHis
    first move was to reconnect with Ghinva Bhutto some months ago, and now immediately
    after Benazir's assassination build on the fact that by custom it fell on ZAB's
    shoulders to lower Benazir into the grave. He is trying to weave all the marginal
    actors in the family into the script he has just managed to arrange a rapprochement
    between Sanam and Ghinva. The idea it would seem is to build a layer of protection
    and mentorship around Zulfikar Ali Bhutto -- with three women of the family --
    sanam, Ghinva and Fatima -- all three of whom dislike Asif Ali Bhutto and probably
    somewhere see Bilawal Zardari as an interloper -- auntly and sisterly affections
    notwithstanding. \r\n\r\nRight now is not the time to openly challenge Asif Ali
    Zardari, he is more dangerous than ever, with enough control over the party mechanisms.
    The trick is to keep the place warm -- gain access to power centers in the party
    without threatening Asif Ali Zardari such that when the time is ripe Zulfikar
    Ali Bhutto Jr. can step in to do the right thing. \r\n\r\nBut what will all this
    mean to democratic aspirations of ordinary people ? How should democratic movements
    relate to these palace intrigues ?  Mumtaz Bhutto is at the end of the day a sardar.
    His instincts powerful as they are and sensible as they may be will always be
    for the internal wrangles of clan politics. Under his tutelage, and through him,
    both Fatima and zAB Jr. will gain access to power but precisely because it is
    through him that they will find themselves trapped into power dynamics very similar
    to those in which Benazir Bhutto found herself when she first became prime minister.
    I hope, I mean really hope that Fatima Ali Bhutto does not get entangled in these
    politics and remains a journalist for another decade. That is the only way someone
    from a family like that can lose their sense of personal entitlements and begin
    to understand the entitlements of ordinary people."

    has been observed that most of these plunderers comprised youth between the ages
    of 13 to 17. These young men were apparently apolitical, but took advantage of
    the situation and further increased tension in the city.\"\r\n\r\nSo where is
    the 'orchestrated' plot?\r\n\r\nThe looting and arson was definitely the worse
    I've seen in all my time in Karachi. But this was not really the result of some
    kind of plot as much of a conscious decision by the military and paramilitary
    forces to delay their deployment in the streets in order not to further inflame
    angry PPP supporters."

    that with Mumtaz and Benazir Bhutto both dead, that maybe it would be wise to
    settle the feud and open up the PPP to new leadership.  It would reduce the payoff
    for assassinating either of them.  This would also open it to addressing some

Benazir's 19 year old son, Bilawal, has been named <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071230/ap_on_re_as/pakistan_261;_ylt=A0WTcVZzv3dH4pAAnyj9xg8F">successor</a> to Pakistan People's Party - to keep the dynastic aspirations intact. And why not? There is no democracy outside of the party, no reason for it to exist within. One can call this a reflection of the feudal structures left untouched by many a pseudo-revolutions; one can point to the long history of the pir/spiritual guide's extension into the political realm; one can blame lack of political education and access to corridors of power for the members of PPP; and one can acknowledge that the military regimes have sufficiently retarded all venues of political legitimacy, such that there simply cannot be any alternatives to the once-future leaders - Bhuttos, Jatois, Bugtis, Sharifs. Whatever the case you wish to make, reality is that "politics" in Pakistan has, and will, remain a hereditary, charismatic domain built around cults of personalities - until and unless electoral politics takes firm roots. </p>
<p>The PPP will contest the elections on Jan 8th, 2008. If they are held.</p>
<p>The American blogosphere seems obsessed with figuring out how she died: see <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/062223.php">TPM</a> and <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/12/29/19275/501/403/427748">Dkos</a>. Someone ought to inform them that there is no reason to even acknowledge official statements on this point. In any event, Dawn News has published <a href="http://epaper.dawn.com/ArticleText.aspx?article=30_12_2007_001_004">photos of the assassin</a> that should end all CSI-ish speculations. </p>
<p><b>update:</b> Which is not to say that the assassination, the hasty removal of evidence, the lack of investigation and the clumsy attempts to hoist the blame onto someone else doesn't have <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/zia.htm">precedence</a> in Pakistan's immediate past.</p>
<p>A dear friend sends chilling words from Karachi:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to let you know that I am alright, incase you are wondering about my well being in view of the current situation in Pakistan.</p>
<p>I would like to say that it is a bad dream but it is not, it is a bitter reality.  I have lived in Karachi for long but never have I seen anything of this magnitude.</p>
<p>The night of December 27 will remain etched in my memory for some time. After hearing the news about Benazir's death we shut down office early that evening and left around 7PM. I was with 4 of my colleagues who lived in the same area.  After dropping one person in Gulshan-e-Iqbal we proceeded towards Gulistan-e-Jauhar (where I live. It was one of the most affected areas in Karachi which was the most violent place that night).  There are 4 entry points to this area, we tried each one by one but were stopped by blaze and angry mobs burning, doing pathrao (stone pelting) and firing.  After turninng away from each entry point, I thought of an alternate last option.  When we reached there we ran into heavy blaze, turned around to go into another direction but after a couple of blocks stopped by another street-end closed by a heavy blaze.  We stopped there just to think about the next step, all of a sudden people started assembling around the fire with batons, glass bottles and other stuff like that.  The next 30 seconds were in slow motion, they were eyeballing us and then all hell broke loose.  They charged throwing all kinds of heavy stuff at the windshield and hitting windows with batons.  My friend started reversing the car and they kept running with the car and attacking.  We went back may be half a block or so and then they stopped, may be we had reached a point after which they didn't want to proceed.  It may have lasted a minute or two but man! it seemed like an eternity.  As soon as they stopped we turned into the first street we saw and stopped to gather our wits.  We spent the next several hours in this unknown street in an stranger's house (who was nice enough to give us refuge till the situiation got better).  I finally got home after about 24 hours.  On my way home last night around 11PM, the city looked liked a ghost town.  Streets and even main roads were covered with broken glass and burnt vehicles were scattered all over the streets.  I have never seen it like this not even under curfew. This was a horrible experience, but it could have been so much worse, they could have shot at us or use petrol bombs which were used that night to torch vehicles.</p>
<p>The faces I saw that night didn't seem like they were from among us, there was blind fury in their eyes, it felt like we were in enemy teritory in another country.  As events have unfolded since December 27 it is definitley not just spontaneous reaction of Benazir's death; it is a well orchestrated move for anarchy and to destabilze the country.  Not all of the news is out, most of the Sindh has been practically razed.  Only in Karachi over 600 vehicles were burnt in less than 24 hours, in addition to this widespread looting and arson took place. Hope things get better soon. </p></blockquote>
<p>Many others have observed that these riots appear to be <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=88492">orchestrated</a>.</p>
<p>Stay safe, my friend. Stay safe.</p>
