  content: for all the shortcomings of india, jnu and the iits are among its brightest
    spots. so many indians have benefitted from their presence. it would be amazing
    to see indian professors in pakistan- maybe a more meaningful and long lasting
    exchange than the rare cricket match.

    Mr. Pervaz has bluntly & beautifully described the current educational infrastructure in pk. i remember my time in Pu, where teachers would ...'choose to dictate from notes they saved from the time when they were students in the same department''... Jamiat used to suppress any sort of 'ghair-mazbi'(they had a long list which also included group discussion with female collegues) activities... Until the new 'General' VC took-over and things got better. The General introduced  STE 'STudent-Teacher Evaluation', which led to suspension of many incompetent faculty members and 'ordered' the directors/deans to update the syllabus, introduce semester system, increase workload/semester and emphasized more on group discussions. It all worked for a while, ...ahhh

    Sepoy: its really funny to hear that you had to go up n down so many times to get that manuscript, You should have visited Pk when i was there and made 'special-arrangements' for you ;)

    Tell me about it. I once tried to get in to the Quaid-e-Azam Library in Lawrence Gardens for some research and had exactly the same experience. It was a long series of interogations by clerks who were more bothered about the chai on their desk getting cold. Even after finally getting in (it took 3 days)  the hassle wasn't over. One of the librarians was constantly standing behind making sure I'm not doing anything wrong. I guess they didn't understand why someone under the age of 40 might want to spend time in the library.

    LUMS is a great place which will definitely go far, especially after having expanded their social sciences department, and starting a law program. The teachers there are great, but (like everywhere in Pakistan) the beauracracy and admin stifles all creative thinking. They have a boogeyman called the "Values and Ethics Committee" that makes important decision, such as making sure no one wears shorts on campus.

    That said though, it has some very inspriring teachers who are committed to advancing the education culture at LUMS and in Pakistan in general.

  content: "I was thinking of doing a law degree from SM Law College in Karachi when
    I came back, and the rigmarole I had to go through was insane.  Not only would
    the school not ever pick up the phone, I was given four different sets of instructions
    by four different individuals (both in person, and over the phone on the rare
    occasions when I got through).  To top it all off, despite the fact that I already
    have a BA from an accredited US university, I was informed that without A-level
    transcripts (of the actual exams, not the schoolwork), I wouldn't be allowed to
    register for anything.  AND, to top it all off, I was also told that until Karachi
    University had \"reviewed and approved [my] transcripts from abroad, to make sure
    they were acceptable\", I would remain in registration limbo.  But they'd be very
    happy to take my money in a non-refundable transaction, as long as I was willing
    to keep on paying them each month (an additional fee).  Bastards.  These are
    the people because of whom I'd rejected my PhD program at U of Chicago; I love
    to teach, but I also do want to live here, and a Lit. degree seemed to be the
    equivalent of career hara-kiri."

  content: Sin; sorry to hear about your ordeal in Karachi. And yes the worst 'part'
    is when they want you to provide an 'equivalence' certificate of A-levels to  normal
    HSC grades. It is really insane and they make you pay like in thousands and issue
    a 'typed' gray paper stating ,''the grades fulfill the HSC standards blah blah''...Similar
    is the situation if you get an ENgineering degree from Abroad and PEC (Pakistan
    Engg. Council) will make sure you regret the fact , why the hell i ever went abroad???
    But 'links' makes the merry go round..i just 'love' this system :)

  content: i do agree that HEC equivalence is really a kick in the butt as i also
    had get one for my o levels and paid twice as i lost my first one. But these equivalence
    are necessary to deal with doctors and engineers that come with degrees from russian
    states and other substandard institutes abroad :). Scheme is right but its implementation
    is certainly wrong. This has always been the real program of Pakistan since decades...
    we make policies but dont know how to execute them.

  content: "I am personally a big fan of Hoodbhoy for his new thoughts in Islam and
    his general views about Pakistan but I could not find much agreeable in his articles
    in which he criticized HEC.\nBecause of my tight schedule I dont have much time
    to comment on each and every point he raised but right now I will comment on the
    following:\n\"One wishes it could be otherwise. It would be a major breakthrough
    if Indian and Iranian teachers could be brought to Pakistan. Indians, in particular,
    would find it much easier to adapt to local ways and customs than others and also
    have smaller salary expectations. The huge pool of strong Indian candidates could
    be used to Pakistan&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s advantage - it
    could pick the best teachers and researchers, and those most likely to make a
    positive impact on the system. In the present mood of rapprochement, it is hard
    to think of a more meaningful confidence building measure\". I was really surprised
    to read that he could not find any \"quality\" Pakistani teachers teaching in
    foreign universities and even in the presence of \"Foreign Faculty Hiring Program\"
    he made his wish about bringing Iranian/Indian and in particular Indians to strengthen
    Pakistan higher education standard. Probably he was trying to be more \"enlightened\"
    as has been the case in some elite sections of our society nowadays that in every
    aspect of life they compare Pakistan with India and portray India and Indians
    as the superpower, whether its film industry, music, IT, language problems or
    even culture.  I am in no way against of comparing Pakistan with India in different
    aspects or praising what India has achieved but we have not. But my point is this
    that we should not present Pakistan as a complete failure and India as complete
    success while comparing the two. As in this case, Hoodbhoy has criticized HEC
    so much that one starts thinking that probably HEC is the main culprit of low
    standard not only in higher education but in every part of life and if HEC is
    kept allowed working in Pakistan then God forbid the higher education system will
    fall to the ground. The problem I guess lies in making the issues generalized.
     The example of Hoodbhoy's generalization is this that \"Pakistan does not
    have a single \"Real\" university\". I guess this is somewhat exaggerated and
    also heartrending that if a person like Hoodbhoy says this. Asia Week had listed
    GIK at 23rd, NUST at 20th and SZABIST on 32nd ranks in Asian Best Universities
    of 2000 in the category of Science and technology. I think Asia Week ranks only
    \"Real\" Universities of Asia not fake universities. Hoodbhoy also mentioned
    India like having the world&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s best standard
    of education and wished to have Indian talent in Pakistan so that they can save
    our education system from drowning. I have no doubt that India has some very good
    institutes so does Pakistan but again we should not generalize while making our
    case against someone/thing. It is really sad and it even destroys the credibility
    of the writer as well.\nI personally have lived and worked in Arab Emirates and
    Saudi Arab (KSA) and have a big circle of Indian friends. I also work for an organization
    (NGO) which is working in education sector not only in Pakistan but in India also
    and I have more hands on knowledge of indian education system. Its not uncommon
    in UAE and KSA that u will hear about the fake degrees of Indian workers, especially
    from Hyderabad. Even Saudis who need a degree for their promotions, ask Indians
    or even go to Indian Heyderabad to \"buy\" a university degree. This is especially
    common in engineering. I asked some of my friends and relatives who live in India
    to send me info about this business of fake institutions and degrees. I also collected
    some of the news in this regard which I have presented at the end of my email.
    I hope u all will find it interesting. I was thinking if God forbid HEC accepts
    Hoodbhoy's recommendations of bringing Indian students/teachers to Pakistan then
    how HEC or Hoodbhoy is going to check or scrutinize the degrees of Indians who
    even have been successful in getting H-1B visas in USA on their fake degrees (see
    the news collections below). In KSA people used to say that if you want an engineering
    degree then go to BAQALA (Arabic of a shop) in Hara (a place in Riyadh) and buy
    it from there. Hhodbhoy was also very quick in giving the examples of Jawaharlal
    Nehru University, and the Indian Institute of Technology, in Delhi and their \"polite\"
    and \"cultured\" students by saying \n\"Angry words are exchanged and polemics
    are issued against the other, but no heads are bashed\". but he failed to looked
    at the dismal condition of  vast numbers of other institutes of India where basing
    the heads is regarded as very common.. Some of the examples I have present below
    under the heading of \"Students Politics in India\". This generalization again
    shows Hoodbhoy's selecting some good samples to reinforce his argument and making
    it universal but forget the opposites. In the end, I would like to say that
    Pakistan has some good things as well as bad and unsatisfactory things (like in
    education) and this phenomenon is universal \"including\" India. But it gives
    a real pain if someone presents just a gloomy picture of Pakistan and contrary
    to that portrays India as superpower. Usually journalists used to do it just to
    earn some money but if our well informed Professor does the same then nobody would
    have the credibility of what they say or write. Now see the other part of the
    picture of \"High\" standard of Indian education and read the following: (keep
    also in mind the fake degrees issue in Pakistan published in the media recently) Fake
    Universities and Degrees in India:\n \n1.Employment consultants take advantage
    of the well-meaning visa applicants as the latter, mostly unqualified, are funneled
    into the US by middlemen who help them with fake academic degrees and pad their
    resumes in order to secure the H-1B visas. These shady recruiters in India take
    several thousand dollars from the ``unqualified dreamer'' to provide him with
    some ``hurry-up'' computer training and an H-1B visa. \n(Times of India 11 April
    2001)\n2. Balendu Shekha Tiwari, who claims to be a classmate of Laloo Prasad
    Yadav from his Patna University days, was arrested for his involvement in fake
    certificate scam. The police team was in Ranchi, following the arrest of two professors
    from RN Jhunjhunwala College, who were provided fake PhD and DLit. \nProfessors
    Indra Bahadur Singh and SS Naikwadi who were given the DLit and PhD certificates
    by Tiwari were accompanied by police to Ranchi. According to the police, Tiwari
    has confessed that he provided fake certificates to the professors.\n(Mid Day.com,
    Dec 30, 2003)\n3. Police raided the Institute of Paramedical Studies and Charitable
    Trust from where tthe fake doctors had obtained the degrees. Having no formal
    medical qualifications, these suspects had been prescribing allopathic medicines
    for the last so many years, playing with the lives of innocent people. There are
    about 40,000 such fake doctors in Delhi.\n(The Tribune September 7, 2003)\n4.
    Around 1,000 candidates selected as ETT teachers have been found to possess fake
    B.Ed degrees. The sources said that the maximum number of fake degrees detected
    in probe were from the universities and institutions based in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
    and Madhya Pradesh. Maximum number of fake degrees were found to be allegedly
    issued by the Bharatiya Shiksha Parishad and Gandhi Hindi Vidhya Peeth both based
    in Uttar Pradesh and Maghad University of Madhya Pradesh. \nThe sources said that
    certain officials of the Maghad University were also alleged to be involved in
    the issuing of fake degrees. They used to send fake verifications of the degrees
    issued with their connivance.\n(The Tribune January 18, 2003)\n5. The local police
    today busted a fake degree racket by arresting two women and a kingpin of the
    gang from an institute running in Mota Singh Market here. A large number of fake
    degrees were seized from the gang. According to the police, the institute had
    been supplying degrees for past about two decades\nThe accused allegedly sold
    a fake degree for Rs 40,000 to Rs 80,000. They had contacts with officials of
    more than 20 universities.\n(The Tribune October 3, 2003)\n6. Recently, seven
    fake degree cases were found in North Maharashtra University in Jalgaon. \"At
    that time, a court directed the state government to find out if there were more
    such cases,\" informs Sawant. \"We asked universities to check, but not much came
    out of that. But this matter needs immediate attention.\" \n(Times of India Dec
    2004)\n7. The medical association demanded immediate action against fake medical
    colleges selling fake degrees in New Delhi, and a mass public awareness campaign
    against quacks to be started by the government at the earliest. \n(Express India
    Oct 3, 2003)\n8. It just requires a fake certificate to get a job in top public
    sector undertakings like National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), State Trading
    Corporation (STC), Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL), Punjab National Bank
    or Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL). Chances are if you get caught by an agency
    and convicted by court, another company will readily employ you. GAIL chief
    manager S B Baruah just got unlucky when he was caught by the Central Bureau of
    Investigation (CBI) for submitting a fake certificate in 1992 to GAIL for the
    job of senior deputy manager in 1992.\nBaruah had submitted a fake Chartered Accountant
    (CA) degree showing that he had passed out from the Institute of Chartered Accountants
    of India in 1978 and his role number was 9838.\n(Mid Day.com Sep 26, 2003)\n9.
    Has anyone realised the damage being done to our human resources by allowing students
    to be cheated by unscrupulous foreign universities which have opened offshore
    campuses in India, asks D.S. Cheema.\n(The Tribune, May 24, 2003)\nThe higher
    education system as reported by Swaminandhan (1994), is suffering from several
    weaknesses in the form of increase in demand, proliferation of substandard institution,
    dilution in quality and standard, failure to maintain academic calender, out-dated
    curriculum, disparities in the quality of education, inadequate resources and
    lack of adequate support for research, and out-dated management system.\nThe rapid
    unplanned flooding of higher education engendering complicated situations is one
    of the reason for indiscipline among students. Universities and colleges are viewed
    largely as public parks or political dens where the students emerge as pressure
    groups.\n(Dr. G.Q. Sheikh, Feb 2001) Students Poilitics in India: Twenty-two
    students of Tiptur-based Kalpatharu Institute of Technology have been admitted
    to various hospitals in the City for treatment of head injuries, which they had
    suffered during a clash between students from northern and southern states. Trouble
    fomented around 9 am on Friday when a group of students barged into the classrooms,
    dragged about 50 North Indian students out and assaulted them with wickets and
    iron rods. The assault was in retaliation to an attack on a South Indian student
    on November 28. According to Mr G R Vijayaswamy, Principal of the Institute, \"It
    all started in the hostel mess when one of the students was assaulted for a trivial
    reason.\n(Deccan Herald, Dec 07, 2003)\nAt least half a dozen students and the
    officer in charge of the University police station were injured in a clash between
    the police and students belonging to the AIDSO on the B R A Bihar University campus
    here.\n(Times News Network, Sep 04, 2002)\nActivists of the Khalsa College Students
    Union (KCSU) and the Chandigarh Students Union (CSU) had clashed and the police
    had to resort to a lathi charge at SGGS Khalsa College, Sector 26. \n(Chandigarh

    agreed that the system sucks in pakistan. Being an Indian i can understand it equally damn well.To get a simple book like Pan BY Knut Hamsun, the clerk and the librarian kept me runnin' around for five days at the prestigious S.N.Sinha library.I gave up when they told me to come again on the sixth day. I became the proud owner of the book a week later. How?
        I entered the stack room, located the book, picked it in my hand, and walked out, as it belonged to me since time immemorial. No one asked, no one gave a damn, no one cared whether i had the authority to take it with me or not.Well, i shamelessly stole it, but yet i think i done a service to the book as atleast a hundred people have now borrowed it from me and read it. And a torn dogeared page is much better than a termite eaten page..

  content: "I understand what Dr. Hoodbhoy is saying because I am a product of the
    Pakistani education system. I have some true and hilarious (sorrowful indeed)
    anecdotes of the teaching methods and miserable standards of teaching that were
    practised in 1950s at Lahore College of Engineering and Technology. I left the
    country at the first opportunity I had. I might be accused of being unpatriotic
    but I didn't want to waste my life there. Life is given to you only once and it
    is sinful to waste it.\nI made a couple of half-hearted attempts to go back and
    teach or work in some research establishment after doing my Ph.D. (with my own
    resources). There was no offer that I could take. But I did realize that the bureaucracy
    was as stiffling as it was when I had left the country, if not worse.\nI was hoping
    that that the situation must have changed. After reading Hoodbhoy's articles,
    I realize that it has surely changed but sadly it has changed for the worse. I
    wrote in a couple of articles that the Muslims were walking backwards with their
    eyes physically looking forward. I hoped some body would tell me I was wrong.\nI
    had been hearing about \"Islamization of Science\" for the past several years
    and was totally befuddled by the concept. Finally, I wrote an article \"What is
    Islamization of Science?\" Now one of the objectives of the HEC is to \"Quranize
    Science.\" Have the HEC planners have lost their minds? Are they living in the
    twenty-first century, or what? The great Islamists of the medieval age like Ghazali
    had condemned science but had not suggested to Islamize it or Quranize it because
    they knew it was impossible.\nFor God's sake, keep religion out of science if
    you want to make any progress in science. Study and practise your religion as
    much as you want but keep it away from science because the two do not mix together.\nWhat
    Pakistan and the Muslim world needs is secularism. Secularism is not necessarily
    godlessness; it is separation of religion from the statecraft (including science). Posted

  content: I am not aware of Pakistani eductaion system, but Indian education system
    is passing through a very bad phase now. If you have compared Indian eductaion
    with any other asian country 15 years ago, I could have provided at least 20 institutes
    which guarantee quality eductaion. Now, shortage of faculty is creating huge  problem.
    The salary provided by Indian/MNCs are much higher than  institutes. If India
    can not find good teachers, how can they provide the same to Pakistan? Cream of
    the Indian brain is going to USA and joining US based MNCs. In my student life,
    we have seen most of the senior professors were from reputed US/EU universities.
    Now, even IITs are not finding good professors. Indian and Chinees are very selfish
    when country matters. We have not added IITs/IIMs/AIIMSs in desired rate. Better
    look towards CUBA,Srilanka. They have better education infrastructure.

    No matter how accurate might be in analysing the problems of Pakistani Education
    sector, he is not right when he implicitly groups \"beard, burqah's and mosques\"
    as problems. These things never stop or hinder in any way honest and vibrant
    environment in universities. Rather these very signs of Islam stimulates an honest
    endevours."

  content: "A few IITs and IIMs, that offer education for just about four thousand
    students of a billion population is not at all indicative of India's Higher Education.
    My friends, let me tell you India is no better than Pakistan. Just 3 per cent
    of graduates who passout from our Universities and Colleges are employable. Barring
    IITs/IIMs and a few Universities, research in Indian universities has taken complete
    backseat. The problems like plagiarism, bureaucracy, rampant corruption and divisive
    politics are all destroying our education system.  If someone tries to bring
    change, he will be shown the door.  Merit is a mere joke in India, if you are
    born in certain communities you can get admission. Education in India is so expensive
    that poor can't even imagine of their children becoming doctors and engineers.
      Basically we are from South Asia or Indian Sub-continent, though we are
    divided by borders, our problems remain the same. There is something wrong in
    the system we live in.  If military rule couldn't bring any change to Pakistan,
    I doubt our non-functional democracy will ever bring a change.  If at all
    any good has happened is last 60 years is not certainly because of govt. but the
    steely resolve of our people of provide better education to children, despite
    of all the economic hardships."

  content: "Dear viswanath,  I agree with you that we are divided by borders
    but our basic problems are the same. But india is still better then pakistan coz
    dispite all the corruptions, bureaucracy and other embazellements that you mentioned,
    india is lucky enought to get consistancy in their political &amp; economic situation.
    There is no major U turn in policies in India. However, You cannot say the same
    thing in case of Pakistn. More then half of our history is based on dictatorship
    which is the biggest threat to democracy, economic stability and investors. It
    is unfortunte to say that the military regiem has destroyed the democracy and
    economic stability of pakistan. Moreover, corrupt politiciens, fudalism, injustice
    are such problems which have further pressed the most pressed people of the world.  Regarding
    comments of Dr.Pervez Hoodbhoy i totally disagree with him. He used to make criticism
    for the sake of criticism and just to get himslef prominent. You know that System
    cannot be changed overnight. I agree that there must be loop holes in the policies
    of HEC but still HEC has brought about revolutionary changes in the are of Higher
    Education of Pakistan. One can see visible change in Higher Education sector.  In
    my opintion consistancy in policies is mendatory for the improvement of any system.
    All the best universities of world like harvard, cambridge, MIT etc are more then
    century old and now they have got the present prestigious status. We should encourge
    the positives and make suggessions for improvements.  Thanks &amp; Regards   Safeer

  content: there is no need to beg INDIA for their teachers to come and teach us.When
    we got independence we had only three trains, one factory and most importently
    just one university.If we compare with india then I would say that we did a lot
    better than them. I have seen many many pakistani are working abroad in excelent
    capacities. In fact we pakistani have the habit to always complain and give negative
    comments we never think posatively.Other than that we must have self confidence
    and try our best to excell in every feild of education.Lastly I would say that
    we have ignored our book QURAN completely although it says million times to think
    and ponder. We being muslims  should be an example for these non-muslims in each
    and every feild of life. I pray for all my muslim brothers and sisters to come
    back to the real root because it is not late yet Ameen

    the minds of students about the'enemy' right from the childhood. At the end of
    the tenth standard,the student forgets about the British rule and becomes a strong
    opponent to the neighbouring country. In India, he becomes suporter of Nehru while
    Jinah becomes a villan . May be opposite in Pakistan.    Why can't we teach

    are arranged like pc workshop. international societies are there in the university.
    the pattern of exams is such that that we cant crammer.teachers daily give us
    assignments .we ourselves make projects. i dont say that pakistan`s universities

    culture and devlopments. I am in IT indistry since last 15 years and in digital
    technology for 15 years. I travelled many  countries and spent a lot of time there. I
    stayed in Korea also for about 2 years and fortunately I had deep study on Pakistan
    through TV channels . My guest house we had Pakistani cooks and interacted
    with them well. My conclusions with reference to education are as below. 1.
    Seperate Islam from Education, Some one has mentioned this above.This thinking
    is curse for Pakistan\\Afganistan may be bangladesh etc. I have seen many pak
    debates linking islam with Science. 2. Delinking Islam with education should
    be done from Nursery  class itself. Pl note that education has nothing to  with
    religion. 3. Pak  as nation ,pl do not be ambassodor of Islam but ambassador
    of modern technology. 4. Please educate your women as they only inclucate a
    child values. 5. DO not discurage a person like homistan.Open eyes to good
    around your country. 6. Your cricket team is true example of your country where
    every player pulls leg of other player. Regarding getting Indian teachers :
    If you pay  to M.Tech guy 15 Lakhs per annum,they will come( provided visa:-))"

  content: "To my Indian &amp; Pakistani friends,  I was a student until a few
    months back when I graduated with a degree in Engineering from a reputed University
    which is ranked just below the IITs. Like many of my fellow friends have stated,
    other than the IITs and select few other Institutes, Indian Universities have
    a lot to work for before they can claim to produce 'educated'  pool of professionals.
    India spends a very small amount of its annual GDP on Education, and I believe
    its about 3% of our total GDP.  Thus, we cannot bask in Pakistan's bleak educational
    reforms if we cannot mend our own backyard.  However, I feel that if Pakistan
    feels the need to get Iranian/ Indian professors/ educationalists to help jump
    start the dying interest in Education, then both sides should be willing to acknowledge
    that both countries only stand to gain by it. Almost all my Indian and pakistani
    brothers will agree with me when I say that we're really the same people. We have
    nearly the same culture, our fashion is almost same, our food is similar ( Yes,
    my Pakistani friends like  spicy food too :-) ), and our way of life is quite
    similar too. So why do we need to compare?  Positive comparison only builds
    trust, friendship and loyalty, all three of which is lacking in India more than
    in Pakistan,  I kid you not when I say I have met some Pakistanis who were so
    good to me  that it could change anyone's idea about Pakistan as a whole. I honestly
    vouch for such people's generosity.  Both countries are developing, and
    maybe India has had some few crowning achievements but that doesn't give us the
    reins to belittle Pakistan.   I honestly pray both countries prosper and
    \ become a beacon of achievement for other countries to look up upon. :)"

  content: "Greetings, folks!  I would like to state an interesting anecdote.
    I graduated from FG Post Graduate College, H-8, in Islamabad in 1994. I was at
    the college until 1997, but thereafter my personal journey and interest took me
    away from Pakistan. I happened to be in Islamabad last year and asked my brother
    to take me to my college as the temptation to see the changes at my den of seven
    years was too great to ignore.   What I saw was shocking and beyond belief,
    to say the least. Nothing had changed in 12 years since I had last visited the
    college as a student. The college building had more or less the same decor inside
    and out, the walls inside the class rooms were a horror show as windows with broken
    glass are just the way I had left more than a decade ago. Most doors can't be
    locked from inside our out. In short, there is not one thing that I would say
    had changed in11 years. It was shocking as it was painful.   Higher education
    is what shapes the careers of future leaders and feeds a country with talent that
    can take the country forward. If this is the state of one of the best colleges
    in Islamabad, then it is very easy to assume that Pakistan is struggling big time.
      I have had the good fortune of attending schools in Pakistan and abroad,
    primarily in Sri Lanka and India, two countries who definitely have a much better
    education system than what we get to see and experience in Pakistan. Make no mistake
    about it!  Government schools, colleges and universities simply suck in
    Pakistan. Things may have improved off lately but it wasn't the case in the 90s
    when I was in college. Had it not been for my time spent in schools in Sri Lanka
    and India, I would have been just another individual walking around with a degree
    from University of the Punjab.  I am sorry to disappoint all those who feel
    highest education is Pakistan is a smash hit. It definitely is not. I say this
    from my own experience. The time I spent in college in Islamabad should have shaped
    my career in some way but obviously it did not. Imagine the plight of students
    who are enrolled at such institutions and who have no idea that most of them would
    be misfits in society since when they are done with their graduation/masters.
    A few of them would break free with a bit of luck and influence, but most of the
    students are staring at a bleak future, unfortunately.   Here's a primer
    of what ails higher education system in Pakistan and what needs to be done (I
    don't remember the name of the author who wrote this but its a job well done by
    the person who completed this thesis):   Problems in Pakistan  (i)
    access was very limited in universities.  (ii) quality was very low in the
    fields of academic, administration, research and equipment.  (iii) faculty
    and staff need development in knowledge and skills.  (iv) funds were provided
    inadequate and misappropriation was common.  (v) character building of the
    students was ignored.  (vi) there was no linkage between university and industry.
     (vii) examination system was faulty.  (viii) good governance was non-existent.
     (ix) private sector was expanding without merit.   Recommendations to
    solve the problems mentioned above:   (i) Enrolment in universities should
    be increased by providing adequate all types of educational facilities.  (ii)
    Quality of faculty, staff, students, library, laboratory, research and equipment
    should be enhanced.  (iii) Development of faculty and staff should be ensured
    through meaningful continuous in-service training.  (iv) Funds for higher education
    should be increased reasonably.  (v) Character building of students should
    be focused.  (vi) Linkage between university and industry should be established.
     (vii) Good governance should be ensured.  (ix) More open universities should
    be established.  (x) New disciplines should be started to meet the need of
    the market.  (xi) Night classes should be started with transport facilities.
     (xii) Summer vacations should be banned.  (xiii) Political activities should
    not be allowed.  (xiv) Rules and regulations should be enforced forcefully.
      Anyone who agrees with these? Am all ears, people!  Good luck!"

  content: 'Well definitely there is a lot of difference between the 2 countries education
    system but there are similarities as well. I would say Indian youth get much more
    opportunities, as basic graduation is cheap. I completed my graduation in 2007
    and the total cost for 3yrs as around Rs.10000. More opportunities mean: after
    graduation we can always join a good BPO like IBM, Genpact,infosys, sutherland,these
    are just a few to name. These BPO''s run a program called EduCareer, under which
    employees can choose from a wide range of Masters degree. The company pays 80%
    of the fees, which is deducted in nominal installments from the salary. After
    completion they can move up the ladder in the same organization or try another
    one.'

  content: "hey howdie everyone!  well i have read every comments and though i
    was not a very good student i can see privatization of the education in India
    is really costing us dearly. my younger brother and sister go to DPS and Amity
    International respectively. while my sis is in class tenth and her monthly fee
    is more than 7,000 rupees my brother is in class 5th in Amity and his monthly
    fee is more than 5,000 rupees. not to forget education has become a lucrative
    business in India and many of my dad's friends are now running their own stupid
    pathetic colleges. our ministers are a bunch of losers. they are busy in proposing
    stupid plans to reform education in India. i have many friends from Pakistan over
    internet and one of them is a student in medical college situated n Kohat (pardon
    me if i am wrong i am quite confused here). well if we have a close look Pakistan
    education is really not that bad and Indian education is not so good. yes there
    is a little difference for sure but our politicians are leaving no stones unturned
    to ruin the education system in India for the sake of goddamn votes. most of the
    schools,(run by the government ) do not have even roofs and those run by the private
    organizations, well they charge so much that many people can not even think of
    sending their children to these schools and sadly it is becoming a common Indian
    thinking that the schools that charge thousand bucks every month are only providing
    good education. god save education in India! do not lament Pakistani brothers
    we are no good!"

    of the indian news paper admit dat if He will remain for few more years india
    will left far behind than Pakistan in PhDs.yah dats the reality.there r  alot
    of high standard universities.QAU ,NUST,FAST,UET,GIK,LUMS,AKU,PU that r rated
    wid world class universities.Two students of PU won Nobel prize H.GOBiND KHORANA(Nobel
    prize in physiology in 1968) n Dr.ABDUS SALAM(Nobel prize in physics in 1979). 
    \           If Pakistani PhDs come back(dat gov. is trying n many of them r back)

    it. if someone wants to get education he gets it by any mean so blaming systems
    is futile. sharing knowledge is that is important. system is made by us so we

  content: "Hi!  I have come across a few comments given on top of the page.
    I agree with Mr. Hameed that any Mr. XYZ passes any remarks on HEC without peoper
    research and generalizes a few examples. Everyone of us know that corruption is
    common in Asia and we all are rowing in a same boat whether India, Pakistan or
    any other Asian country. I am also product of the same paralized system and have
    undergone such torments, many a times in my life, as faced by you people. I think
    weakness is ours that after getting higher education abroad we are not trying
    to mend what is wrong in this system. This is a time for all of us to think."
---
<p><img src="/img/uni-pak.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6">A few years back, we day-dreamed of reforming Education in Pakistan. This was 1998 or 99. Pervez Hoodbhoy had come to Chicago for a talk and we gathered around trying to see light at the end of the nuclear tunnel. We were a diverse bunch; history, physics, economics, anthropology phd-candidates. Most had had their initial schooling in Pakistan and recognized very well the horrendous system. The discussion dwindled after the initial euphoria, when we realized that we were powerless in the face of a military and civil bureaucracy that invited no meddlers. Some of us went to work for Micro$oft, some started teaching and some are writing lame blogs. Except Hoodbhoy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/view6.html">Pervez Hoodbhoy</a> is fiercely smart and dedicated. He currently teaches at the <a href="http://www.qau.edu.pk/">Quaid-i-Azam University</a> in Islamabad - the flagship university of Pakistan. In two installments, he has just written the clearest denouncement of Pakistan's higher education in the highest circulation English daily in Pakistan, <i>Dawn</i>. I cannot urge you more strongly to click <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/01/03/op.htm#1">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/01/04/op.htm#3">here</a> and read. </p>
<p>His message is clear. Pakistan has no framework of higher education that can match up to the rest of the world. The universities are a quagmire of despotic clerks and professors. The PhDs cannot function in the real world. There is no standard of research in the country in hard sciences or social sciences. There are more mosques on campuses than bookstores. Knowledge is passed by rote and memorization in an endless loop from teacher to student to teacher. Teachers do not engage in or tolerate critical thinking. Any old place can slap a university sign on the door and become an accredited institution to qualify for govt. subsidy. JNU? IIT? forget it, we cannot even match Tehran University in a country cut off from the world for 25 years.</p>
<p>Let me tell a small anecdote. Last spring, I walked into the Oriental Collection in Punjab University Library and asked to see the catalogue. After proving my authenticity as a student, I was asked by the clerk to write down the name of the manuscript that I wanted to see. I said, well, I don't know which manuscript I want to see because I don't know what is in your holdings. I was asked to go to the Old Campus and purchase the catalogue. Sure thing. Next day, I came back and had a specific call# or two. I was told to, then, write a petition to the Oriental Librarian requesting permission to see the manuscript. When presented with the petition, she didn't even glance up from her desk and told me to go back to Old Campus and get the petition stamped by the Chair of the Persian Dept. for validation that my research agenda necessitated that manuscript. She also threw in a lecture on my bad English for good measure (this damn yankee accent). I went to see the Chair of the Persian Dept., explained my research, showed him my petition and asked for his assistance in this matter. He let me sit out there for a while before grilling me on why I would want to study such odd things and shouldn't I be making good money as a computer engineer in Houston. Finally, he signed the petition. The next day, I returned to the Oriental Librarian. She did not even LOOK at the petition I was handing out to her, simply stated to the clerk to go get what I wanted. Power play. Anyways, the clerk says to come back the next day and they will pull the manuscripts from the archives. Sure thing. I returned the next day and was given the stack of manuscripts and a desk to work on. </p>
<p>So yeah. bureaucracy sucks. And it has sucked in the <a href="http://www.hec.gov.pk/htmls/second_n.asp">Higher Education Commission</a> which was created to reform and moderize Pakistan's universities. Instead, it got marginalized in union-politics and fear-mongering.</p>
<p>Hoodbhoy has some excellent suggestions. Requiring all graduate applicants to take the GRE; instituting tenure review and administrative review; re-starting student unions on campus; invigorating cultural and social discourse and, most intriguingly, attracting Indian teachers.</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">One wishes it could be otherwise. It would be a major breakthrough if Indian and Iranian teachers could be brought to Pakistan. Indians, in particular, would find it much easier to adapt to local ways and customs than others and also have smaller salary expectations. The huge pool of strong Indian candidates could be used to Pakistan's advantage - it could pick the best teachers and researchers, and those most likely to make a positive impact on the system. In the present mood of rapprochement, it is hard to think of a more meaningful confidence building measure. <img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Couldn't agree more. One of my dream short-term gigs would be at JNU. I am sure there are scholars and researchers in India who would want to try out decadent Pakistan for a few months/years. </p>
<p>There are some bright spots. <a href="http://www.lums.edu.pk/">Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> [LUMS] has attracted foreign capital, foreign teachers and a higher caliber of students by adhering to international standards. It should act as a model just as Hoodbhoy's op-ed should act as a declaration for reforms.</p>
