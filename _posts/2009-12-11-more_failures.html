    Third International Leninism is kind of cute.

  content: "As asked, this is an edited version of my response posted previously on
    FB:\r\n\r\nIn many ways that is a poor article that misunderstands what you wrote
    and the points you made. I think there are legitimate points of difference and
    arguements to be made but Khan doesn't engage in these. Particularly,
    distasteful was the &ldquo;Decent Left&rdquo;-style criticism
    that because you don't indulge in a public display of anguish
    on the atrocities and the extremism of the Pakistani Taliban that you somehow
    support or at best disregard them! I was unaware that the editors of the Nation
    are required to &ldquo;press&rdquo; authors to run through
    a litany on the evils of the Taliban before they are permitted to write on contemporary
    Pakistan! Khan seems to be annoyed that instead of embarking on a moral checklist
    of who is worse and more oppressive, you actually wrote an article that addressed
    the actual practical issue of how likely a take-over of the Pakistani state would
    be. This of course doesn't stop her from launching into setting
    up a series of straw men that are at best a caricature of your original points.
    This is quite evident in the responses made on the issue of democracy (I don't
    know why adjective 'secular' is raised here,
    there is considerable support for democracy, whether there is for a secular one
    is debatable, this seems to be some wish-projection by the author and in anycase
    was not raised in the original article) where some of the responses are simply
    stunning in their wrong-headed simplicity: ambivalence towards politicians and
    contempt for them, doesn't translate into similar feelings
    for democracy as a process and method of governance (Khan should look at India,
    which she seems fond of quoting examples from on other points, where politicians
    are universally reviled and regarded with contempt but where support for democracy
    remains very high); 'unswerving support'
    for sharia looks a bit dubious when one looks at the low percentage of the vote
    that religious parties which have this as one of their main planks have received,
    explanations of the growth of the Taliban hardly undermine any notion of democracy
    given the extreme violence they have had to indulge in &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; after
    all if the population was so supportive and if the major cities were so responsive
    to their message, there would hardly need to be a lengthy bombing campaign would
    there?!\r\n\r\nI was more excited by the promise of some sort of analysis of class
    and the Pakistani Left but this was similarly disappointing. Instead of a serious
    analysis, we are treated to a potted history of Pakistani politics whose main
    purpose seems to be to foist the blame of the demise of an effective Pakistani
    Left onto the liberal Left. Why the Pakistani Left suffered a demise unlike India
    where the Stalinist Left survived is not explained. Why exactly class based politics
    of the Left proved ineffective in the face of 'Islamiscisation'
    is similarly not explained but simply stated as an outcome. Blaming the liberal
    Left, who after all political and class terms were a relatively weak group in
    Pakistan hardly seems credible. A serious analysis would at least have looked
    at the failure of land reform, persistence of feudalism, poor organisational capacity
    of Leftist parties, concentration of industry and the difficulties in expanding
    workerist unions in this sector etc.- not that these arguements are that convincing
    in themselves to me but at least they would have proved a starting point that
    would have been more relevant; the actual history of class based politics and
    the general failure of Leftist politics in Pakistan is a tantalising issue that
    rarely receives much in-depth analysis and Khan's short diatribe
    proves to be no exception. Instead we have a lengthy detour going off into expositions
    about the PPP &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a party which ultimately was heavily dominated
    by propertied classes as one could get, notwithstanding the social activism of
    some of its cadres at the grassroots level and that was about as 'Socialist'
    as Indira Gandhi's Congress (Bhutto's 'Islamic
    Socialism' rather like Congress's earlier
    'Gandhian Socialism' seems more intended
    to avoid class conflict and stabilise class relations rather than bring about
    any genuine social transformation) this would have been more germane. I won't
    even mention the analysis of the Indian Left and Naxalism that we are treated
    to here; whatever the implications of the Naxalite takeover of Nepal (where other
    Marxist parties are in anycase very influential) it seems that Khan seems to be
    labouring under some illusions about the realities of the 'Stalinist
    Left' Left in India and their Maoist counterparts. The incidents
    of Nandigram, Singur, Marchipilangi , Wayanand and countless others are glossed
    over as have the fact that Leftist state govts have all too often become instruments
    in of settler and capitalist lobbies to the detriment of the peasantry (which
    Khan seems to think they are defenders of); one needs to question what is really
    going on when some of these govts have so accepted the neo-liberal paradigm that
    they merit fulsome praise within the pages of The Economist and abase themselves
    in front of dubious corporate groups with links to even more dubious regimes such
    as the Suharto one. Of the Naxalites, only  a partial accuracy can said to have
    been reached as many have degenerated into banditry and criminalisation in their
    old strongholds of Bihar or else entered into dubious political alliances as in
    Bengal; only where they can command the support of the unintegrated adivasi peasantry
    have they any influence left and can they be said to be playing the role that
    Kahn ascribes to them in India. While the Left in India may have been a bulwark
    against religious fundamentalism; on issues of class, social and economic development
    and basic rights, the record is not good and is rapidly deteriorating all the
    time. This is not a model to follow."

  content: "The survey of the history of the Indian left in Khan's article is misguided:
    a more careful engagement with that story shows what Devji might be getting at
    in thinking of the Naxalites and the Pakistani Taliban insurgents as symptoms
    of similar problems.  Khan seems to take \"the Left\" as set in stone -- thus,
    the fact that the Left in West Bengal did secure important and welcome benefits
    for large sections of the peasantry when it came to power; and the fact that there
    is still formally a \"Left\" in power in West Bengal, leads her to ignore the
    transformation/cooptation that has taken place.  The Naxalites are not allied
    to what passes for the Left, they are, at least in part, an outgrowth of the failure
    of the emancipatory promise of the Left (and, more broadly, of social democracy)
    vis-a-vis the marginalized groups they represent.  In any event, I at least understood
    the analogy drawn between the Naxalites and the pakistani Taliban to not be based
    on an identity of tactics or aims, but as illustrative of a claim that the respective
    nation-states were not at risk of being overrun by these insurgencies.  i.e.,
    I had always read Mana's piece(s) as a critique of a certain kind of panic --
    as opposed to a more \"primary\" engagement along the lines of \"what is happening
    in Pakistan\".  Khan suggests that the very act of writing the former, as opposed
    to the latter, is irresponsible, but this is simply bullying by another name (and
    a common -- and stale -- enough rhetorical tactic, whereby one tries to discredit
    the messenger rather than engaging with the message).*\r\n\r\nSomewhat off-topic,
    but the romance epic of valiant trade unionism Khan discusses is hard to recognize
    for some of us.  The piece makes this trade unionism/labor politics (which, btw,
    Khan reflexively equates with a commitment to left politics, without bothering
    to show it) seem more powerful or significant than it, IMO, was.  I share Khan's
    dismay at the progressive impoverishment of labor politics in Pakistan, but the
    real question isn't \"why the collapse?\", but \"why has it always been so feeble?\"\r\n\r\nI
    read the bit on the \"liberal Left's\" ambivalence toward democracy a bit differently
    than Conrad did, although I think I come out of the same rabbit hole.  I imagine
    Khan is referring to the (very many) Pakistani urban elites that one comes across
    who periodically make accommodations with military rule, some rather enthusiastically.
    \ So far I might not disagree with her -- but the problem is in using the term
    \"liberal left\" for this segment of the population.  It does not at all follow
    from the fact that members of certain classes in Pakistan are SOCIALLY liberal,
    that they are politically so as well: the latter is an ideological commitment;
    the former, in the context of Pakistani society, a function of social privilege.
    \ Perhaps \"liberal Left\" is used to link this mindset with that of the Manan
    Ahmeds of the world, but it's shoddy.\r\n\r\n*[What Devji actually said in that
    article was: \"Pakistan's Muslim militants are developing into the analogues of
    Maoist rebels in India, who also take over certain areas and attack government
    forces there to provide an alternative but non-governmental form of order. Managing
    territories within a state without apparently wanting to form a new government
    suggests a privatised and non-political ideal of governance, one that both Indian
    Maoists and Pakistani militants seem to espouse. The task before both governments
    is therefore not to de-politicize but rather bring these groups into the political
    arena, as India did with Nepal's Maoists, ensuring their investment in the state
    by forcing them to take it over.\"  Nowhere does Devji make any value judgment
    about which would be the greater catastrophe, a Taliban takeover or a Naxalite
    one -- he is simply saying that this sort of development represents a new approach
    to politics and statecraft in areas where the state has, failed.  No one is suggesting
    that the manner of the failure, and hence its implications, are the same in Jharkhand
    as in Waziristan.  I don't agree with much Devji says, but to the extent the point
    is that \"corrupting\" or \"coopting\" insurgents (with some concessions on the
    part of the nation-state, falling far short of radical restructuring but presumably
    representing some kind of improvement) by giving them some kind of stake in the
    system is a better idea than only waging war with them, what's so crazy about
    that? ]"

  content: "I went through all the articles mentioned, and I must say I do agree with
    much of Atiya Khan's article. While I do not think that you are a taliban apologizer,
    but your article in \"The Nation\" was weak. The comparison with elections which
    many Pakistanis seem to use is faulty, because there is no genuine left or even
    centrist parties in Pakistan. People's choices range from less right to extreme
    right parties (I say so, because both the PPP and the Sharif group have enough
    connections with the islamists), so any vote actually goes to the right. Besides
    the taliban have shown no interest in elections, as they have enough supporters
    in the senate (like Imran Khan).\r\n\r\nAs far as Mr. Devji's article, it was
    just pathetic. The maoists can by no means be compared to the taliban. Faulty
    as their logic is, the naxalites have been driven by tribal rights and not by
    some dream of a religious or a non religious state.\r\n\r\nI must compliment you
    on your website, it is a wonderful source of information."

  content: "<i>I'm not sure this is wise, but I have to ask: Conrad,
    you refered to the &ldquo;persistence of feudalism.&rdquo;
    Is this a fairly standard description of Pakistani society, and what does feudalism
    mean in this context?</i>\r\n\r\nJonathan &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I must ask, why
    would you not think it wise ;) I should say that I am not any kind of authority
    or knowledgable commentator on Pakistan,  haven't lived there
    or studied it in any depth. My reference to feudalism was simply because it is
    often trotted out as one of the explanations of the lack of development by economists
    and occasionally by some political scientists as one of the reasons behind a failure
    of class-based politics to take root (though this is usually by those with a Leftist
    background). I have no comment on the veracity of these claims but given their
    predominance in the literature I would have expected them to be addressed somehow.
    In the Pakistani context, I understand feudalism to be mainly applicable to Punjab
    and Sindh, it isn't I think necessarily very accurate in describing
    social relations in the countryside in states like Baluchistan or the NWFP which
    are somewhat different (from what I understand). In terms of definition, well
    this is always tricky but I would take it to mean the general failure of land
    reform to break the concentration of land-holdings as well as the social power
    of the zamindari class in these regions; limiting the growth of capitalist agriculture
    and the development of wage labour market in this sector. Again, I would probably
    question the veracity of this, especially since from the literature, the failure
    of Pakistani land reform is always held in contrast to the success of Indian land
    reform; yet from an Indian perspective, the one thing that always strikes most
    students of land reform policies, was its failure and the ability of the landed
    class to get around it. The power of this class was significantly reduced in India
    but imo this happened much later and was due not to land reform but to economic
    changes in the structure of production, the technological changes wrought by the
    Green Revolution and the different role of the cultivating peasantry their political
    influence.\r\n\r\n<i>Somewhat off-topic, but the romance epic of valiant trade
    unionism Khan discusses is hard to recognize for some of us. The piece makes this
    trade unionism/labor politics (which, btw, Khan reflexively equates with a commitment
    to left politics, without bothering to show it) seem more powerful or significant
    than it, IMO, was. I share Khan's dismay at the progressive
    impoverishment of labor politics in Pakistan, but the real question isn't
    &ldquo;why the collapse?&rdquo;, but &ldquo;why
    has it always been so feeble?&rdquo;</i>\r\n\r\nQ, I think this reflects
    the kind of Trotskyist and Fourth Internationalist-type of tradition that Khan
    is a part of. One can see this kind of analysis in several current journals like
    International Socialism and other outlets like the WSWS; quite piercing in their
    critiques of neo-liberalism, they adhere very rigidly to a Marxist-Leninist model
    of political and social change and every workers' struggle
    or episode of labour unrest is heralded as the next great assault that will topple
    the system. To read some of these articles one would think that the revolution
    is just around the corner, if only the intellectual Left and the activists can
    get themselves organised to lead the workers! Needless to say your label of 'romance
    epic' fits this mentality very well imo.\r\n\r\n<i>I read the
    bit on the &ldquo;liberal Left's&rdquo;
    ambivalence toward democracy a bit differently than Conrad did, although I think
    I come out of the same rabbit hole. I imagine Khan is referring to the (very many)

    Perhaps &ldquo;liberal Left&rdquo; is used to link this
    mindset with that of the Manan Ahmeds of the world, but it's
    shoddy.</i>\r\n\r\nI didn't think of it in those terms and
    that is a fair point but I would disagree with you on the interpretation here.
    In the section on the 'Collapse of the Left in Pakistan'
    much of the blame is laid in a round about way on the Leftists who joined the
    National Awami Party and then later the Awami Party and the PPP. Of course, Khan
    is aware enough to note the rather non-Socialist nature of these parties and ascribes
    the failure of the CPP and other leftists in succumbing to either regional nationalism
    (as in Bengal, Baluchistan and NWFP) or falling for the rhetoric of socialism
    in joining the PPP. This was meant to have 'betrayed'
    a supposedly solid foundation that was built up by workers struggles in the 1950s.
    My point of course is that joining these formations themselves indicated the weakness
    of class-based politics and ideology compared to populism and sub-nationalism
    modes of mobilisation and that many leftists would have joined these political
    groups <i>from a position of weakness</i> rather than because they were in a position
    of strength and threw it away. A lot more can be said how the politics of nationalism
    subsumed leftist politics here, perhaps in a similar way to how the politics of
    caste/religion did the same in many parts of India (at least in the north) much
    later; but that merits a detailed and serious discussion of how and why it happened,
    rather than the assertion that it did, which is what is provided.\r\n\r\nAs a
    small post-script, I thought I was hallucinating when I read the (much maligned-
    at least on here LOL!) Tariq Ali's the duel; where he has a
    footnote waxing lyrical about how the 'honour'
    of the left was upheld by a handful of Punjabi socialists who went off to join
    the ak-47 toting Baluch rebels during the 1971 uprising, including Ahmed Rashid
    within their number. But then to flesh it out I cam across this gem that recounts
    some of the exploits of the London Group during this episode; despite the dodgy
    combat record, I don't think I will ever regard Ahmed Rashid
    through the same eyes again PMSL!\r\n\r\nhttp://gmcmissing.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/revisiting-the-che-guevara-like-days-of-baloch-resistance-movement-with-asad-rehman/"

    \ Khan's piece claims that the Taliban and their alleged apologists on the anti-war

    onto the scene of Pakistani politics.  The implicit notion that the current US-led

    is a potential vehicle of such a transformation seems to me a perspective that
    is both confused and dangerous.*   Afghanistan and, increasingly, Pakistan are
    sites of imperial military and political domination.  One can debate the balance
    of geopolitical, economic, retributive, and ideological motivations or causes
    behind this new imperial occupation, but one can hardly deny its existence.  \r\n\r\n*[This

  content: "Re: \"Is this a fairly standard description of Pakistani society...\"\r\n\r\nJonathan:
    one other thing to keep in mind -- whatever the current state of academic discourses
    on \"feudalism\" -- is that this is a very common, VERY common term in Pakistani
    political discourse in English.  I submit that one couldn't go a week reading
    the Pakistani English press (perhaps even the Urdu press) without coming across
    the term \"feudal\" (or the Urdu equivalent using words constructed from \"zamindar\"
    and \"wadera\" (loosely \"landlord\", in the seigneurial sense).  i.e. in discourse
    within Pakistan this word has a very definite valence (although not meaning),
    and refers to the general complex of agricultural wealth concentrated in the hands
    of a few landlords; and is also used as a general bugbear by many in urban Pakistan
    (i.e. not only in the sense of the \"wicked and exploitative landlord\" but also
    as a means to deny agency to Pakistan's peasantry (\"voting doesn't matter as
    they only vote where the landlord tells them to\")) -- i.e. it has BOTH an emancipatory
    and an anti-democratic potential IMO.  Thus my reaction to \"feudal\" if I heard
    it within Pakistan or from \"within\" that country's discourse would be quite
    different from my reaction if I heard it in the sort of context you mention.  You'll
    hear and read \"feudal\" more often in Pakistan than you'll ever hear \"left\"
    or \"right\" IMO..."

  content: "Re: \"...where it often doubles for 'patriarchal'
    as well...\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat off-topic: As with the sub-continent (and perhaps
    post-colonial societies) more generally, the usage of \"feudal\" in Pakistani
    is a variant of a rather long tradition that posits the distinction between \"city
    dweller\" and \"villager\" as crucial, mapping as it does onto the citizen vs.
    \"mere\" subject distinction.  The \"feudal\" in urban Pakistani lore is not only
    the (monstrous) other of the \"enlightened\" city dweller, but his existence continually
    justifies the (potentially despotic) intervention of the city dweller and \"his\"
    law/state/etc. (one sees this as a rather common trope in Indian films as well,
    whether it is \"Sholay\" (1975) or \"Swades\" (2003); Ray's outstanding \"Days
    and Nights in the Forest\" (1969? 70?) problematizes the whole mindset, but perhaps
    insufficiently so when it comes to the ultimate \"outsider\" of the \"tribal\"
    woman (played, distressingly, by Simi Garewal in blackface)).  It is interesting
    to note that the exploitative \"feudal\" that was a staple of Pakistani television
    serials for a very long time first arose around the time of the PPP government's
    deposition by Zia-ul-Haq (the PPP, of course, was the party associated with \"socialist\"
    rhetoric and Sindhi \"feudals\" by its opponents).  The \"feudal\" in these serials
    could be a romanticized figure representing anti-modernity (\"Waaris\" (1979-1980));
    a stifling symbol of the patriarchal order oppressing women (\"Pyaas\" (late 1980s);
    or a kind of gangster (\"Nange Paon\"; late '90s), but he was always an authoritarian
    and despotic figure, unlike his urban cousin.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is plain and
    simple wish fulfillment and projection too, also along rather old and stale orientalist
    lines too.  Thus, a rather large number of the stories that urban Pakistanis repeat
    about \"feudals\" turn on lurid sexual privilege (i.e. the ability of \"feudals\"
    to simply appropriate women from their villages, etc.); I don't think one needs
    to downplay the persistence of abuse against women in rural Pakistan to recognize
    that these sorts of stories point to the envious fantasies of those who might
    very much like to appropriate whoever they can, but alas will never be able to."

    to be directed primarily at the student Left based in American campuses,  the

  content: "Now we are getting to the heart of the matter, and I think, the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nConrad
    writes, \"If it is indeed the former which is Khan's primary
    intended audience, I am unsure as to the effectiveness of such an approach; given
    that this sector hasn't had a decisive or even significant
    impact on US foreign policy since the end of the Vietnam war.\"\r\n\r\nConrad
    is undoubtedly correct that the student Left has been impotence since the '60s
    (even its protest of the Vietnam war were circumscribed, lest we forget it took
    9 years and many thousands of lives for the war to be fought to the bitter end).
    However, this does not obviate the claim that it could, perhaps must, revive itself
    to transform the current geopolitical situation by acting as a driving force for
    internationalism. The response over U.S. military intervention voiced by the Left
    both in the U.S. and abroad writes off the possibility of any long-lasting transformation
    in America itself. These views are implicitly self-defeating, unless one wants
    to protest military interventions for the same reasons continuously through the
    \ next centuries.\r\n\r\nRevivifying an international Left undoubtedly implies,
    as you say, a great deal of hard work. I do not think Khan's article suggests
    that this is not the case, or that she herself is not endorsing it. Rather, it
    seems to me that she is suggesting that one of the obstacles to this broader,
    practical project is the widespread opinion that Pakistan (and the rest of the
    world) is better off left alone. This view, coupled with the allergy to any practical
    suggestion to substantively transform the U.S. government by Left-wing politics,
    is implicitly nationalist in frame. The \"Leftists\" from the U.S. are reduced
    to fringe crankiness, which basically accepts the current state of things as it
    is. \r\n\r\nThis view, in my opinion, is irresponsible; I do not think the situation
    is bad because of a few short-sighted military adventures by the U.S. government,
    but because this is taking place in regions that are mired in abject poverty.
    There is a broader question, that of changing the dynamics of capitalist development
    and challenging that dynamic entirely, that is implicitly shelved by exclusive
    focus on the actions of the U.S. military. There are some who don't care for this
    question, and that's fine-- except for the fact that the people who don't care
    for the critique of capitalism care little for the political conditions in most
    of the world, either. The two go hand in hand, which is I believe Khan is referring
    to by the term \"undigested Stalinism\"--a sort of Left-tinted-real-politik that
    isn't working for anyone, yet is considered by many to be the ultimate responsibility
    of progressives everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis will not do. If there is to be a Left
    anywhere, it would be an international Left; by extension, it seems as though
    Leftists must take responsibility for the situation in Pakistan just as it should
    in U.S. This, in my opinion, could only take place if the Left reorients itself
    around international emancipatory and social-democratic aims, which have long
    been shelved by the nicely academicized anti-imperialism bequeathed by the New
    Left and left dangling mid-air long after it ceased to point towards a qualitatively
    better world."

  content: "Greg - I have some sympathy with what you are saying. My point simply
    is twofold: I don't think much is being accomplished in this case by the kind
    of military action that is taking place. US military action takes place for a
    number of reasons and according to its own internal logic; improving the prospects
    of the Left, are far from its stated aims and nor is it likely to be a consequence
    of such actions. So, I don't see why any Leftist should support it (this is besides
    the questions of morality since such actions have and are having a very cost in
    terms of loss of life and suffering).\r\n\r\nSecondly, I do think that political
    developments have to come from within political communities themselves and the
    source for any kind of progressive politics has national origins. Of course those
    similarly inclined can encourage and support such efforts but they cannot substitute
    for them and in the absence of such indigenous developments any external pressure
    will turn out to be counter-productive. It is very important to understand the
    nature and exact realities of societies very different and far removed from one's
    own before advocating any sort of direct intervention there and to understand
    the limitations of such an approach. This holds true for both those on the Left
    as well as the Right."

  content: "1) Sorry but I call it like I see it; tis true that I am not a polite
    person and more than bit of a bastard , apologies if this upset you a lot though.
    \r\n\r\n2) first off, the Annales is a lot more than just Braudel, the original
    founding fathers of the Annales school, Bloch and Febvre, wanted to go beyond
    just look at data of prices, currency and trade, technological changes and the
    structure of agrarian society but also to explore  values, sensibilities and feelings.
    This was what is sometimes termed the 'spirit of the Annales'
    at the time. Secondly, even referring to Braudel to support your arguement, you
    are making a category mistake; while the tri-level division of history that Braudel
    makes relegates the lives of individuals and politics, dismissingly described
    as 'event-based history), to tertiary importance; economic
    and social structures are the mid-level that connect this with the deeper demographic
    and environmental changes that actually cause tectonic shifts in underlying patters.
    Land reform is part of this mid-level change and the way it takes place and occurs
    is of importance, all changes in land ownership cannot simply be equated to one
    another, the differences here have important bearing on the outcomes. To simply
    try and relegate this to the surface level of event-based history, is a category
    mistake and a mis-understanding of Braudel's theory of history.
    I won't go into the swing back to the 'internal
    lives' and mentalities that has characterised more recent developments
    in Annales as through the work of Le Roy Ladurie and Goubert who reacted against
    the environmental long-duree approach of Braudel and his dismissal of 'human
    insects' since this isn't meant to be a
    discussion about historiography, but just to note that equating the Annales school
    with Braudel is a mistake, quite apart from any issues of misinterpreting Braudel's
    approach.\r\n\r\n3) Sorry but where did I say that changes in property ownership
    is not violent, please point that out to me. You seem to be arguing against something
    you think/wish I said, rather than looking at what I actually did. My point was
    the different types of changes in land ownership cannot be equated with each other
    nor can they be subsumed under the category of 'Land reform'
    which is actually quite a specific category. For example, replacing Hindu landlords
    with Muslim landlords is not 'land reform'.
    You seem to be equating all changes in land ownership and land rights with 'land
    reform' which is wrong and seems more to delegitimize land
    reform as a distinct category, rather than any actual empirical evidence. There
    is also a large typology of different types of land reform (whether from 'above'
    or from 'below'; how settlements are worked
    out, what property rights are actually given etc.) what form it actually takes
    has a huge impact on outcomes &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; something that most scholars
    of land reform will tell you. In terms of land reform, several major episodes
    of land reform have been carried out without wholesale violence, though inevitably
    it always involves a measure of coercion; zamindari abolition in India, for example
    through the Zamindari abolition acts in UP and Bihar, did result in a substantial
    transfer of ownership rights from the top level of landowners to the intermediary
    class. There is a massiv literature on this Jannuzi's work
    on Bihar and Wolf Ladejinsky on UP being the classic works by observers present
    on the agrarian scene at the time they were occurring. Incidentally, I would like
    to add that Naxalism was not 'contained'
    by CPI(M) sponsored land reforms, attempts to actually impose land ceilings and
    redistribute land was what led to outbreak of fighting in Naxalbari and the split
    within the party in 67. Naxalism was smashed inside West Bengal because it was
    attacked by the Centre after the declaration of President's
    Rule and use of the army and intercinine fighting with the CPI(M). Upon returning
    to power in 77 the Left Front govt quietly shelved plans to impose land ceilings
    and agricultural taxation, what was done was the registration of sharecroppers
    and the enforcement of harvest contracts that guaranteed them a fixed share of
    the output. This benefited the middle peasantry which was the key support base
    of the LF govt in the state and again was done through the administrative and
    constitutional machinery &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it did not need and revolution or
    state-sponsored violence in the countryside. Within India, the state does not
    have the level of force to coerce land reform in the countryside or even to control
    agricultural production and distribution, attempts to do so by the Indira Gandhi
    govt in 1971-2 and during the Emergency were an abject failure. Also I don't
    know where you got the idea that the 'Yadav peasantry'
    have kicked out the Rajputs and bhumihars from Bihar &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; this
    certainly has not happened, the latter are still very much there in the countryside,
    their larger estates have been broken up through legal ceiling limits, inability
    to utilise the new technologies of the Green Revolution and a reluctance to engage
    in output and profit maximisation cultivation, not through any direct 'Yadav
    action' &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; this sounds suspiciously like
    Yadav propaganda to me! Acquisition of adivasi lands by MNCs and Indian corporate
    groups is just another form of primitive accumulation, why it is even mentioned
    in the same breath as land reform is beyond me.\r\n\r\n4) 'Violence'
    and 'force' are massive generalisations,
    almost all exercise of the law involve some measure of both; so conceptually it
    is useless. Ethnic  cleansing is my term, not yours, you are free not to use it
    if you wish, I am not imposing it on you.\r\n5) I see, your points here just strike
    me as somewhat confusing. Why mention Kolkata (a city) in the same sentence as
    Colombia (a university) it just strikes me as odd and not quite logical. Regarding
    Bengalis in the US, I agree that they are strongly represented in the Uni sector,
    especially in some depts. Like Development economics (or the 'Bengali
    mafia' as a friend described it to me!) but it is incorrect
    to make the comparison between this and the domination of many elite institutions
    within West Bengal by members of the erstwhile zamindari class from East Bengal;
    the presence of this class of East Bengalis in the US is nowhere near the same
    level and most come from much more ordinary middle-class backgrounds, not to mention
    from West Bengal as opposed to the East."

    where did I say that 'land reforms took place without any violence'?
    This is a bizarre claim that seems to exist mostly in your mind. If peasant violence
    was so spontaneous it wouldn't have needed the organisation
    of a political party to channel it; peasant rebellions have been extremely common
    throughout Chinese history, which you should know. I thought the BJP rationale
    was a bit different on Ayodhya at that time, given that there weren't
    a lot of bearded Muslims at the site on December 6th running around 'oppressing'
    Hindus.\r\n\r\n<i>Your issue was with me saying Kolkata/Calcutta and Colo(u)mbia
    in the same breath. Calcutta was the earlier destination of the Bangla lord, now
    it is Columbia and others of the same ilk.</i>\r\n\r\nWell, no it isn't;
    most of the erstwhile zamindars have remained in the state comfortably ensconced
    within the powerful institutions there; US academia is a much more level playing
    field, which requires greater investment of time and effort to perform well in
    and where personal connections don't matter so much; hence
    the predominance of other social classes there.\r\n\r\n<i>I fail to understand

    internet) about the Yadavs.</i>\r\n\r\nNobody needs any certificate from me for
    anything, least of all Yadavs; they could certainly do without your patronising
    condescension though. I have done most of fieldwork in eastern UP actually and
    I grew up in Bihar, so I am well aware of the tensions between the OBCs and Dalits
    in the countryside; the whining though is confined to upper castes, in the manner
    which you replicate.\r\n\r\n<i>I wish you could do further fieldwork and read
    more Indian newspapers and know more about the nature of the Yadavs'
    relationship with castes lower to theirs on the ladder.</i>\r\n\r\nPMSL, are English
    newspapers the best guide to what is happening in the countryside?! Is this the
    same source where you get the idea that &ldquo;Yadavs have kicked
    out Rajputs and bhumihars from Bihar&rdquo;?! News to at least half
    of my family and friends I can tell you, but then maybe that is because they haven't
    read the English newspapers outlining how they have been kicked out the state
    :D\r\n\r\n<i>I still think you are impolite, and I still rankle you.</i>\r\n\r\nBut
    if you think I am impolite, surely it should be me that is rankling you &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    no?"

  content: "<i>What took place in Japan was a Land Tax Reform. </i>\r\n\r\nJust want
    to clarify that I was referring to the land reforms that took place under Allied
    Occupation. The Meiji Land Reform programme, though often called a Land Tax reform,
    was a lot more than that as it established alienable private property rights in
    land for the first time in the countryside and allowed the sale and use of land
    by landowners as collateral on credit markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Its another issue
    that the BJP is completely incapable of land reforms.</i>\r\n\r\nI don't
    think that was my point at all; it isn't a matter  of party
    politics but of state power. The Indian state did try to implement land reform
    and other control measures over the agricultural sector and realised very quickly
    it simply didn't have the capacity to carry this out with force.\r\n\r\n<i>Are
    liberalism and communism then devoid of ethnic politics, and function on the modern
    and humanistic principles only?</i>\r\n\r\nOf course not, there is always an element
    of such factors present; it is entirely different though to claim that they are
    in no way different from ethnic politics or dominated by them."

---
<p>My friend Atiya Khan has a piece in <em>The Platypus Review</em>, <a href="http://platypus1917.org/2009/12/06/the-poverty-of-pakistan%25E2%2580%2599s-politics-ppp/">The poverty of Pakistan's politics (PPP)</a>, in which she takes me and Faisal Devji (finally, together!) to task for making "concessions to the Right" by not understanding, or not conceptualizing, or not realizing the "crypto-fascism" of the Taliban. This, accordingly, corresponds to the death of the Left in Pakistan since 1970. </p>
<p>Since her piece is in print, I will respond in print as well - either by sending in a letter or printing up flyers for Hyde Park. In the meanwhile, every one should go read her critique and reach their own conclusions (and discuss, of course).</p>
