  content: "\"Cut them in Urdu, you grow sensible?\"\r\n\r\nCutting hair and nails
    is an act of purification for some Hindus (except at night-- DO NOT comb hair,
    cut nails and hair at night).\r\n\r\nMaybe it is a plea for the government to
    purify the senses of the populace."

  content: In <i>Dari</i> (the Afghan variant of <i>Farsi</i>) "nakhun" is sometimes
    used to refer to nail or finger ("angusht" would be proper). "Grabbing a finger"
    would make a little more sense than trimming nails.

    in this sense of &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&fnof;&Ugrave;&dagger;
    &Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect; is equivalent to &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&reg;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Ucirc;\x81,
    meaning cataract (of the eye).  A cataract, of course, looks like a fingernail.
    \ There is an expression, &Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&ldquo;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Ugrave;&fnof;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ugrave;&circ;&Uacute;&ordm;
    &Ugrave;&fnof;&Oslash;&sect; &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&reg;&Ugrave;&dagger;
    &Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;, which means to remove
    the cataract from the eye, i.e. see clearly.  I think that is the meaning when
    &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&reg;&Ugrave;&dagger; &Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;
    is applied to &Oslash;&sup1;&Ugrave;&sbquo;&Ugrave;&bdquo; or &Ucirc;\x81&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&acute;.
    \ I think the vision metaphor certainly works for both."

  content: Why you had the time to go into so much detail we won't bring up - but
    the fact that you did is awesome.  Finally something in my RSS Reader that has
    educational value, and in this case intrinsic value. Cheers.

<p>This one goes to the Urduphiles, out there.</p>
<p>A proverb was used in a newspaper <a href="http://www.dailywaqt.com/openlink.asp?ddir=220908&amp;im=p5-20.gif">headline</a>: "Hukmaran Hosh kay Nakhun lain". Literally: Government should trim the nails (nakhun) of sense (hosh), the <em>Jama'at-i Islami</em>. (Leaving aside the <em>JI</em> from this discussion) Meaning that someone is being stupid, or doing something without much thought, and should change? "Nakhun Laina" is to pare one's nails.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I cannot figure out 1. Why does "hosh" have nails? Or why would it give those nails? Or why would it trim those nails? What is it about the nails? That is, wth does anything like trimming one's nails have to do with anything like, being smart? Moreover, why is "hosh" anthropomorphized? My random guess is that there is some verse behind this. That, or Sa'adi. He is behind every non-sensical idiom.</p>
<p>Apparently, in English, "cutting nails" has some associations - Shakespeare name-checked that a few times. From a ditty cited in <em>Dictionary of Proverbs</em>: "Cut them on a Monday, you cut them for health; Cut them on a Tuesday, you cut them for wealth; Cut them on a Wednesday, you cut them for news; Cut them on a Thursday, a new pair of shoes; Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow; Cut them on a Saturday, see your true-love tomorrow; Cut them on Sunday, the devil will be with you all the week". This being the height of 1830 rhyme-fest.</p>
<p>Cut them in Urdu, you grow sensible?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/">Platt</a>'s translation of "hosh":</p>
<p>P &Ugrave;&Dagger;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&acute; hosh [Pehl. h&Atilde;&acute;sh, or hush; Zend ushi, fr. ush = S. &agrave;&curren;&permil;&agrave;&curren;&middot;&agrave;&yen; (&agrave;&curren;&ldquo;&agrave;&curren;&middot;&agrave;&curren;&curren;&agrave;&curren;&iquest;)], s.m.

To stupefy, make insensible; to intoxicate:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;be-hosh&Auml;&laquo;, s.f. Senselessness; unconsciousness; stupefaction; intoxication.</p>
<p>And here is "nakun":</p>
<p>P &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&reg;&Ugrave;&dagger; n&Auml;&aacute;&cedil;&micro;&aacute;&ordm;&ndash;un (n&Auml;&aacute;&cedil;&micro;&aacute;&ordm;&ndash;&Euml;&scaron; = S. &agrave;&curren;&uml;&agrave;&curren;&ndash;+un = &Aring;&laquo;n = wan = w&Auml;n = S. &agrave;&curren;&micro;&agrave;&curren;&frac34;&agrave;&curren;&uml;), s.m. Nail (of the finger or toe); talon, claw:&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;n&Auml;&aacute;&cedil;&micro;&aacute;&ordm;&ndash;un-se likhn&Auml;, v.t.

To be in (one's) possession; to be lying in the pocket.</p>
<p>S**t I do, when I need to be doing S**t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Update: I think, I have it: </strong> Hosh kay Nakhun lo: Figuratively, Get Some Sense:  'Even something as trivial a nail clipping' FROM hosh. Why Hosh is personified? I still don't know.</p>
