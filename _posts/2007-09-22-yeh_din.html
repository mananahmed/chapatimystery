  content: Agree completely about Twenty20, Lilla and Dalrymple. But I'd argue that
    it isn't just the repression of all alternatives that has led to the success of
    political Islam - just as the Christian Right, or milder forms of religious mobilization
    have managed to stay influential in America even with other options available
    (as Hindutva has in India), Islam is well entrenched in the political discourse
    of Egypt (and I imagine, Pakistan, though IIRC the JI never got more than 10%
    before Zia came along? )at both elite and oppositional levels, and religion is
    an effective mobilizer just as ethnic identity is. Dalrymple makes it sound ominous
    and exceptional, when it's really just a rather run of the mill phenomenon that
    happens to be taking place in a part of the world where political discontent runs
    high.

    Average 8/over! For 20 Overs! Bowler's game, hardly.  I haven't seen the
    final so I can't say but, still, I remain skeptical."

  content: "Well, OK, I'll bite. I think looking at the run rates per over on their
    own is misleading. Batsmen score faster because they can take more risks, because
    there are only 20 overs and so each individual wicket is less precious than in
    the longer forms. But here's the flip side: batsmen *have* to take risks because
    they *have* to score, and so bowlers with control and cunning, backed up by a
    tight fielding unit, have opportunities to get them out. Umar Gul's figures for
    the tournament are 13 wickets at 11.92, RP Singh had 12 at 12.66. (Yesterday they
    took 3 for 28 and 3 for 26 respectively.) Bowlers make the difference. It's no
    accident that the best bowling averages are packed with Pakistan and India players
    while those two countries are considerably less prominent in the best batting
    averages - the best Indian batsman is Gambhir somewhere about number 17. Chris
    Gayle thumped 10 sixes in the first match of the tournament and was still on the
    losing side, because WI's bowling and fielding were shite (again).  It's
    all about skill, quick thinking and holding one's nerve under pressure, on both
    sides. Every ball counts and every mistake counts. Bowlers can't let being hit
    for six get to them, while batsmen have to continually find the balance between
    taking risks and falling behind the target, and they have to do it right from
    the first ball they face.   We were on tenterhooks because nobody knew what
    was going to happen next. One over India were on top, then it was Pakistan, then
    it swung back again. Right down to the last over. Unpredictable as all the best
    cricket is unpredictable, but boiled down to a concentrated three-hour essence.
    Which should not be consumed in excess. Sadly, I'm pretty sure that the cricket
    money making machine will milk this format for all it's worth, and suck all the
    life and fun out of it all too soon. It's a short intense game that should be
    played in short concentrated bursts like this tournament, not too often, to leave
    us wanting more, but that isn't what will happen is it? So I'm making the most
    of it right now, because the last two weeks have been amazing.  (Apart from
    the bits that involved the England team, obviously. Let's not go there.)"

  content: "Sharon has pretty much summed up my arguments.  The real dangers
    lie in the cricketing authorities abuse of the game; seeing only dollar signs
    they will arrange tournament after tournament (all aimed at the Indian market
    -- the only mass market for cricket). This will ruin the game.  The only
    other danger is if cricketers start seeing 20/20 as the \"only\" version worth
    playing. I don't think that will happen as being known as a mere slogger/clobber
    of the ball doesn't appear to get a professional cricketer the respect of his
    peers."

<p>As a birthday gift (contestable) to you, my gentle reader, I will post all the things that have been looming in my head for the past week. All. Watch this space. </p>
<p><b>I.</b> </p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7008837.stm">India vs. Pakistan</a> in the World Cup Twenty20 Finals. I am sure this is big news in the subcontinent. Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Dhoni. Imran Nazir and Shahid Afridi. There is <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/current/story/311999.html">a solid defense</a> of the Twenty20 format by Osman Samiuddin from the Pakistani [and Indian, as well] perspective:</p>
<blockquote><p>About right, too, for the format is one the average Pakistani, fan and player, easily recognises and feels comfortable with. England may have been responsible for institutionalising and selling the concept, but its informal, Asian cousin, played out on streets with apartments as spectators and on grounds with cement pitches and dangerous outfields has long been Pakistan cricket's lifeline.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, then, really the game that us desi kids played and play. The tennis ball version [taped ball or not], usually 10 or 12 overs; the hard ball version, 20 or 25 overs; on a cement pitch; front-foot, across the line batting; block hole, yorker bowling; aggressive fielding, running; uptempo and hurried pace. I have played this version of the game my entire life. Here is the rub, though. When we played this game, the goal was to get better, to learn to stay at the crease, to master the art of bowling according to a plan not as a reaction, to learn to keep control of the ball even after you have hit it. The goal, was to play a full game of cricket. There were/are tons of yuvrags, afridis ... everyone had to have such players. They were called <i>dharay</i> (clobberers). I don't remember any particular pride associated with such a designation.</p>
<p>Admit it. The odds are stacked against the bowler in cricket. The batsman is padded, and has a very thick stick and can catch a break by moving to the non-stricker's end. The beauty of cricket is to make those odds even out - by pitch, by bowl, by field, by pace. And <i>then</i> ask the bat to rise to the occasion. 2020 makes a mockery of that balance and stacks everything to credit the bat. Smaller boundaries, hampered field placement, and the urge to "measure the distance of the Sixes".</p>
<p>Sure it is fun comparing Yuvrag's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bob85WbW8cU">6 in six balls</a> performance, to Gibb's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ErM_w04U14">6 in six balls</a> during WC 2007 and, further back, to Sir Gary Sobers' <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p69yqi5VWo">6 in six balls</a> in 1968. But do these batsmen qualify as <i>genus Britannicus</i>, to quote CLR James? Judging from the Test career of Sir Gary Sobers, of course. Will we get a similar chance to judge the young Yuvraj Singh? I have no idea. And I fear that we will not find out. I fear that the 2020 will splinter a team into a perfectly natural division of skill-sets, of specialist dharays like Shahid Afridi never having to grow beyond what they played in their backyards. How will someone like Shane Warne or Abdul Qadir or Imran Khan emerge out of this format? Nathan Bracken? Pfft. That, <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/09/20/no_harm_in_big_hits_but_the_ga.html">in a nutshell</a>, is the reason I remain unenthusiastic about this format. </p>
<p><b>II</b></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/world/asia/20cnd-pakistan.html?ex=1347940800&amp;en=cdff6f1f2d6b58f4&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">October 6 election</a> is a sham and a joke. So are these <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/19/AR2007091901705.html">noble sentiments</a> from Benazir Bhutto. I also would like to call your attention to William Dalrymple's contrarian take in <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2173921,00.html">Democracy, not terror, is the engine of political Islam</a>. He has some good points but he ignores that the reason _only_ the religious parties have been able to make a popular appeal is that <i>every other possible democratic voice has been brutally silenced in the last 50 years</i> by repressive, dictatorial regimes. The stats of Muslim Brotherhood and MMA in Egypt or Pakistan do not, then, reveal a populist appeal of militant Islam but the lack of any option EXCEPT the dictatorial one or the Islamist one: whether in Cairo or Karachi. The Mosque is the only place left for political mobilization - after the living room and the street have been taken away by the State. Furthermore, it is rather simplistic to call every religious party "Islamist". Dalrymple, I know, knows better. There is, of course, a place and role for religious belief in political sphere. Mark Lilla can talk all he wants about the American exceptionalism but we are all watching the saga of the Mormon Mitt Romney or the lack of Democratic appeal to the Sunday Crowd. Simply because an observant Muslim wants to run for the Parliament does not mean that country will become "Teh Axis of Evil!". And Hamas/Palestine is symptomatic of the rest of the Islamicate world ... since when? Of course, I won't badger the point by pointing out that the only so-called "existing democracy" in the Middle East - Israel - has never been accused of being "secular".<br />

<p>The NYT opened up its archives. Did you hear? For us historians, it is an amazing tool. Here, for example, is an early analysis of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE5DE1230EE34BC4B53DFBE66838C649FDE">1857</a> [fearing the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EEDC163CEE34BC4B52DFBE66838C649FDE">Mohammadans</a>], an early description of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E5DE153CE533A2575AC0A9679C946095D6CF">Gandhi</a>, an articulation of the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5DF1230EE34BC4F53DFB266838D649FDE">American Empire</a> and a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E2DE1231E13BBC4153DFBF668389649FDE"> critique</a>, the threat of Islam ... <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06EEDA1730EE3ABC4C52DFBE66838A699FDE"> from Moor to Negro</a> [which seemed a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E7D9143EE63BBC4851DFBE668383669FDE">pandemic threat</a>], <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E3DB1431E53ABC4B51DFB466838C669FDE">Orientalism</a>, and something about <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?frow=0&n=10&srcht=s&daterange=period&query=Harlem%27s+Hitler&srchst=p&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=sub&hdlquery=&bylquery=&mon1=09&day1=18&year1=1851&mon2=12&day2=31&year2=1980">Harlem's Hitler</a> from 1935 that I am really curious about. Finally, I have really enjoyed this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/movies/16raff.html?ex=1347595200&amp;en=e61639313a40f4b6&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss"> essay</a> on Jesse James, so I found his original <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902EFD7103EE73BBC4C53DFB7678382669FDE">death</a> notice.<br />
<b>IV.</b> </p>
<p>Rarely do we see the work of Empire and Information as succinctly and clearly as in this discussion between <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/18/AR2007091801969_pf.html">Gen. Douglas M. Stone and Bloggers</a>. I really, really recommend historians give this one a close read. </p>
<p>The fact that there <a href="http://gurdaspur.nic.in/html/district_administration.htm">still exist</a> official titles in sub-continental bureaucracy as Tehsildar, Kanungo and Patwari makes me very, very happy. I want to be a Patwari.</p>
