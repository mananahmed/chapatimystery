  content: "<i>Because he is a Muslim, of course.</i>  i KNEW it!! </right-wing
    media>  seriously though, i was just talking about the latter commercial
    with the dude that runs the smoke shop down the street from me. we surmised that
    ramirez still has another career should the whole dodgers thing epic fail.  does
    it seem like the ones manny gets a hold of were pitched at baseball height and
    not bounced?"

    Make t-shirts. Make use of the facilities at Washington Park, while we still can
    grill without having to deal with an "Olympic" rise in scrutiny. Get the blood
    flowing and the tans going.

  content: "Here Washington post  enlightens us, how BHO,s tactics fuelled the rumours
    or was it otherway round! 'During his campaign, Obama consistently played down
    connections to Islam, rarely mentioning his middle name, Hussein, or his childhood
    years in an Indonesian state school. The tactic helped fuel false Internet-driven
    rumors that Obama, a Christian, had once been Muslim. But in his appearance Monday,
    the president noted the contributions that Muslim Americans have made to the United
    States, saying that many Americans \"have Muslims in their family, or have lived
    in a Muslim-majority country.\"   \"I know,\" Obama said, drawing applause
    from the lawmakers, \"because I am one of them.\"   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/06/AR2009040600946.html"

<p>The <a href="http://www.themilliondollararm.com/blog/">blog</a> is something else. [Thx to pdcs, babu for tips]</p>
<p>Also, I will miss Neckbeard. </p>
<p>Also, also, why did Obama choose to visit a Muslim nation over throwing the first pitch on Sox opening day? Because he is a Muslim, of course.</p>
