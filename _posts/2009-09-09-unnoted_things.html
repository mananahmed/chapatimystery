  content: "My thoughts (mostly tangential) on the Jaswant/Jinnah issue:  http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah.html  http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah-ii.html  http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah-iii.html  Naim's
    understated demolition is, shall we say, priceless.  More broadly, however, I
    have seen nothing in all the discussion about the book that acknowledges the obvious
    debt to the likes of Ayesha Jalal's \"The Sole Spokesman.\"  I will grit my teeth
    and read Jaswant's book, but I do hope he has acknowledged the intellectual debt.
    \ Naim's piece does not give me much confidence..."

    they did with saddam hussien and his ruling elite...  hang PPP for exploiting
    the name of Bhutto to do exactly opposite of Bhutto's vission.  and building
    Surrey palace in UK(larger than Queen of England's palace) offshore bank accounts  hang
    PML for exploiting Pakistan like Abba jee ka chai ka hotel making palaces in
    saudi arabia and uk  and europe like pakitan already is not suffering from
    RELATIVES corruption, SIFARISH, only those related to these monsters prospers,
     hey wat about 200 million Pakistanis, should they try to be relaed wid PML
    to get a decent living...    hang MQM for its party animal who shouts
    like a monkey living a luxurious life in UK for the last 20 years and pretending
    2 be leader of karachi  hang Mullahs whose own children are liviving in
    europe and usa , for using Allahs name  and their religion to decieve and exploite
    muslims  all these so called servant of people, Leaders have Palaces

    politics.....and not hanging these politicians when the whole of pakistan was
    crying for corruption,  may be he under estimated corruption in pakistani
    society and his own millitary generals......e.g. tales of corruption of general

    of southern Punjab cutting off the noses of women   or the Sindhi feudals
    setting dogs on women to kill them  carefully wact for those who divert
    your anger towards one provence or other, they are foreign agents trying to make
    brother fight with brother..."

<p>There are probably no more readers left, but CM is exiting its long hiatus. Just to catch up, here are a few things I, um, failed to note properly.</p>
<p>1. On the Jaswant/Jinnah "Controversy", one can begin with this op-ed by Sugata Bose, <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/why-jinnah-matters/506796/1">Why Jinnah Matters</a> and then continue to Naim Sahib's front-page corrective, <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jaswant-notso-original/509756/0">Jaswant Not-So Original</a>. Also, see his <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?261816">full article</a>. I am certainly going to be using this "controversy" as a teaching moment. If only for myself. </p>
<p>2. Ramchandra Guha (whom I have discussed <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/guhas_burden.html">before</a>) wrote another provocative piece, <a href="http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/13825.pdf">The Rise and Fall of the Bilingual Intellectual</a> [pdf], <em>EPW</em>, Aug 15, 2009, and it got a thoughtful response from Sudhanva Deshpande, <a href="http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/13898.pdf">Bilingualism, Theatre, and the Fate of the Vernacular</a> [pdf], EPW, Sep 5, 2009. Of course, while my fellow desi intellectuals are debating the multilingual politician, I am unsure if we have even monolingual ones in Pakistan. </p>
<p>3. Speaking of Pakistan, the Kerry-Lugar bill is back on the Senate floor. Along with Anil Kalhan, I wrote and shopped around an op-ed on the issue but it got us no-where. I guess we can always self-publish it here.</p>
<p>4. I am sure the Kerry-Lugar bill will not get any attention (has the Afghanistan election got any attention?) until Obama's efforts to mind-control our children into becoming socialist zombies who feed on senior brains is finally compeleted. I am in Berlin and haven't watched tv or read newspapers in a full week, so I don't know anything about any of that.</p>
<p>5. And yes, Berlin posts will start soon enough. Those following the twitter feed are probably sick of this already.</p>
