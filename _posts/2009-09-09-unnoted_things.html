  content: "My thoughts (mostly tangential) on the Jaswant/Jinnah issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah.html\r\n\r\nhttp://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah-ii.html\r\n\r\nhttp://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/08/jaswant-on-jinnah-iii.html\r\n\r\nNaim's
    understated demolition is, shall we say, priceless.  More broadly, however, I
    have seen nothing in all the discussion about the book that acknowledges the obvious
    debt to the likes of Ayesha Jalal's \"The Sole Spokesman.\"  I will grit my teeth
    and read Jaswant's book, but I do hope he has acknowledged the intellectual debt.
    \ Naim's piece does not give me much confidence..."

    your anger towards one provence or other, they are foreign agents trying to make

<p>There are probably no more readers left, but CM is exiting its long hiatus. Just to catch up, here are a few things I, um, failed to note properly.</p>
<p>1. On the Jaswant/Jinnah "Controversy", one can begin with this op-ed by Sugata Bose, <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/why-jinnah-matters/506796/1">Why Jinnah Matters</a> and then continue to Naim Sahib's front-page corrective, <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jaswant-notso-original/509756/0">Jaswant Not-So Original</a>. Also, see his <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?261816">full article</a>. I am certainly going to be using this "controversy" as a teaching moment. If only for myself. </p>
<p>2. Ramchandra Guha (whom I have discussed <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/univercity/guhas_burden.html">before</a>) wrote another provocative piece, <a href="http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/13825.pdf">The Rise and Fall of the Bilingual Intellectual</a> [pdf], <em>EPW</em>, Aug 15, 2009, and it got a thoughtful response from Sudhanva Deshpande, <a href="http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/13898.pdf">Bilingualism, Theatre, and the Fate of the Vernacular</a> [pdf], EPW, Sep 5, 2009. Of course, while my fellow desi intellectuals are debating the multilingual politician, I am unsure if we have even monolingual ones in Pakistan. </p>
<p>3. Speaking of Pakistan, the Kerry-Lugar bill is back on the Senate floor. Along with Anil Kalhan, I wrote and shopped around an op-ed on the issue but it got us no-where. I guess we can always self-publish it here.</p>
<p>4. I am sure the Kerry-Lugar bill will not get any attention (has the Afghanistan election got any attention?) until Obama's efforts to mind-control our children into becoming socialist zombies who feed on senior brains is finally compeleted. I am in Berlin and haven't watched tv or read newspapers in a full week, so I don't know anything about any of that.</p>
<p>5. And yes, Berlin posts will start soon enough. Those following the twitter feed are probably sick of this already.</p>
