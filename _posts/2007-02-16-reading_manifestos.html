    and critically important -- the profession as a whole will benefit greatly the
    more you can get this out there and get people talking about polyglotism in digital
    media.\r\n\r\nThanks for this."

<p>Some while ago, I wrote up my thoughts on being public intellectuals in the new digital age. I had always meant my 'manifesto' to serve as an introduction to a larger piece on digital history - that I would try and get published. I wrote parts of this larger piece and presented it at a conference in Madison - but I have been severely distracted since then. And, it may have sat unfinished forever.</p>
<p>But recently, I got an email from Paula Petrik, Professor at George Mason University and a true inspiration for us digital historians, that she had assigned my manifesto to her graduate class, <a href="http://www.archiva.net/hist697ay07/index.html">History and New Media</a>, and that her students had responded enthusiastically. First of all, let me just ask history teachers everywhere to visit that class site and go over the syllabus to see a great example of successful incorporation of blogs/digital media in the class. </p>
<p>With some trepidition, I visited the class <a href="http://www.archiva.net/hist697ay07/hist697ay07_students.html">blogs</a> to see what they said. You can read Bill's <a href="http://andrews06.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/waiting-on-abdulhamid-ii/">Waiting on Abdulhamid II</a>, Jenny's <a href="http://jennyreeder.wordpress.com/2007/02/10/history-polyglot-how-to-translate-or-interpret-in-a-digital-age/">History Polyglot: How to Translate or Interpret in a Digital World</a>, Historiarum's <a href="http://historiarum.org/2007/02/12/id-love-to-take-a-public-beating/">I'd Love to Take a Public Beating</a>, Misha's <a href="http://propagandaredux.typepad.com/propaganda_redux/2007/02/thank_you_sepoy.html">Thank you, Sepoy</a>, and Laura's <a href="http://www.veprek.com/2007/02/12/three-cheers-for-digital-history/">Three Cheers for Digital History</a>. I found the comments to be probing, provacative and interesting and it made me realize that I really need to finish the second half of the manifesto. </p>
<p>But it wasn't until I read that the good people at <a href="http://www.progressivehistorians.com">Progressive Historians</a> - a ribald bunch of troublemakers, also <a href="http://www.progressivehistorians.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=937">liked</a> the manifesto that I really cemented my resolve to write this weekend. </p>
<p>Long Live Digital History.</p>
