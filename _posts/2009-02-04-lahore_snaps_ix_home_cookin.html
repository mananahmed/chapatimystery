    I second the adjective \"extraordinary\"--sepoy's Amma is the best cook I met
    in homistan.  oh those kababs, and the gajjar halwa! also there was some channa
    dish that was magic.  I am very hungry now.\r\n\r\n(also: my younger sister employed
    your ojari-disposal strategy with vitamins as a child--as we discovered when we
    moved the couch to catch a mouse one of the cats had brought in, and found eighty-some
    pairs of chewable flintstone vitamins nearly tucked beneath the rim...)"

<p>I just got back and the first thing I missed this morning was breakfast. I don't normally have breakfast - more of a cup of coffee and go kinda personality. But at home, home home (whatever that means or is meant to mean), I revert to some indeterminate age wherein I used to have three meals a day, plus chai, plus snacks. </p>
<p>The funny thing is that I don't seem to remember any age when I was a breakfast kind by choice.<br />
<!--more--><br />
So my usual is a paratha + tea.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345834/" title="Paratha by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/3254345834_90113728bb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Paratha" /></a></p>
<p>And sometimes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakarkhani">baqarkhani</a> + green tea.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518245/" title="Baqarkhani by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3253518245_0f0708d1c8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Baqarkhani" /></a></p>
<p>Another option, not to be taken lightly, is Sri Pa'ie, i.e. Goat Feet.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518983/" title="Pa'ie  by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3253518983_968d225117.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pa'ie " /></a></p>
<p>And the final, typical Lahori, option is Biryani.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253519107/" title="Biryani by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3441/3253519107_5a9b6bd0ce.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Biryani" /></a></p>
<p>Lunches can be slightly lighter - considering. </p>
<p>Spinach is an old favorite.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253519075/" title="Spinach by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3480/3253519075_db004a4926.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Spinach" /></a></p>
<p>Karhi, as well.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345530/" title="Karhi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3254345530_fbd9881480.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Karhi" /></a></p>
<p>Chukander or Beets makes all kinds of things red.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518605/" title="Beet by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3499/3253518605_70ec9b344e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Beet" /></a></p>
<p>The stuffed paratha (stuffed with anything from meat to potato to meat and potato).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518889/" title="Stuffed Paratha by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3253518889_bbdfd89c1b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Stuffed Paratha" /></a></p>
<p>There is the Kebab and Naan option.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518803/" title="Chapali Kebabs (Baby) by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3339/3253518803_14d1f6511d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Chapali Kebabs (Baby)" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345354/" title="Naan by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/3254345354_01b7e5d0be.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Naan" /></a></p>
<p>But nothing, and I mean nothing, can beat the good old daal roti.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345056/" title="Daal Roti by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3254345056_c960908134.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Daal Roti" /></a></p>
<p>For reasons that you will soon learn, we had Lots of Goat to eat. </p>
<p>Hence, Goat spiced.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254346018/" title="Goat by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/3254346018_324bb68dd5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Goat" /></a></p>
<p>Leg of Goat (Amma burned her hand during this)<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345764/" title="Leg o Goat by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3530/3254345764_d5dd17aca4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Leg o Goat" /></a></p>
<p>Some more Goat.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345276/" title="Goat by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3328/3254345276_33d8f08173.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Goat" /></a></p>
<p>And some extra Goat.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345224/" title="Goat by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/3254345224_173edb8a7e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Goat" /></a></p>
<p>And some Goat Pulaoo.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345166/" title="Pulaoo by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3254345166_4e36944312.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pulaoo" /></a></p>
<p>And some Goat with Turnip.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253519153/" title="Turnip by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/3253519153_b4159e34bb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Turnip" /></a></p>
<p>There was even some Goat Intestine aka Ojaris that I did not, I repeat, did not touch.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3253518645/" title="Intestines by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3253518645_d083d6eb07.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Intestines" /></a></p>
<p>Funny story about them ojaris. In me youth, there was some furniture that I thought was immovable next to our dining table. For a good long while, I would chuck whatever I did not enjoy eating (ojari, anything green) behind that furniture when my Amma was not looking. I would have a clean plate and a good reputation. Except when it came time to move, and the movers moved the furniture. Anyways. </p>
<p>One can end it all with some amazing Carrot halwa.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3254345088/" title="Carrot Halwa by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/3254345088_35c0c14851.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Carrot Halwa" /></a></p>
<p>All food courtesy of the extraordinary chef that is my dearest mother. </p>
