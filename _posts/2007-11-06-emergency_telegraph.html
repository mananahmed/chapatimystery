  content: "That booklet is fantastic. Good to have those links as some sort of reference
    point/roadmap.  Hey, speaking of Bhutto (who was mentioned in the booklet),
    I just read in the NYT that she has largely sidestepped the issue of the judiciary
    and focused on elections instead.   Also, just want to throw this out: she

  content: "Dalee Benazir Bhutto who is the most corrupt woman in Pakistani history
    wife of zardari police tout is viewed as hero. Nawaz Sharif (lohar)who raped Pakistan
    with corruption is also considered a leader. Gujrati sons of police constable
    who made millions in corruption are viewed as leaders. Chaudhari Shamshad of Kamoke
    who is son of Wakil khan who did not owned two inches of land and now his sons
    are billionaires.  Also from Kamoke the Son of Nazir (balungara) who's father
    owned 3 acres has purchased over 1500 acres with cash. Where did all this money
    come from ofcourse, corruption, Looting the poor, being police touts. What
    the fuck is wrong with the people of Pakistan that they love corrupt dishonest
    bastards rather than a good human being like Imran Khan."

  content: "It is to respond comments by shawana who unintentionally toeing the line
    of dictators. From Ayub to Mushaff all blames politicians for corruption Let
    me her that it is only politicians who fight dictators .dictators do not go by
    writing smoky words on internet. Now this is the benazir Bhutto who is fighting
    the present army ruler. Only workers are people party who are bearing the burnt
    of state oppression. I respect Imran I respect all politicians but no one is super
    humane. He was the man who sported and voted a army dictator in referendum he
    too is alleged to be involved in a kind of corruption which is called moral corruption
    But it is not the time to condemn to our leaders in Pakistan it is time to sport
    every one who stand for revival constitution and courts so do not be depressed
    keep it up the movement these lines geo news is says that it is being forced to
    be closed but even then do not loose heart we the people of Pakistan shall win
    at last"

  content: "&ldquo;Free and fair&rdquo; elections, back to
    &ldquo;true democracy,&rdquo; as promised by a dictator,
    ruling under an emergency, to a bunch of democrats ready to cut a deal, is not
    going to do much good. It will be very old wine in very old bottles. Well-wishers
    of Pakistan, at home and abroad, need to grasp the one promising development in
    an otherwise sorry history. They have to agree on a one-point agenda&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
    Supreme Court has to be restored; the independence of the judiciary has to be
    guaranteed. This is the only leverage we have at the moment, the one issue on
    which a broad coalition can unite. This is where the fight for &ldquo;true
    democracy&rdquo; begins. Whomsoever is next anointed by God would need
    to be put to this test of sincerity. Otherwise, the moment and the opening would
    be lost. Those who are fighting would need to go on fighting."
