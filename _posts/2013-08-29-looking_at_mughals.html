  content: "I look forward to the piece -- these images are fantastic (the Dutch one
    from 1667 is soooo cool).  As an aside, I only read Eaton's book on eight
    Deccan lives a year or two ago, and it is very good indeed, and reminded me of
    a CM post a few years ago (around the time Dalrymple's book on the Last Mughal/1857
    was published) about historiography and accessible writing: Eaton's \"A Social
    History of the Deccan\" is among the most readable academic works of history I
    have read in years.  In particular, Eaton is able to convey both that which is
    representative or illustrative (of the wider context) in the lives he selects;
    as well as their remarkable individuality (most memorably in the chapters on Mahmud
    Gawan, Malik Ambar, and Tarabai).  Anyone know of any full-length biographies
    of Ambar or the others?"

<p>Lately I have been thinking about narrativizing visual language of Mughal art. Which is a weird way of saying I want to talk about Mughal art telling stories. Which is even more of a weird way of saying I am beginning to see a future article in which I, a historian of text, looks.</p>
<p>Looking seems to be the motif of the summer, in retrospect. </p>
<p>In any event, gentle readers, I (@sepoy) tweeted a number of images which are helpfully storified here by CM Intern (to be disclosed soon) and CM Head Archivist (@salmaan_H). The article will most certainly look something like this.<br />
