  content: "Zizek's letter was indeed atrocious: I should assign it to my Chinese
    history undergrads for critiquing; they'd tear it to shreds.   And Doniger
    was fun. I've needed a refresher on the Indo-European language thing for a while.  Your
    and Nathanael's conversation actually prompted me to contribute to the symposium,
    something I haven't done in ages."

    can also download a whole mixtape he is offering online for free @:   \"http://www.zshare.net/download/73005630051e78/\"  This
    was produced by A-L-I, another very talented desi hip-hop head originally hailing
    from Karachi --> myspace,com/aligotbeats"

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>The revelation was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2424919231/" title="Chee Malabar by sepoy, on Flickr">Chee Malabar</a>. I know, and knew, that Yogi B will be global. They are way too talented and ferocious, live - to not force themselves into every iPod on the block. They are also incredibly genuine and warm. But, it is Chee, for whom I must evangelize. Though, I had heard a few tracks before, read a <a href="http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=62">profile</a> or <a href="http://www.littleindia.com/news/137/ARTICLE/1340/2006-10-12.html">two</a> - I had never talked to him. And now I have all the zeal of the newly converted. <a href="http://ohhla.com/anonymous/himalayn/wince_at/postcard.him.txt">Read</a> these lyrics and discover it too - this is one poet, artist, writer and rapper who needs your support. In fact, all my gentle readers need to go buy the albums -  <a href="http://www.himalayanproject.com/">himalayan project</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/obliquebrown">oblique brown</a> - and then seek him out when he comes to your neck of the woods or better still, invite him to your neck of the wood. Ok go. </p>
<ul>
<li>First off, a sunday reading link to myself! Nathanael Robinson and Manan Ahmed had a <a href="http://www.hnn.us/blogs/entries/49564.html">conversation</a> about memory and history and they put it up for you to read. It is not anything special (if only to see how badly I write when I write 'academic').
<li>However, I can spot excellent writing from a mile away. Wendy Doniger's essay in the LRB, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n07/doni01_.html">The Land East of the Asterik</a> is profound, funny, comprehensive and just an all around must-read on IE, PIE and horses. She really is a beacon of shining light in our dim academic world.
<li>Also in the LRB is Zizek's rather merde-y letter on <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n08/letters.html#letter5">China and Tibet</a>. He seems to be ill-informed about a lot of things in there - including Fareed Zakaria's brilliance.
<li>A nice <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2274021,00.html">overview</a> of Palestinian cinema by Nicholas Blincoe in the Guardian.
<li>MQM <a href="http://www.weeklypulse.org/pulse/article/1656.html">must</a> be stopped from terrorizing the citizens of Karachi.
<li>Finally, it appears that bloggers and netizens can now link directly to Encyclopedia Brittanica. Let's test it: <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/252064/al-Hajjaj">al-&aacute;&cedil;&curren;ajj&Auml;j</a> al-&aacute;&cedil;&curren;ajj&Auml;j ibn Y&Aring;&laquo;suf ath-Thaqaf&Auml;&laquo;</a>
</ul>
<p>Below the fold, another number from Yogi B and Natchatra from Hiphopistan.<br />
