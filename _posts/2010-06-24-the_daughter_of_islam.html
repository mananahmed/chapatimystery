  content: An armed struggle to free Aafiyah would surely lead to the A-bomb being
    dropped on Pakistan or a tirade of just bombs dropped on Pakistan. The country
    that holds the key to the jail cell, rules the world. Very unfortunate.

    point You totally missed in the blog.....\r\n\"The reason for all the troubles
    among us is the unjust behavior of leader of the world. Plus the blind-folded,
    illiterate-Mullah follower \"Muslim Society\". \r\n\r\nI totally disagree to this
    point of yours:\r\n\"this is exactly why we need new histories of Pakistan\"\r\n\r\nWe
    do not need to change the history...We need to correct the present!\r\n\r\npeople
    like you and i studied the same things...watched the same drama's on PTV. Plus
    tell me honestly...how many do you know who really care what has happened to Afia
    saddique and want to take a stand for it???\r\n\r\nPlus its not necessary that
    whenever someone refers to a savior like Muhammad bin Qasim....we take it very
    literally*.  \r\nThe Savior can be the person who takes Pakistan out of this mess
    and no other Afia is ever taken away!!and honestly i pray and hope that Pakistan
    gets a savior like that very soon :)\r\n\r\n\r\n*(even if taken literally...people
    are asking for it cause the government is unable to protect its own citizens)."

  content: "Hi Sepoy, i have been checking out your blog for a while and silently
    admiring your work , finally got the courage to post my first comment. I have
    seen similar distortion of historical facts  and communal depiction of the medieval
    period  in Indian history books.  Medieval  rulers  are portrayed as foreigners
    and medieval period is described as a period of great oppression and decline.Some
    \ historians have even made absurd claims  that  Taj Mahal had actually been a
    Hindu temple and was built pre 17th century and Qutub Minar was built by Samudragupta
    . Another misrepresentation of facts is that the struggle between Aurangzeb and
    Sikhs was not political but religious .  If swamis and mullahs keep rewriting
    our history books, we will continue to find facts presented in a distorted way.\r\n\r\nI
    just want to thank you for making history so interesting and controversy free.While
    reading your posts on Ahmedis, first thing that came to my mind is Pakistan is
    lucky to have an academician like you.Do you have any plans to visit India?"

  content: "\"Yet, until we dismantle the whole edifice underpinning this construction,
    there is little one can do to fight the narrative.\"\r\n\r\ndismantling the whole
    edifice implies dismantling the fundamentals on which the 'Idea of Pakistan' is
    constructed. New histories, as you advocate, will not alter historical facts.
    relativism of historical accounts does not mean that historical documents, such
    as the Lahore resolution of 1940, or the 1973 constitution that declares Ahmadis
    \ non-muslims, can somehow be reinterpreted to forge a founding principle fundamentally
    different from what those resolutions intended to achieve.  How much room is there
    in the Two Nation Theory to write an alternative history? A country founded on
    the idea that Muslims, by all measures, are a separate nation, had to create its
    Muhammad bin Qasims and Mahmud Ghaznavis. Unless the foundation of nationhood
    is altered, an alternative identity cannot be conceived and an alternative history,
    until then, will be untenable."

    recently and was shocked to see blatant misrepresentation of the actual history.
    \ Yes, I have also studied same NCERT history textbooks and that's
    why I know that it was Akbar who abolished jijiya tax and pilgrimage tax .Therefore,
    he is portrayed as a just and truly 'Indian'
    ruler in the same NCERT history textbooks which we both have read. I have studied
    history only up to high school but I know this much that Hemu was chief minister
    of Adil Shah and Todarmal was finance minister of Akbar and I am sure there were
    many more Hindu ministers during the Mughal period. In our history books, Aurangzeb
    is portrayed as a religious bigot and his policy of religious intervention which
    provoked widespread revolts in the empire is held responsible for the gradual
    disintegration of Mughal Empire. However, it is clearly stated in Prof Satish
    Chandra's book that there were economic considerations which
    played a motivating role in these revolts. \r\n\r\n I was only trying to say that
    history should never be a part of ideology bent as it will create an extra layer
    of untruth between us and reality. You cannot cleanse history to suit your own
    political or religious beliefs.  As far as Indo â€”Pak thing,
    let's not forget that we share the same history and culture.
    The only difference between us is that we read books which present Islam as barbaric
    and Muslims as temple destroyers and they read books which portray same negative
    image of Hindus and Hinduism. \r\n\r\nLet's learn facts first,
    and then fight."

    in India since the independence and they do go over board in their propensity
    to sanitise anything Mughals or Indias Islamic invaders did in order to promote
    secularism. But the fact is why shouldn't we objectively discuss barbarities at

    Shaily,

    The reaction to your comments was because you didn't just say that there is a nationalist bias in Indian history as there would be in any  country's view of itself.  You made the specific allegation that the standard history taught in Indian schools is that of presenting Islam as barbaric which is not the case, and were unable to back up that statement with any evidence.

  content: "Re: \"Infact Indian history books go as far as to sanitise a lot of things
    Mughals did, Jafarnama, campaigns of extermination against Sikhs and Marathas
    etc etc.\"\r\n\r\nCampaigns of extermination against the Marathas is a bit much:
    even Aurangzeb's army featured thousands of Maratha soldiers, indeed, given the
    size of the Mughal armies, there were (by the later stages of Aurangzeb's reign)
    more Marathas in his army than in Sivaji's forces.  Nor are we only talking about
    lowly soldiers.  The rank of \"commander of 5,000\" (a pretty high position; once
    upon a time among the very highest, although by the time of Aurangzeb \"commander
    of 7,000\" and \"...of 10,000\" had also been created) included Marathas from
    the time of Jahangir onward.  According to Abraham Eraly's history of the first
    six Mughals, at one point during Shah Jahan's reign, 5 Marathas had this designation,
    and by the time of the latter half of Aurangzeb's reign, 96 Marathas had this
    designation (although none had the \"commander of 7,000\" designation that the
    likes of the Amber Rajput rulers did).  To the extent \"campaign of extermination\"
    suggests the sort of genocidal impulse that we are familiar with in the context
    of the Nazis or in some of the European colonial conflicts in Africa, the intense,
    complicated/shifting, and bitter Deccan power struggle between the Mughals and
    the Maratthas does not qualify.  At all.  There is no need to assimilate Aurangzeb
    to the history of modern genocides in order for one express disapproval of  his
    intolerance or bigotry.  Both of those are  undeniable (even in the relative sense
    of his peers/relatives), and equally, it is irresponsible to speak of his \"campaigns
    of extermination\" against the Marathas."

  content: 'Aside: on jizya, to put this tax in its proper perspective where the Mughals
    were concerned, it was abolished (during the reign of Akbar) in 1564.  Aurangzeb
    re-instituted it in 1679, and Farrukhsiyar again abolished it in 1713; it was
    re-introduced in 1717 and finally abolished in 1720.  If we consider the "Great
    Mughals" alone, it was in place for about 50-51 years of the 165 or so years the
    six emperors ruled (I am excluding the years of the Suri interregnum).  Nor were
    the Mughals alone: the Deccan state of the Qutb Shahis did not collect jizya from
    the mid-16th century onwards (I do not know if the law remained on the books and
    was not enforced; or if it was repealed), and there is considerable scholarly
    debate over the extent to which the Delhi Sultanate did or did not collect jizya
    (to be fair, in the last instance, one has to consider the Sultanate''s far more
    meager resources; jizya-collection might not have been feasible).  I am not suggesting
    any grand narrative one way or the other about jizya; but I think a lot of people
    are under the mistaken belief that jizya-practices were uniform and that Akbar
    was the only "bright spot".  In fact, there was a great diversity of practice
    on this front.'

    of the Delhi Sultanate to emulate his actions and life of Islamic righteousness.
    The plundering raids of precious metals and kafir slaves that every single Muslim

    part of Islamic doctrine of war. In other words, it was the rule. Nice try though.

  content: Hell as long as I'm giving reading lists and in light of talk above about
    "bitter Deccan power struggles" in the comments above, the most brilliant book
    I've recently read on Indian History is "Xenophobia in Seventeenth Century India"
    by Grij Kruijtzer. Solidly empirical and analytically scrupulous without all that
    cant about "syncretism" and other presentist and therefore anachronistic  concerns
    of historians who see history as tool for mitigating contemporary conflicts.

    wars waged by Muslims and \"&Atilde;\x8Fslamic wars\":  i.e. it seems to me that
    the plunder and pillage you refer to was happening even in contexts removed from
    those of \"religious wars\" (I'm thinking here of the Mughal destruction of the
    kingdowm of Malwa, or of the Quli Qutb Shah kingdom).  Heck, by the time of the
    sack of Golconda and the end of the Quli Qutb Shah kingdom, Rajputs etc. were
    fighting on the Mughal side... I know you were talking about Mahmud of Ghazni
    and not the Mughals, but it seems to me your comments (both in this thread and
    elsewhere on this blog) have a tendency to not draw any distinctions when it comes
    to Muslim rulers/kingdoms, such that Ghazni in the 11th century or x in the 16th
    century or y in the 18th century become all the same.  Nothing could be less historical
    than this, positing \"Islam\" as a kind of unchanging and inalterable category
    that replicates a certain order no matter what century or context we are talking
    about.  [For instance, if Ghazni is the norm, then why does he register in non-Muslim
    historical consciousness/popular imagination as such as an aberration?  Why isn't
    every other \"Islamic\" ruler remembered the same way?]  At the same time, I do
    not regard it as disputable that the relationship of \"orthodox\" Islam to \"idolatry\"
    is one of the constitutive tensions at the heart of the former, a tension and
    a problematic legacy that cannot be brushed aside simply by resorting to examples
    drawn from Islam's encounters with Judaism and Christianity..."

  content: "@Qalandar: When I speak about \"syncretist cant\" I don't dispute the
    empirical reality of phenomena such as Hindus frequenting Sufi shrines and your
    previous example of \"Hussain\" Brahmins and other such mixing. I mean \"syncretism\"
    as an explicitly political category and a kind of normative position where the
    exclusivity of religious beliefs and rituals is something improper and the only
    worthy religious experience worth applauding is the ambiguous and the paradoxical;
    where the boundaries are broken and everyone is part of religious potluck with
    a little Hinduism, a sprinkling of Islam, a little taste of Buddhist tantra, etc.
    Every single time one encounters the word \"sycnretism\" it is used always with
    a positive connotation and association as if it is intrinsically good. \r\nSpeaking
    about Hindu rules of war, I am speaking of the medieval era. And the rejoinder,
    \"well you grant historical and ideologically development to Hinduism and yet
    Islam is immune from the forces of historical change.\" To that I say, the changes
    in the medieval period  in rules of war were not that great from practices of
    previous eras. If you want a discussion of such matters albeit in brief form but
    nonetheless as an introduction Daud Ali's \"Courtly Culture and Political Life
    in early medieval India\" is good. To put in terms of probability for Muslim practices
    and rules of war, I don't posit Islam as something suprahistorical and therefore
    the Islam of 7th century Mecca is the same as the Islam of 18th century Delhi.
    However, it isn't completely different either. But there is a central tendency[sharia
    and Islamic doctrine] and then there are outliers, and of course there were Muslims
    who followed there own \"rules of war\" due to the exigencies of different contexts
    and environment, subject populations with different religious beliefs, but to
    highlight aberrations and outliers as equal in importance historically and in
    terms of influence to the central tendency is well bad history. And this same
    criticism applies to the \"syncretism\" of Muslim overlords of India with Akbar
    being is essence doing the work of being the \"true\" Muslim or the \"real\" Muslim
    and the rest of 'em being the exceptions when in reality it was manifestly the
    other way around. For evidence of \"syncretism\" as normative category read this
    essay from the grand peddler of syncretism himself, that Dalrymple fellow.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nationalinterest.org/PrinterFriendly.aspx?id=23204"

    \"Studies in Islamic Culture in the Indian Environment\" these days, and read
    the following at lunch that pertains to your question, though any of the three
    generals being Brahmins is not specified.\r\n\r\n\"While [Mahmud] sacked Hindu
    temples he also mobilized three Hindu divisions in his forces and at least three
    Hindu generals, Sundar, Nath, and Tilak rose to positions of high responsibility
    in the Ghaznawid army. Sundar was the commander of Hindu troops under Masud (1030-40).
    Tilak, the son of a low-caste barber, who would have had no opportunities to distinguish
    himself in the caste-ridden Brahminical society, took up service in Mahmud of
    Ghazna's court, and by his eloquence in Hindi as well as in Persian, his ability
    as an interpreter, his alertness of mind, and his capacity of securing the loyalty
    of the scattered Hindu military communities in the Ghaznawid kingdom he rose to
    a position of trust and power. His great opportunity came when he was appointed
    by Masud in suppression of Muslim generals, to lead a punitive expedition against
    Ahmed Yanaltgin, a Ghaznawid governor who had occupied Banares, and who was reputed
    to be an illegitimate son of Mahmud, and therefore suspected by Masud and intrigued
    against by Qazi-yi Shiraz and other Muslim nobles. Tilak defeated and killed Yanaltigin
    with a force which was preponderently Hindu, and in the process he mobilized the
    support of Hindu Jats for the Ghaznawid cause reducing Muslim Trurkmans to submission;
    and he continued tto be held in great esteem by Masud for having re-established
    Ghaznawid hold on its Indian provinces.\"\r\n(p. 101)"

  content: "Mahavir: if we must speak in terms of trends -- and you seem to categorize
    Muslim rulers as either hewing to the theological iconoclastic mainstream or as
    being aberrant/outliers -- and even conceding that Akbar is an outlier, why should
    a Mahmud of Ghazni be the norm?  i.e. what is the historical evidence for that?
    \ Wouldn't it be more reasonable to have the occasionally (temple) destructive
    Shah Jahan be the norm?  Certainly seems to me to be more \"representative\" than
    Mahmud of Ghazni -- I doubt there would have been too many temples left in Northern
    India if there had been half a millennium of that kind of zealous activity.  I
    am arguing against a mindset that seizes upon (taking the e.g. of the Mughal dynasty)
    Aurangzeb as \"representative\"; actually, both he and Akbar seem somewhat un-representative
    of the Mughals, and the rulers in between and around them -- prohibiting cow slaughter;
    destroying the occasional temple; destroying kingdoms, whether Hindu or Muslim,
    that stood in their way; marrying Rajput princesses and elevating Rajput generals
    to some of the highest positions in the military hierarchy -- seem more typical
    to me of the Mughal dynasty.  [Aside: none of this is \"syncretism\", and in fact
    to use the categories of \"good\" or \"bad\" to describe this system simply points
    to the way historiography is always implicated in contemporary politics.  It was
    simply the Mughal way, at least post-Akbar (pre-Akbar, the Mughal polity did not
    have any Rajput \"pillar\"; after him, it did, right through Aurangzeb's own reign.]\r\n\r\nThe
    point that I am really trying to make is that rather than citing evidence for
    the \"master-rule\", you start from the \"given\" nature of the master-rule and
    then pick examples from the historical record that buttress that rule, dismissing
    counter-examples as outliers.  The historical record is a lot more complicated,
    although taken at a high level of generality, I certainly don't disagree that
    the monotheistic faiths have long had an intellectual contempt for \"idolatry\",
    and that the latter is a kind of anathema to orthodox Judaism and Islam in particular
    that suggests a deep anxiety.  That cannot be ignored, but one should be careful
    of ascribing the power of destiny to texts, however sacred these are (at least
    if one is writing history from outside the paradigm) -- else one would be led
    to the ahistorical conclusion (based on the Torah) that the exhortations to murder
    and extermination of polytheistic peoples in scripture \"must\" find their material/political
    reflection in Judaism throughout the ages.  But the Judaism of the 1st-2nd centuries
    AD is a very different animal than the Talmudic Judaism of the medieval periods,
    and yet again different from the ultra-orthodoxies of today.  You say it is not
    completely different, but that is a straw man -- no-one has said it is.  But we
    should be careful of a frame that ascribes less agency/more fixity to one group
    than to another -- no-one seriously says \"Let's read Leviticus\" to try and account
    for the varieties of Christian experience in contemporary Latin America or the
    USA; and any historian worth her salt should be deriding those who write on caste
    politics in contemporary India and frame the narrative with the Manusmriti.  No
    less is required where the Islams of the world are concerned.  [Aside: while irrelevant
    to this discussion, I have a personal stake in the argument; those who lend too
    much credence to the eternal/unchanging \"core\" of Islam are themselves unwittingly
    implicated in contemporary politics -- of \"Islamist\" movements, which, like
    far too many \"revivalist\" movements that we have seen over the course of the
    last century or more, promise radicality masquerading as a restoration...]"

  content: "I am amply aware of Eaton's (frankly and I think accurate the term for
    his arguments) apologetics for Islamic iconoclasm and that's the main crux of
    the phenomenon that he completely misses in his focus on temple destruction as
    a essentially  political act is the fundamental doctrinal and religious basis
    (hence the term ICONOCLASM); not only does he argue that temple destruction (and
    the concomitant construction of mosques on sites of destroyed temples but also
    utilization of  the spoila of the destroyed temples themselves in the construction)
    as just a political act but it is homologous to certain instances when Hindu's
    engaged in temple desecration and therefore he has the temerity to argue that
    systematic, the key word here SYSTEMATIC iconoclasm is  in a way a continuation
    of (occasional) Hindu political practices. (I am sorry but such blatant hackery
    masquerading as scholarship I find repugnant.) But that completely effaces the
    fundamental differences in meaning between the phenomena. To use an example, the
    sign of \"nigger\" is the same coming out of the mouth of a white person and black
    person but the fact that the significance and meaning of the same sign is incredibly
    disparate should be so incredibly obvious to any historically informed person.
    Likewise with the destruction of a temple at the hands of Hindu has an incredibly
    different signification since there is no theologically legitimated doctrine for
    iconoclasm (obviously, because if Hinduism is anything it is iconoPHILLIC). For
    Islam, on the other hand , iconoclasm is basically constitutive of the religion
    itself as the supreme truth and the imperative thereby to \"eradicate kufr\" to
    properly establish its supremacy and a mode of construction of Islamic identity
    (shirk etc) hence the proper word \"anxiety\" mentioned above.\r\n\r\nFinbarr
    Flood, the scholar of Islam, who wrote the book \"Objects of Translation\" I referenced
    in my previous comments properly deals with Eaton's false arguments  in his chapter
    titled \"Remaking Monuments\" focused on Islamic iconoclasm in India.\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=objects+in+translation+remaking+monuments&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QM88TMykEIP48AamquXMAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\r\n\r\nAndre
    Wink in Volume 2 of \"Al-Hind: The making of the Indo-Islamic World\" in the chapter
    aptly titled \"The Idols of Hind\" also offers the necessary corrective to Eaton
    and others. \r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=uQ7k2vQlYxEC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=andre+wink+iconoclasm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ks48TNj7LMP78AavlfyoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"

    waged by Muslims and &ldquo;&Atilde;\x8Fslamic wars&rdquo;:
    i.e. it seems to me that the plunder and pillage you refer to was happening even
    in contexts removed from those of &ldquo;religious wars&rdquo;
    (I'm thinking here of the Mughal destruction of the kingdowm
    of Malwa, or of the Quli Qutb Shah kingdom).\"\r\n\r\nI find this argument of
    there being a precise and rigid difference between wars \"waged by Muslims and
    \"Islamic wars\" to be illogical. Implicit in this conception is that whereas
    \"Islamic wars\" were genuine holy wars, \"wars by Muslims\" however were I suppose
    \"strictly political\"  as if somehow there was a very fine grained view among
    pre-modern/medieval Muslims and political actors of all kinds in general during
    this time period of the strict separation of political and religious modes of
    thinking and action; that they were rights bearing individuals conscious of their
    subjectivity, no more constrained in their mentalities by frameworks and structures
    of religion and culture than actors of the modern world. I suppose on what evidentiary
    grounds are you positing to know that medieval Muslims were self-conscious of
    their motivations in their actions in a compartmentalized fashion such as \"pure
    looting and plunder in the siege of this city\" here, \"revenge for interfering
    and meddling in my kingdom there\", and \" slaying the kafir for the greater glory
    of Allah and vanquishing infidelity\"; it is no contradiction to say all could
    have been constitutive at the same time and and the debate therefore being which
    motives were primary for certain actors. Mahmud of Ghazni, \"pure looting and
    plunder\" was a probably a factor and being a dutiful and righteous ghazi was
    nonetheless primary is uncontroversial, I hope.  Shah Jahan motivations were probably
    a bit more complicated than that but still he was a Muslim and therefore Islam
    by definition still important. This whole line of critique applies even more urgently
    to the artificial distinction between the political and religious modes of actions
    in Eaton's apologetics for Islamic iconoclasm  since his whole  damn argument
    is predicated on just that false binary. Same goes for the entire \"secular school\"
    of Indian historiography with all their baffling anachronisms. (Also for whats
    its worth, wasn't the Qutb Shah kingdom Shia? you know \"heretics\" and all that
    jazz...)"

  content: "RE: \"Shah Jahan motivations were probably a bit more complicated than
    that but still he was a Muslim and therefore Islam by definition still important...\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is exactly what I'm talking about: without any evidence, you are willing to assimilate
    Shah Jahan to the same paradigm as Mahmud of Ghazni or _____ simply because \"he
    still was a Muslim\" (and of course, if \"Islam by definition is still important\"
    then pillage of kafirs and eradication of kufr has to be uppermost in one's mind).
    \ By this logic, one would never need to look at the evidence of the actual historical
    record -- after all, that record \"could\" only show differences in degree; the
    only thing we would have to determine is whether or not someone were Muslim --
    for if one were, the almost mechanistic drive would automatically manifest itself
    in some way shape or form no matter what.\r\n\r\nI find it especially galling
    that you should be suggesting that it is I who am drawing a \"rigid difference
    between wars &ldquo;waged by Muslims and &ldquo;Islamic
    wars&rdquo; \" -- I am doing no such thing.  It is you who repeatedly
    insinuate that there is no real distinction between the two, and I have disagreed
    with that position.  Rather than cite any evidence to support your position, you
    set up straw men by writing as if disagreement with that position was endorsement
    of an \"opposite\" untenable position (namely that there is rigid difference/absolute
    demarcation; you did it earlier in this thread also when you responded to claims
    that there were important distinctions to be drawn between different periods/Islam-in-different-places/times,
    by suggesting that it was wrong to say they were \"completely different\", even
    though no one had said as much).  \r\n\r\nTo be blunt, your comments on this and
    other threads suggest to me that you are not interested in history per se as much
    as in locating a rule/master-key for history; and there seems to be a default
    rule -- of the Muslim polity as primarily engaged in living out its fate and destiny
    as a warrior against unbelief -- in place. To that end, all counter-evidence (to
    your default rule) is disregarded as aberrant and/or marginal, while everything
    that remains is strung together -- I mean, are you seriously suggesting that the
    Mughal conquest of the Muslim sultanates of the Deccan was the result of a desire
    to combat Shiism?  You mean, as opposed to Sunni obstacles to imperial expansion
    that would have been dealt with differently?  To say things like that Shah Jahan
    \"probably\" had \"more complicated motivations\" (than the primal, savage, monolithic
    ones we may otherwise ascribe to Muslim rulers -- they are, after all, Muslim)
    betrays the un-historical nature of the enterprise you are engaged in.  In case
    my point is unclear, let me stress that an examination of the (e.g.) destructive
    impact of the Central Asian/Muslim conquests of North India would be a serious
    historical endeavor; here, however, all that is apparent to me is the desire to
    set up a formula, with \"Islam\" as the irredeemable virus that manifests itself
    in pretty much the same way wherever the conditions exist."

    If it were a European state, we would clearly regard it as colonialist and imperialist,
    and the mainstream of the religion at that point was clearly a very different
    matter from mainstream Christianity in the days of Paul or whatever you may wish
    to regard as early Hinduism. And that has consequences. The ideology clearly picked
    up a lot of other stuff along the way and did become very varied and perhaps at
    that point was not so easily set apart from other religious groups, but its early

    On Christianity, of course, the limitation was that the sect did not have access
    to state resources and official sanction early on. When it did, the consequences
    were not good for \"pagans\", not just during the late Roman period but for centuries
    after, as \"pagan\" belief systems were wiped out in Europe (and, even later,
    in Latin America). In fact, the sort of incorporation into the official state
    structure that we see in several instances where the Islamic polities of India
    were concerned, were basically unknown in early medieval Europe. \r\n\r\nOn \"early
    Hinduism\" as with Judaism, the record is too sparse, although, depending on which
    \"origin narrative\" one subscribes to, violence, displacement/subordination can
    certainly be gleaned (both from the record and from foundational texts). Extermination
    of unbelief is definitely not a relevant category where the Hindu belief systems

    of Malwa and Golconda.  The reverse -- mosque destruction by Hindu rulers -- is
    a trickier question, because Hindu rulers during much of the last millenium did
    not have the same opportunities along those lines.  In the Deccan, where such
    opportunities were presented to \"both sides\", there most certainly are instances
    of mosque destruction by Vijaynagar forces (as there are of the reverse; the long
    conflict has of course been over-shadowed by the denouement: the complete destruction
    of Vijaynagar in one of the most catastrophic acts of vandalism in the sub-continent
    during the last millenium)."

    into being. Thats part of my point, that over time, in similar societies,  similar
    trends seem to occur. Lots of violence and exclusion and suppression and whatnot
    on every side. But what I meant is something different. I meant that Christianity
    has a founding myth (if you like that term) and an early history which is very
    un-warlike. Hinduism has no common (at least commonly accepted) early history.
    But Islam has a very particular early history (IF the classical accounts are true....of
    course, if they are not true, that raises other problems for many Muslims) and
    that early history involves a very conscious program of war and conquest.\r\n
    we are in a position that reminds me of the uncertainty principle (the one from
    physics): If one accepts the traditional version of Islamic origins, then it includes
    very   warlike and politically incorrect things (which may be all fine to a historian
    with his jaded palate, but many people seem not to like to admit such things.
    Of course, most modern Muslims are simply unaware of them, but whether they like
    it or not, they are likely to be reminded of them soon enough). If the traditional
    version is NOT true, then it regains the \"honor\" of \"organic development\"

    the traditional version. Either way, something's gotta give....."

    modern wars are simply the product of the sort of technology/destructive potential
    we now have -- but it should, I think, give \"us moderns\" pause.  The American
    Civil War is in many ways a useful cusp: despite years of (perhaps more \"traditional\")
    warfare, people clearly seem to have been stunned by (what we now recognize as
    the harbinger of) more modern warfare of the war's final phases, Sherman's march

    of the same sort of (especially in Africa) increasingly exterminatory war...]"

  content: "Re: Comment 52: Omar: ah, I see your point, I think I had misunderstood
    your earlier comment, thanks for clarifying.  One place where I nevertheless disagree
    is about Christianity's foundational \"thought\" so to speak.  i.e., the message
    of Jesus as represented in the Gospels is pretty non-violent as a literal matter,
    but conceptually, the same potential violence exists as in other exclusionary
    ideologies.  This isn't simply a question of latent potential, but comes out quite
    explicitly in the Book of Revelations -- in the end times (and remember, many
    scholars agree that the first generation of Judeo-Christians believed those to
    be pretty imminent; a bit like the first Shiite adherents of the Mahdi), there
    would be a cosmic reckoning with those who hadn't gotten with the program.  Stated
    differently, unlike with the Torah, the violence is not part of some cosmic pre-history,
    but part of some cosmic FUTURE project.  That sort of cosmic reckoning is very
    much part of the schema, and that is a huge distinction from (e.g.) something
    like Buddhist doctrines that we may call non-violent.\r\n\r\nI do agree on the
    wider point, which is why I had said earlier that the \"difference\" between (e.g.)
    Hinduism and Islam means that certain kinds of violence are less likely in the
    former than the latter.  I tried to be careful: i.e. I think in popular discourse
    a lot of folks make the leap that ALL kinds of violence are more likely under
    one system than under the other, but that's only so if we are trying to think
    this difference in order to rank religions/belief systems, rather than try and
    think the differences/points of contacts. [e.g. destruction of places of worship
    is unquestionably more likely under the signs of Islam than under the signs of
    Hindu belief systems; but daily ritual humiliations -- such as requiring Dalits
    to carry their own spittoons and jhaadus so that they not spit on the street and
    sweep away their own footprints; as was implemented by the Maratthas in the 18th
    century -- are more likely under the caste Hindu belief systems.] Obviously, it's
    possible to say that certain ideologies are in some grand sense more violent than
    others -- and among the most violent of all is the creation of a centralized bureaucratic
    nation-state in a milieu that has not previously known it; as the popular legends
    of Ashoka demonstrate, empire-building is bloody business."

<p>Pakistan's originary myth is tied to a spectacular episode - I have written about this<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/dissertation_week_historical_muhammad_b_qasim.html"> here</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/dissertation_week_textbooks_and_novels.html">here</a> but, let me quote from a Social Studies Textbook for the sixth grade, used nationally in Pakistan:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the dawn of Islam, the trade relations had been setup between India and the Arabs. The Muslims invaded the subcontinent in 712 A.D. Prior to this the Arabs used to visit this land for the sale & purchase of their goods. The Arab traders were staunch Muslims and therefore they taught Islam to the people of India. The Arab traders used to carry merchandise from the Indian ports to the other countries of the world. A number of Arab traders had also settled in Sri Lanka and due to trade they had good relations with the people. </p>
<p>With the passage of time some of the traders died. The Raja of Sri Lanka who was kind hearted, he sent the widows and their children and belongings on eight ships along with gifts for the Muslim caliph. When these ships reached near the port of Debal the pirates plundered these ships. The Arab women and children were made captives. Some of the Muslims managed to escape and they made aware of Hajjaj bin Yousaf of the entire incident. Conflict between the Arabs and ruler of Sind started due to this incident.((Social Studies for Class 6. (Lahore: Punjab Textbook Board, 2004), 93-4.))
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is another account from a popular <a href="http://www.kazi.org/index.php?p=product&id=1977&parent=1&is_print_version=true">Heroes of Islam</a> series intended for children and young adults:</p>
<blockquote><p>The king of Yaqoot Island dispatched a vessel, laden with gifts and Muslim women, born in his country and their fathers died doing trade, to Hajjaj, in order to be closer by them to Muslim world, but the current of air dredged vessels to beaches, nearby to southern valley of Sind regions, and they arrived the port, known in history as Debaal, where the pirates gathered the spoils, killed men, captured women, and children of both sexes were retained in bondage.</p>
<p>There was a woman from &ldquo;Yarboa&rdquo; tribe among people, who were wronged and aggressed, and she called "Ya Hajjaj". When this accident's news arrived to Hajjaj, he reposed her call by saying "Labbaik", then he sent a message to king of Sind Dahir requesting him to release Muslim women, captured by pirates, but the king replied on his appeal that those, who arrested them are thieves, and I don't have any control on them. Therefore this campaign sent by Hajjaj to Sind.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see this narrative explicated in a popular TV serial from 2002, <a href="http://www.desistore.com/labbaikdvd.html">Labaik</a> (watch from 5:00 [sorry, no subtitles]):</p>

<p>The TV-serial is a fascinating reversal, where the scene shifts from Khaldunian time to Ayodha time to finally a frame where the Hindu woman saves a Muslim man's life by reminding the Hindu mob that they dared sully a Muslim woman centuries before, thus igniting the passion of the Muslim armies to conquer this infidel land. Gripping.</p>

<p>This narrative is woven into the fabric of the Pakistani state and I don't really have the time, nor the space, to tell you more (you can read my dissertation, I guess) but I do want to quote from it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The political memory of Muhammad b. Qasim seemed to have retreated from public space - even the Sindhi challenge apparently routinized. However, during this summer of 2008, a new public manifestation of Muhammad b. Qasim emerged. Dr Aafia Siddiqi, a Pakistani woman, accused by the U.S. state of being an al-Qaeda operative was apprehended in Afghanistan, and shipped to New York to stand trial.</p>
<p>Her arrest and deportation has caused immense public scrutiny in Pakistani media and it remains an on-going saga. What caught my attention were the public pleas - by columnists and editorials - for a Muhammad b. Qasim to rescue her, &ldquo;I wish that this nation had a Muhammad b. Qasim who could hear the screams of Aafia Siddiqui, and help her. We need him and his army.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Another columnist raised the specter of &ldquo;Muhammad b. Qasim of the pen&rdquo;:</p>
<p>In that NY jail, a daughter of my nation, is also calling for a Muhammad b. Qasim or a Mahmud Ghaznavi. She must be re- membering the justice of Umar Farooq. But my dear sister, our leaders cannot break their internal and external agreements with New York and Washington. Because after giving you away, along with 600 others, those agreements are even stronger. And we also got millions of dollars. Now only the American clouds are rain- ing dollars on our thoughts and emotions. But my sister, do not despair, the Muhammad b. Qasims of &rdquo;Pen&rdquo; are coming to your rescue.</p>
<p>Other commentators drew explicit comparisons to the Muslim women kid- napped by pirates in the eighth century</p></blockquote>
<p>The torch-bearer for this "Aafiya Siddiqa is the Original Daughter of Islam" meme was a columnist from the <em>Daily Jang</em> Ishtiaq Baig whose original column, <em>Prisoner Number 650 Aafiya Siddiqui </em> became the rallying cry of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzAvNeoDKUc">various religious parties</a> and conspiracy theorists. Two years later, Siddiqui is the <a href="http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/04/07/not_a_daughter_of_pakistan">cause of the nation</a>, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/national/848-pakistanis-in-indian-jails,-senate-informed-010">debated in Senate</a>, with the Lahore High Court ordering the government <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/19180/lhc-directs-govt-to-defend-dr-aafia-in-us-court/">to foot her defense bills</a>. Here is a report, <a href="http://www.nawaiwaqt.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-urdu-online/National/24-Jun-2010/32438">published today</a>, citing the sister of Aafiya Siddiqa, Fauzia, saying <em> we are waiting for a Muhammad bin Qasim to come and rescue Aafiya</em>.</p>
<p>This particular brand of national machismo projected onto a woman's body is neither new nor unique, yet it is a potent mixture in the oppressive, patriarchal Pakistani middle class. The mullahs can safely rage about the nation's daughter, and the street urchins can eagerly vow to invade Manhattan. </p>
<p>Yet, until we dismantle the whole edifice underpinning this construction, there is little one can do to fight the narrative. Aafiya Siddiqui may well have caught the nation's attention without the literary linkage to Pakistan's originary past - her story is fabulous enough. But it is that very link which sustains it now, gives it immediate historical resonance and, most importantly, predicts the future - an armed struggle to <a href="http://www.freeaafia.org/">free Aafiya</a>. Such is the power of historical memory, such is the reach of state-sanctioned hegemonic accounts. And this is exactly why we need new histories of Pakistan.</p>
