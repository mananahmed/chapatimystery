    of the times.  Even 10 years ago he says, it would have been unusual to see
    a woman in a full veil, or niqab, on campus. Now a woman who does not cover her
    head is the exception. \" *******  And how's that different than any

  content: 'Salman: in defense of Hoodbhoy, I suspect he is commenting on the CHANGE,
    and the trend -- 15-20 years ago in my family in Pakistan, you would have seen
    zero hijabs, and now there are many many women who choose to wear it.  The French
    and Turkish intolerant attitude is unacceptable to me (I far prefer the American
    and Indian "models", oriented toward individual and communitarian self-expression,
    respectively), but I do not think one is playing to the intolerant secular fanatic
    gallery by acknowledging that there is a trend in many countries, that the trend
    might well have certain ideological implications (at a minimum it presupposes
    a certain interpretation of Islam/religiosity), and that it isn''t above critique.'

  content: "Qalandar:  I do agree that there is certainly a trend of growing religiosity
    (numerous kinds) and more importantly a display of religiosity/certain kind of
    display of certain kind of religiosity. However, my reading of the BBC article
    was that extremism was the type of religiosity that was being talked about in
    relation to Hoodbhoy's veiled students. Since the article wasn't written by Hoodbhoy
    himself, I don't know if the veil = extremism conclusion is Hoodbhoy's or not.
    I remain skeptical of that conclusion but do realize that some may be wearing
    burqas because of a radical interpretation which might have implications. However,
    I do not think that all veil wearing or the increase in veil wearing is due to
    extremism or that increased veil wearing is indicative of the so-called Talibanization.
      I grew up in a small town in Punjab and saw a fair share of burqas in
    my family, some who'd take it off when in bigger cities where there weren't many
    burqas around. Is population movement to bigger towns a factor in the increased
    number of burqas? Is Musharraf's \"enlightened moderation\" a factor here? etc.
    et.  \"Some of Prof. Pervez Hoodbhoy's nuclear physics students will go
    on to oversee Pakistan's atomic bombs. That gives him pause. 'The student body
    has become very conservative, very Islamist, their outward appearance has changed,'
    says Professor Hoodbhoy, the chair of the physics department at Quaid-i-Azam University
    in Islamabad. 'It's row after row of these burqa women.' \" [...] \" 'Nuclear
    weapons are just about as safe as the people who are their custodians,' says Hoodbhoy.
    The threat comes not from the 'mountain barbarians,' he says, but from 'Al Qaeda,
    together with their Islamist allies within the Pakistani state and society. These
    are urban people, engineers, technicians, people in fairly high offices.' \" http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0515/p06s11-wosc.html  I
    think the pieces written by Hoodbhoy are better than the ones that quote him."

  content: "Agree Salman; and to clarify, I would stress that I was speaking about
    the CHANGE, rather than the fact of burqa-wearing per se.  In the sub-continent,
    I would argue that the latter traditionally \"says\" more about socio-economic
    status than religiosity (e.g. in Hyderabad's Old City, many many women wear burqas
    irrespective of their religiosity, i.e. one does what everyone does, whether in
    Hyderabad or NYC; conversely), which is something that many \"outsiders\" seem
    quite unaware of (to the extent I were making any judgments about world view based
    on dress, I might guess at the religio-political views of a cousin who started
    wearing the hijab 3 years ago; but I simply have no basis to even guess at the
    views of a burqa-wearer from a family/area/milieu where most women wear the burqa)...*  *[I
    don't mean to suggest that one should fall into the crude trap of \"reading\"
    women's dress/\"status\" of women more generally as the ultimate text with which
    to decode a culture, or to demarcate \"civilized\" from \"uncivilized\" (as has
    obviously been happening from the days of colonialism onward, and likely even
    earlier, if we keep in mind Peter the Great forcing Russian women at court to
    adopt the bosom-exposing necklines of Western Europe, as opposed to the more covered-up
    dress that was traditional even among the Russian aristocracy, and that was likely
    better adapted to the climate!)]..."

  content: "Qalandar, I agree with your comment. I had read a few pieces by Hoodbhoy
    but I just came about this piece. Does the following sound a bit like Bernard
    Lewis or am I reading too much into it? http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_60/iss_8/49_1.shtml  \"Progress
    will require behavioral changes. If Muslim societies are to develop technology
    instead of just using it, the ruthlessly competitive global marketplace will insist
    on not only high skill levels but also intense social work habits. The latter
    are not easily reconcilable with religious demands made on a fully observant Muslim's
    time, energy, and mental concentration: The faithful must participate in five
    daily congregational prayers, endure a month of fasting that taxes the body, recite
    daily from the Qur'an, and more. Although such duties orient believers admirably
    well toward success in the life hereafter, they make worldly success less likely.
    A more balanced approach will be needed. \"   I don't know what the \"balanced
    approach\" would be? Would it be not praying 5 times a day and not fasting? If
    so, I don't know how that would go down with the Muslims that Dr. Hoodbhoy is
    talking about. Reading this particular paragraph makes me question Hoodbhoy's
    concern at the \"row after row of these burqa women\", and that if he actually
    considers religiosity to be extremism.  He does have some good points in
    this essay, but some of his conclusions seem paranoid. \"This lack of self-expression
    and confidence leads to most Pakistani university students, including those in
    their mid- or late-twenties, referring to themselves as boys and girls rather
    than as men and women.\""

    as a subset.

    sincereity of purpose and intellect, but I agree with Salman, that he is being
    presumptous here.  The key phrase is \"intense social work habits\" and
    presumed interferance by being a practicing Muslim.I hope he means the time consumed
    in rituals and not that the very idealogy dumbs people down!  This question
    is very easy to answer by a scientist. 1) Historically he can look at lives
    of people like Avicenna( Cannon of Medicine was taught in Europe for over 600
    years and is still taught in history of medicine at UCLA and some French institutes),
    Averros, Muslim Astronomers, mathematicians, checmists, dentists from middle ages
    and see if their religiosity had adverse effect on their work habits. 2) He
    can easily compare the work ethics/ achievements of the students with his favourite
    phenotype Vs undesireable phenotype. It can be studied quickly and effectively
    as he grades them, and then keep a data bank for their ongoing achievements and
    careers.  On the flip side he can look at the work habits of the societies
    he envies, there are lunch breaks, smoking breaks, and weekends are reserved for
    fun. So interm of available time there is not much difference. If he thinks
    a La Bernard Lewis, that the very idealogy is regressive, then there is no hope
    of a dialogue.  On a seperate not of Fasting as Taxing the body. I would
    urge Dr Hoodbhoy and others to read about \" Autophagy\" it literally means \"
    eating self\". As an Infectious Diseases fellow at University of Texas Southwestern
    Med School at Dallas, I have been involved in basic research on this topic. Living
    organisms from yeast to plants to human can reprocess their aging intracellular
    proteins if they are exposed to a structured starvation, as their process of autophagy
    is stimulated through a gene /protein mechanism. Research is underway to see if
    Autophagy has a role in Alzheimer's, and Cancer prevention. In our research we
    showed that living organisms can fight infections better through innate immunity
    if stimulated by structered starvation(submitted to Proceedings of Natiomal Academy
    of Sciences for publication). That brings us to \" O Believers the fasting is
    mandated on you as on the people before you...\" So when the religion asks
    us to ponder over things/creation , there might be a logic to things, that we
    may not be able to appreciate by just looking at things though certain prism(
    secularism is favourite religion of our times)."

  content: "Akbar Sahib, Thanks for the info about Autophagy. I recently read Ali
    Allawi's new book \"The Crisis of Islamic Civilization\" where Allawi talked about
    Hoodbhoy's assertion about Muslim religious practices being an obstacle in cultivating
    strong work habits. Allawi raised the same point; why are these religious practices
    a barrier now but not in the time period that Hoodbhoy calls the Golden Age.  For
    a second, I thought I was reading an Oriana Fallaci rant, but it is indeed our
    very own Dr. Hoodbhoy.  http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/20885  \"The
    free room, board and supplies to students, form a key part of their appeal. But
    the desire of parents across the country is for children to be \"disciplined\"
    and to be given a thorough Islamic education. This is also a major contributing
    factor. Madrassas have deeply impacted upon the urban environment. For example,
    until a few years ago, Islamabad was a quiet, orderly, modern city different from
    all others in Pakistan. Still earlier, it had been largely the abode of Pakistan's
    hyper-elite and foreign diplomats. But the rapid transformation of its demography
    brought with it hundreds of mosques with multi-barrelled audio-cannons mounted
    on minarets, as well as scores of madrassas illegally constructed in what used
    to be public parks and green areas. Now, tens of thousands of their students with
    little prayer caps dutifully chant the Quran all day. In the evenings they swarm
    around the city, making bare-faced women increasingly nervous.\"  More goodies
    from Hoodbhoy: Again, he makes some good points like that about a siege mindset,
    only to lapse back to drivel later on.  \"While social conservatism does
    not necessarily lead to violent extremism, it does shorten the path. Those with
    beards and burqas are more easily convinced that Muslims are being demonised by
    the rest of the world.\"  \"the forces of irrationality will surely cancel
    themselves out because they act in random directions, whereas reason pulls in
    only one. History leads us to believe that reason will triumph over unreason,
    and humans will continue their evolution towards a higher and better species.
    Ultimately, it will not matter whether we are Pakistanis, Indians, Kashmiris,
    or whatever. Using ways that we cannot currently anticipate, people will somehow
    overcome their primal impulses of territoriality, tribalism, religion and nationalism.\"
      OK, That's probably enough Hoodbhoy for now. I'll let it go :-)"

  content: "Salman, thanks for your comments, I think we can do away with \"Sahib\". I
    have  been reading  your postings and comments. For us talking to each other is
    like preaching to the Choir. On Hoodbhoys and Mullahs of our times, There is
    a whole bread of reactionary intellectuals writing in Pakistani news papers and
    everywhere else, their sermons are pretty much predictable by now like a cheap
    Punjabi formula movie. Sad thing about Hoodbhoy may be that he being a scientist
    does not want to put his hypothesis througha rigorous testing.  <i>It is
    a small matter that the flames of terrorism set Mumbai on fire and, more recently,
    destroyed Pakistan's cricketing future.</i> For example the first para of his
    above article, declares the demise of Pakistan Cricket in March of 2009. So how
    does a dead team win 20/20 World cup and ICC appoints Yunus Khan as captain of
    20/20 world eleven? is it just a fluke? would he care to explain? He writes
    about Mumbay and Lahore attacks, frankly none of those cases has been judicially
    decided so far, so how does a scientist buy into news paper propaganda, rather
    than waiting for trial in court and then let the chips fall where they may!  Last
    paragraph is telling   <i>the forces of irrationality will surely cancel
    themselves out because they act in random directions, whereas reason pulls in
    only one. History leads us to believe that reason will triumph over unreason,
    and humans will continue their evolution towards a higher and better species.
    Ultimately, it will not matter whether we are Pakistanis, Indians, Kashmiris,
    or whatever. Using ways that we cannot currently anticipate, people will somehow
    overcome their primal impulses of territoriality, tribalism, religion and nationalism.
    But for now this must be just a hypothesis.</i>  He probably the missed
    the Rumsfeld memo, where the SecDef reflects on Algebra of long war, (I paraphrase)saying
    are we creating more terrorists than we eliminating and at this rate is the success
    ever possible? He lumps together Religion with territoriality, tribalism and
    nationalism, and labels them all irrational and impulsive. The good doctor has
    stayed as clear of history of religions and how they are antithesis of other three
    pointed impulses. He looks at the society and feels we are going down because
    more women have started covering their heads and more people have started praying
    five times a day hence doomsday is near. A secular Mullah indeed! Because ower
    tradional religious Mullah( who apparently has no lnowledge of Islam and provides
    as good whipping boy for secular Mullah), looks at the segment of society which
    does not cover their heads, people are going to internet Cafe, movies, music concerts
    and reaches the same conclusion that dooms day is near. Both the secular and religious
    Mullah are missing the whole point, how are  they going to have a dialogue? Because
    neither party is going to defeat other by  force, hence the Rumsfeld memo."

    do not share his conviction that \"reason will triumph over unreason\", even if
    I knew what he meant), but not sure that a judicial trial would settle the matter
    for someone unconvinced about who was responsible, if one isn't already convinced.
    \ i.e. from the proceedings in the trial of Qasab so far, and the fact that the
    court has recently issued warrants for the arrests of various people associated
    with Lashkar e Tayyaba/Jamaa ud Dawa, I infer that the judge believes (at a minimum)
    there's a strong case there.  It's pretty clear Qasab is going to be convicted,
    and in any event that's a bit of a technicality, given what he has already confessed
    to -- but I suspect that those who feel that someone other than Muslim extremists
    was responsible for the Mumbai attacks are not going to be convinced by whatever
    happens to Qasab.  The converse is also true.  In fact, given the various technicalities
    and procedural oddities that govern trials, I feel that the (much maligned) independent
    fact-finding commission sorta thing is often much better at getting at \"what
    happened\" than the judicial process is (assuming both are backed up by coercive
    subpoena power).  For instance, if one wants to find out what was happening in
    (e.g.) the 1993 communal violence/pogroms in Mumbai, I submit that the Srikrishna
    report is a far better bet than the cases wherein alleged rioters were tried (that
    the report has not been acted upon is a different story).  On the cricket
    thing, c'mon yaar, Hoodbhoy is wrong on many things, but he is completely right
    that terrorism has devastated Pakistan's cricket future.  Irrespective of the
    world cup victory, no foreign team is visiting, and the country will be deprived
    of hosting 2011 World Cup matches (just today I read that the \"home\" series
    against Australia will be held in England).  Obviously this would not have happened
    had the security situation been better (especially given Pakistan is among the
    3-4 most lucrative cricket markets).  The PCB's financial troubles are 100% the
    result of the troubled security situation in the country -- the world cup victory
    doesn't make up for any of that, it in fact underscores that the cricketing world
    is being deprived of watching an exciting team.  Agree with you that this isn't
    about Islam per se (a secular bombing campaign would also have damaged Pakistan's
    cricketing future), but surely the wider point: that self-proclaimed guardians
    of political Islam have harmed the cause of Pakistan, is correct (though of course
    they aren't the only ones).  Where I completely agree with you is on Hoodbhoy's
    tendency to equate religiosity with extremism and with violence.  This is a common
    trope among secular liberals, and one I remember getting quite irritated by when
    the (often irritating) M.J. Akbar wrote about it in the context of Jinnah years
    ago:  http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-historical-relationship-between.html"

    forget it before many of them actually did).  But you can't eliminate eight
    hundreds years of influence from the scholastic world. And that would mainly be
    in the Western scholastic world, not the Muslim one. Western scholars are growing
    out of orientalism - at least the ones we should take seriously. Books like these
    are real Islamic scholarship: http://www.amazon.com/Succession-Muhammad-Study-Early-Caliphate/dp/0521646960/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246082091&amp;sr=1-11  No
    Westerner could have written a book like that 6o years ago. And for Westerners
    writing about Islamic influence on Western civilization, such books are now becoming
    available to the general public:  http://www.amazon.com/Aladdins-Lamp-Science-Through-Islamic/dp/030726534X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246082609&amp;sr=1-1 http://www.amazon.com/Ornament-World-Christians-Tolerance-Medieval/dp/0316168718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246082680&amp;sr=1-1  To
    say 'eliminate' is to focus only on the Western approach to scholarship, and not
    Muslim, Chinese, etc. People like Benard Lewis aren't going to go away but they
    will be loosing their credibility with an increasing rate.  (On the note
    of Chinese Islamic scholarship, this book is interesting - translations by a modern
    author of Muslim scholars exlpaining Islam through Chinese terms in the 1600s-1800s

    is  totally shrouded in secrecy. I was trying to say, that standard of evidence
    for a scientifically trained person is always higher than a lay person. Personally
    I think Kasab if instead  was released in Tehran,given a Gucci shirt and Green
    bandana, may look like a velvet revolutionary. Again it is plausible that Taliban/Alqaeda
    did it but what ever happened to Innocent till proven guilty, and not trial by
    media. Cricket thing is complex. Whoever did it, motivation was to socially/
    economically /culturally isolate Pakistan and it succeeded as this was made for
    TV type of attack. Taliban can act with this motivation but other forces which
    are trying to isolate Pakistan can also be suspect. You  are right, Pakistani
    cricket lost some, but Taliban may say, hey this is minor collateral damage as
    compared to what we are being put through. And look how much attention it brought.  Jawed

    me share an experience with an international financial news agency I worked with.
    The 1994 genocide in Rwanda was in full cry. It had already resulted in the systematic
    massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in less than 100 days. The daily
    slow-motion killings with machetes soon became tedious news to purvey. One day
    the reporter in Kigali changed the humdrum routine with a dispatch about how the
    coffee crop in Rwanda was seriously affected by the massacre.   That was
    all it took to rattle the world. The New York Stock Exchange heralded the great
    news by sending the global coffee prices soaring. The news editor sent a congratulatory
    message to the Kigali reporter on the open ticker, a rarity, for other bureaus
    to emulate. His message read: 'Thanks for the great coffee

  content: "RE: \"Again it is plausible that Taliban/Alqaeda did it but what ever
    happened to Innocent till proven guilty, and not trial by media.\"  Agree
    in principle, but in practical fact, even proven guilty by trial or other standard
    of evidence will find no takers.  I don't think (to take one example) those who
    believe 9/11 was an inside job will be persuaded by a fact-finding commission.
    \ Similarly, I would not expect any trial of anybody to settle everything to everyone's
    satisfaction where the Mumbai attacks (or any other attacks) are concerned.  More
    broadly, the \"innocent until proven guilty\" stance, which is essentially a criminal
    law stance,* is not especially helpful given that the vast majority of such events
    are never the subject of criminal trials -- and in those circumstances, \"innocent
    until proven guilty\" begins to seem like a way to obfuscate rather than clarify.
    \ [The Benazir Bhutto assassination is a good example: when people initially said
    Islamic extremists were responsible, people said there was no firm proof; when
    the likes of Mehsud accepted responsibility, people said how do we know he really
    did in fact accept responsibility; and to this day I have met many Pakistanis
    who believe Zardari had his wife killed; not to mention that we know of at least
    one instance where the Taliban seem to have in fact claimed responsibility for
    something they didn't do, namely the shooting in the immigration center in New
    York.  My point is not that we should believe whatever a state proffers; but that
    those who often say \"innocent until proven guilty\" will often themselves not
    be completely agnostic about who was responsible, but will simply be skeptical
    that the person being blamed by the official discourse is in fact responsible.
    \ Thus, Qasab's conviction (actually not his conviction, since his role in the
    attacks is not disputed, given the TV footage we have all seen, the eyewitness
    accounts, etc.; but the other indictments that have been framed as a result of
    whatever evidence he is or isn't providing), and/or any other in absentia convictions,
    will not convince anyone who isn't ALREADY convinced.  Most Indians will continue
    to believe that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was responsible, with varying opinions on whether
    or not there were elements of the Pakistani state that were involved; most Pakistanis
    will likely continue to be skeptical, etc.  And these views will have been the
    same whether or not there was any trial.]  *[Note that \"innocent until
    proven guilty\" also means, in the common law system, that one needs proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  Thus, in the US, if the state presents proof making it (hypothetically)
    60% likely that I have committed the crime, the court should probably acquit me.
    \ That standard isn't very tenable as far as history is concerned. ]"

  content: I guess what I am trying to say (hitherto not very well) is that it is
    comforting to think in terms of proof etc., but sadly these are typically not
    questions that will be settled this way.  We live in a rather atrocious world
    where little seems to be knowable, and paranoia and conspiracy theories are the
    (perhaps understandable) responses to such a reality on the part of many.  Thus,
    I will confess to impatience in the face of many such theories -- but given that
    (e.g.) no-one will deny that the casus belli for the 1898 Spanish-American war
    was faked; and most agree that the Vietnam Gulf of Tonkin incident was also faked;
    and recently we have all heard how the notion that the CIA helped overthrow the
    democratically elected Mossadegh has become a mainstream notion -- one would be
    hard pressed to explain why paranoias are beyond the pale.  But to the extent
    this unknowability is being used to avoid introspection (e.g. it sometimes seems
    to me that many Muslims don't think there is any extremism problem, because every
    extremist attack is the result of a conspiracy hatched by someone who is not in
    fact a religious extremist), I think it is quite problematic -- independent of
    whether who did what in any particular case may be known.

  content: "Nikolai Thanks for pointing out. Eliminate is not the proper word. Ishould
    say'Overlooked'  or consciously tried to ignore it.  Going back to Qalandar's
    point, i am sure everybody is not going to be convinced but lets us look at these
    events While the live scenes of Mumbay carnage were being played on media and
    pundits were explaining it for us, the simplified narrative goes like  Kassab=
    Pakistani=Muslim= Instructed by hatefull Islam to destroy infidels and their centers
    of commerce and hence their civilization. This narrative directly indicts the
    faith of all muslims. Ditto for 9-11 So my point is that if Authorities
    had such overwhelming evidence that within hours of attacks they could tell us
    all, then what is the problem to bring this evidence to their most fair/ highest
    courts of law and present it before everybody to see, so if nothing else this
    will reduce the number of sceptics if not outrightly convince everybody. But as
    we know Kassab's trial is being conducted in highest secrecy with very limited
    leaks except for the ones that suit the accuser's purpose. Same for 9-11 , DESPITE
    \"OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE\" bBush govt was reluctant to form even a hand picked
    9-11 commission unless pushed hard. Now attacking faith of all muslims and
    at the sametime having an organised effort to overlook/minimise the contribution
    of followers of that faith, shoud not it worry people that what is going on?  Regarding
    Benazir's Assasination, the crime scene was washed and cleaned within hours of
    her killing. Now I am willing to believe Mehsud took responsibility but I am interested
    in knowing how did he make Rawalpindi administration supervise the washing of
    crime scene?  Likewise CIA and Iran circa 1953 is not a main stream myth
    anymore, read Kermit Roosvelt Jr.'s book \"  COUNTERCOUP\".  Ithink little
    simplification is in order. There are American, Pakistani, Indian, Afghani and
    other nations legitimate and otherwise interests in this area. Finally since last
    several years India has started playing junior partner to USA while safe gurding
    its own interest. The pieace of real estate that is Pakistan  is vitally important
    in these games and calculations. So when Pakistan Govt does their bidding, it
    is Most Favoured Ally outside NATO, when the Pakistani interests diverge then
    they have to be brought in line, it does not mean that Pakistani Intelligences
    are not playing shabby double games. The people pulling triggers have muslim names
    and are blowing up things with or without beards, but who is sending them, who
    is enabling them,who is benefiting? Those are the questions to answer."

    decision, and what the defendant is or is not convicted of, won't be secret (in
    any event, my understanding had been that journalists did have access to the trial,
    but perhaps I am mistaken) -- but I don't see any skeptics convinced by the court
    issuing warrants against (e.g.) Hafiz Saeed.  I was repelled by the media
    coverage of the Mumbai attacks, but I do not agree that the fiercely anti-Pakistani
    rhetoric was a direct indictment of the faith of all Muslims.  It was a shameful
    and shoddy and bigoted display against Pakistan, but not IMO one against the faith
    of Muslims.  The question of who benefits is certainly a complicated one.
    \ My own view is that the Islamist groups who are fighting against NATO and the
    Pakistani forces do benefit.  Not unlike the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament,
    I tend to read the Mumbai attacks as a sophisticated attempt by these groups (who
    exactly and how many, I have no clue) to ratchet up tension between India and
    Pakistan, forcing diversion of a fair number of military resources from Pakistan's
    Western front to its Eastern front with India (there were reports that this happened
    in 2001 in the aftermath of the Parliament attack, contributing to the escape
    of groups that NATO was pursuing on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border).  The difference
    this time was that the UPA government handled the situation more cleverly than
    the NDA government: the latter preferred the crude and utterly futile gesture
    of sending troops to go eyeball to eyeball with Pakistani troops; whereas the
    UPA preferred to utilize media/propaganda/\"soft\" power.  I have no evidence
    for any of this, of course, but the point is that our answers to the questions
    you pose will themselves be conditioned by what we think the various actors' aims/agendas/etc.
    are, and what constitutes a benefit: as I see it, I certainly don't see how India,
    the Pakistani government, could benefit from the Mumbai attacks (others obviously
    have different views)...  Re: CIA/Iran: you misunderstood me: I was not
    saying it's a myth, I in fact have no doubt about the conspiracy to oust Mossadegh;
    I was making the point that this is now commonly accepted, even in the mainstream
    media (which is odd, because no other conspiracy seems to have found such ready
    acceptance, but that's a different story).  Re-reading my comment above, I realize
    that it wasn't phrased very well, so just to clarify..."

  content: Islamic extremism has become a catchword for all sorts of people/governments
    to advance all sorts of other agendas over the last several years, there we can
    agree -- but that does not mean there is no issue of Islamic extremism at all.  Now
    who is supplying these extremists with weapons (for e.g. the claim has been made,
    and it strikes me as plausible, that India, Pakistan, the Karzai government in
    Afghanistan, all have "their" Talibans  who get assistance), and who is colluding
    with them (e.g. in your suggestion about the Bhutto assassination) is a question
    of vital importance, but such complicity presupposes the existence of these extremists.  Intelligence
    agencies cannot create something out of nothing, though surely they can jump on/try
    and steer the bandwagon. [For instance, whatever assistance Pakistani agencies
    provided Kashmiri groups, the fact is why was this assistance not successful in
    1974, but only in 1990?  Obviously because by the latter date there was a genuine
    Kashmiri movement in existence.  Similarly, Musharraf said in an interview that
    many of these Taliban-types are actually Indian agents -- but even if so, how
    come RAW was unable to get this sort of thing going 10-20 years ago?  Clearly
    because there are by now disaffected homegrown elements who cannot simply be explained
    away by resort to the agendas of outsiders]...

    I am no apologiser for any type of extremism. But I fail to understand what is
    \"Islamic Extremism\"? Now do not tell me it is there for everybody to see!It
    wants to take over the world. It wants to cover the women and kill theose who

  content: "Akbar, religion is neither good nor bad, it's simply institutionalized
    spirituality. Religion can appeal to the masses because it offers answers, a way
    of living, and is often shrouded in cultural idiocyncracies which make people
    feel comfortable. People will cling to religion like a blanket to project them
    from the rapidly technolgization and globalization of the world. This isn't neccesarily
    a bad thing. And when I say religion, I include Confucianism and Western Philosophy
    \ as ways of living that provide answers.  But because of the Mongol invasions,
    Western imperialism, and internal problems, the Middle East fragmented and (over
    a long period of time)  began to loose its modernizing momentum. The cultural
    achievements scared some, who clung to people like Wahabbi. In turn, that sort
    of thinking lead to the spead of terrorism today to combat Western policies and
    to gain control of power over places like Afghanistan.  Now no religion
    has a perfect history, and each has different problems in each of their respective
    institutional structure. The Catholic Church, for example, does not have the best
    record. Islam too, in some of its institutions, that have been politically motivated
    in the past, has done harm to people. We can't ignore this.  I personally
    think that Islam provides a great structure to base a life around, possibly the
    best. But after a 1400 year history, there are problems that have evolved (i.e.
    outdated usage and misappropriation of jihad; using the Qur'an as sanction to
    impose the veil when really that's a cultural idiocyncrasy and women should decide
    how they dress).  In the end I think we are dealing with two issues. One
    is the knee-jerk reaction to the modern world that many humans are having. They're
    clinging to their culture because the new world seems too strange, too digital,
    too connected. Many of their previous assumptions are being demolished. This is
    going on all around the world. This is not neccearily a problem, but it can lead
    to a more primitive reading of religious texts, including the Qur'an.  The
    second problem is the challenges that the Middle East faces in particular as a
    region (for South Asia, the problems are different, but some do overlap). We would
    be speaking of Christian terrorism and Islamic imperialism if the modern situations
    were reversed (with slight nuances to account for the differences in the cultures).
    The problems aren't inherent to Islam but to the political and social mileu that
    have devolped and that we have to deal with.  I haven't read the following
    book, but I trust the author: http://www.amazon.com/Battle-God-Karen-Armstrong/dp/0345391691/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246158414&amp;sr=8-1# This

  content: "On the question of Islamic extremism: An Interview with Dr. Mahmood
    Mamdani: (May 5, 2004): Complete Interview at http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/mamdani.cfm 
     &ldquo;[...] political identities are not reducible to cultural
    identities. Political Islam, especially radical political Islam, and even more
    so, the terrorist wing in radical political Islam, did not emerge from conservative,
    religious currents, but on the contrary, from a secular intelligentsia. In other
    words, its preoccupation is this-worldly, it is about power in this world. To
    take only the most obvious example: I am not aware of anyone who thinks of bin
    Laden as a theologian; he is a political strategist and is conceived of in precisely
    such terms. Of course, part of his strategy is employing a particular language
    through which he addresses specific audiences. &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;   I
    have doubts about the use of the term &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo;
    outside of the context in which it arises, which is the Christian context. My
    real discomfort with using the two interchangeably — political
    Islam and Islamic fundamentalism — is that &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo;
    is a cultural phenomenon and I want to zero-in on a political phenomenon.  Even
    in the history of American Christianity, Christian fundamentalism is a turn-of-the-century
    movement which was the result of battles fought out in all kinds of institutions,
    including schools and courts. But the decision by a group of Christian fundamentalist
    intellectuals to cross the boundary between the religious and the secular and
    to move into the political domain, to organize with an eye on political power,
    is only a post-World War II phenomenon. I distinguish between Christian fundamentalism,
    an end-of-19th century counter-cultural movement and political Christianity, a
    post-Second World War political movement.  I also do not identify the mixing
    of religion and politics as necessarily retrogressive. One only needs to understand
    the many forms of post-war political Christianity, from the involvement of Black
    churches in the civil rights movement to that of Jerry Falwell's
    Christian right, to get to a more nuanced understanding of religiously informed
    politics.  One also needs to recognize that the history of Christianity
    is very unlike the history of mainstream Islam which simply does not have an institutionally
    organized church. The Catholic Church is organized as an institutionalized hierarchy,
    as a prototype of the empire-state, and the Protestant Church hierarchy is organized
    as a prototype of the nation-state. Until Ayatollah Khomeini created a state-wide
    clerical authority in Iran, there was no such institutionalized religious hierarchy
    in Islam and it still does not exist elsewhere. Without the existence of an institutionalized
    religious hierarchy parallel to a state hierarchy, the question of the proper
    relation between two domains of power, that of the organized church and the organized
    state, a central question in Western secularism, has been a non-question in Islam
    — at least until Ayatollah Khomeini created a constitutional
    theocracy in Iran as vilayat-i-faqih.  Now with Iraq very much in the throes
    of resistance, there is an entirely different notion of Iraqi Shi'ism
    articulated by Sistani. His is a critique of Khomeini; Sistani's
    is a secular, religious perspective. His view is that Shi'a
    clerics are scholars; they should be the conscience of society, not the wielders
    of state power.  So when political Islam develops — unlike
    political Christianity — it is not the result of the movement
    of religious intellectuals into a secular domain but rather the reverse move,
    that of secular intellectuals into the religious domain. Extremist political Islam,
    by which I mean Islamist thought which puts political violence at the center of
    political action, came into its own with Mawdudi and Syed Qutb. Neither was an
    alim or a mullah. Both had this-worldly pursuits. Mawdudi says, &ldquo;Mere
    preaching will not do, it is not enough.&rdquo; Now which religious
    person is going to say mere preaching is not enough?&rdquo;  See
    Also Political Islam: Beyond the Green Menace by John Esposito http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/articles/espo.html  Regarding
    religious revival and the use of Quran to impose the veil, I just started reading
    Saba Mahmood's book about Egypt's female piety movement and so far it has been
    a very intriguing read. http://www.amazon.com/Politics-Piety-Islamic-Revival-Feminist/dp/0691086958/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246172573&amp;sr=1-1"

  content: "A superb extract from Mamdani.  It seems to me that Akbar's objection
    is to the use of the label \"Islamic extremism\", but that label is not a function
    of the THEOLOGICAL \"correctness\" of the Bin Ladens of the world, but of the
    sign they claim to be operating under.  For instance, the link with secularism
    and the modern world (and the absence of any centralized religious hierarchy)
    is even more apparent in the case of the Sangh Parivar, the foundational ideas
    of which owe a lot more to fascism than to the Sanatana Dharma/Gita/what-have-you
    -- however, it is correct to refer to the Bajrang Dal or the VHP as a Hindu extremist
    organization because their own self-image, and insistence, is that they operate
    under the sign of \"the Hindu.\"  Similarly, it is by no means an attack on the
    faith of any Muslim, or on the tenets of Islam, to point out the obvious: that
    the Taliban, while an utterly political movement of this world, operates under
    the sign of a politics/law called \"sharia\"/Islam/what-have-you.  Thus it is
    correct to call this phenomenon Islamic extremism: the \"Islamic\" they insist
    upon, the \"extremism\" is a sign of our value judgment (i.e. if anything, one
    should object to the latter, not the former).  Just as with (e.g.) Communism we
    don't ask ourselves what the validity in terms of Marxist-Leninist theory is of
    a particular political movement, so too with Islamic extremism, Hindu extremism,
    or Jewish extremism.  [Now, since 9/11, we have also seen the increased
    prominence of a sort of cheap and utilitarian anthropology, which attempts to
    \"rank\" cultures/civilizations based on their attainment (or lack thereof) of
    \"modernity\", and locates the \"failures\" of \"Islamic cultures\" to attain
    modernity in certain religio-cultural practices or characteristics.  It is perhaps
    this that Akbar is referring to as an attack on the faith (\"look what the Quran
    says about women!\" etc. etc.), but this was not the subject of any of my comments
    (I in fact consider this a rather contemptible mode of analysis; check out http://www.amazon.com/After-Tamerlane-Global-History-Empire/dp/1596913932/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246199154&amp;sr=8-1
    for an excellent \"take\" on how and why a certain paradigm came to dominate the
    others), nor do I think use of the \"Islamic extremism\" label is rendered illegitimate
    by virtue of this kind of phenomenon.]"

  content: PS -- It is also my personal view that the mere fact that a particular
    practice is enshrined in a religious scripture does not insulate it from critique;
    i.e. religions don't get a free pass IMO when nothing else does.  [But in a world
    where secular tyrannies and fanaticisms do get a free pass, it is not unreasonable
    to ask why religious tyrannies get singled out.  The move with secular fanaticisms
    (e.g. Nazism, Khmer Rouge, etc.) is to define them out of the bounds of reason,
    whereas with religious fanaticisms, especially where they implicate "the colonial"
    they are held to be REPRESENTATIVE.  Thus "the Nazi" is not -- outside the bounds
    of a rarefied philosophical tradition in universities -- held to say anything
    meaningful about "the West", and is defined out of it in terms of madness, irrationality,
    etc. -- whereas 9/11 is understood to "say" something about Islam, etc.  This
    again is a problem, not with the label Islamic extremism, but with how the system
    is complicit in a colonizing discourse...]]

    with how the system is complicit in a colonizing discourse.</i>  Language
    invention and use of words, phrases is an atribute of all successful empires.
    It creates narratives about goodness of self and inherent evil of the other, the
    enemy. So while good people may use this term in sense of  'some Muslims who
    has interpreted Islam in extreme way',  this term may also mean, once you adopt
    priniciples of Islam then only way forward is that you are an extremist, which
    then evolves into Islamo-Fascist( now ready to impose this extreme version on
    others) which then evolves into Islamo-Terrorist( who is willing to use violence,
    hence beheading, flogging etc, to achieve the final stage of the purity). A
    classical example is the narrative about HAMAS, Israel supproted it as counter-weight
    to Secular PLO. They knew the religious persuations of the HAMAS leaders at that
    time. Once the job was done, then average Gazan became Islamic Extremist, worse
    GAZAN became Islamofascist and the worst became Terrorist( in our Lexicon). Now
    Israel has oppurtunity to claim , they are keeping civilized world safe by containing
    these fascist , terrorists from overtaking everything on its way. So Israeli leaders
    are surprised at the criticism  as the world swalloed their narrative but does
    not seem to understand it. For example, during election compaign Obama, while
    commenting on poor areas of Appalachia, said, 'they cling to their guns and Religion
    because of poverty and the rest of country has left them behind'. Too bad that
    Gazans do not vote in American election, so they have to stay, extremists, terrorists
    for a while. The indscriminate use of these terms also makes life very difficult
    for muslims living in multi-ethnic multi-religious societies. You will recall
    that after Oklahoma city bombing, police and press zeroed in on middle eastern
    youth living in vicinity. In one particular incident these young middle easterns
    have to pull alcoholic drinks from their refrigerator to prove that they were
    no \"Islamic extremists\" meaning practicing muslims."

  content: "Yeah, I completely understand the need for correct terminology (Islamic
    extremism, etc). When asked what he would change first in society, Confucius said
    he would rectify the terms used to denote things. He said that without proper
    terms, people would be confused and wouldn't understand the situation they live
    in properly. (This is off the top of my head, I can't remember his exact words).
    The terms we do actually use reflect our societies. So there should be an improvement
    in terminology so things aren't simplfied or people misled. BTW The Nazi comparison
    is an excellent point.  One thing I noticed is that many Westerners are
    stuck in a certain view about the monothesims, that they are somehow less spiritual
    than the hinduisms or Buddhism. Thus I read statements like this (Amazon.com's
    review of the Karen Armstrong book I posted): \"Even Buddhism, Sikhism, Hinduism,
    and Confucianism have developed fundamentalist factions.\" Really? Fundamental
    Hinduism? Really? I would have never thought... Granted, Islam and Christianty
    have been expanding powers and as singular religions I would say have more blood
    on their hands than Vaishnavism or Shaivanism (Again, as religo-political instituions,
    not as the messages of Muhammad  or Jesus - pbut). The worldwide expanding powers
    of the Muslims than the Europeans was becasue of the Muslims' horses and then
    the Christians' boats. The Chinese and Indian relgions mainly stayed within their
    own orignial cultural spheres (Southeast Asia being the notable exception). Buddhism
    was more like Druidism in Celtic Europe, an international religion that was able
    to mediate between otherwise very diverse parties and a repository for all sorts
    of knowledge (I owe that insight to a book I read by Thomas Cleary).  But
    yes, we can go back and also talk about how, in spite of the violence and the
    nature of being a conqueror, Islam made irreversable contributions to the contients
    of Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, Central Asia, and India.  Anyway,
    I forget what my original point was other than that Confucius was right (pbuh
    too!) and that in order to help heal society we should rectify the terms that
    are used in discourse (refer to Neo-Nazis as terrorists in the Western world,
    recognize when political terrorists use Islam to appeal to people in the Muslim
    world)."

    don't think this is because many Westerners think the monotheisms are \"less spiritual\",
    it is a function of the view (shared by me) that these religious traditions are
    less ORGANIZED than the monotheisms, and hence less susceptible to \"capture\"
    by a particular paradigm/particular interpretation of a text.  Often there is
    (as in Hinduism, or the many Hinduisms) no single text that commands allegiance
    in the way that the Quran or Torah does (this isn't true of Sikhism, which is
    as text-centric as any of the more widespread monotheisms, not surprising given
    the historical links between Sikhism and Islam).  Speaking of Hindu extremism,
    the example I can speak to better than the others, there is IMO no contradiction
    between this view and the rise of the contemporary extremism -- the latter is,
    even more explicitly in this system than in (e.g.) Islam or Judaism, a modern
    phenomenon that owes a lot to nineteenth century theories, twentieth century fascism,
    etc. (as even a quick review of the texts of the \"founders\", the likes of Savarkar,
    Golwalkar, Hegdewar, will confirm).  The link between religiosity and adherence
    to politically right-wing views is a rather tenuous one (in the Hindu right certainly,
    but also in the Muslim right, although the primacy of the right in each instance
    does itself promote a certain kind of religious observance, often \"cleansed\"
    of historical \"impurities\" -- thus I was lectured much of my life by right-wingers
    who had themselves \"turned to religion\" recently, now disparaging Sufi shrines
    in the sub-continent; and the anxiety of the Hindu right in the face of syncretic
    sites is also pretty clear)..."

     Islamofascism is one such term that makes me uncomfortable. To me it says
    more about the person using the term than it does about the people the term is
    used for, as Akbar's comment about Israel's labelling of HAMAS as Islamofascist
    indicates. The label taps into the history of Holocaust and resurrects the Nazi
    in a new garb while putting the Israeli society and state firmly in the victim
    catagory.  \"Like the quest for the moderate Muslim, another emerging term
    both reflecting and strengthening Islamophobia is &ldquo;Islamofascism.&rdquo;
    After 9/11, President George W. Bush drew a sharp distinction between the Muslim
    majority's religion of Islam and a minority of Muslim extremists.
    However, his more recent use of new terms to recast the global &ldquo;war
    on terror&rdquo; as a war against fascism blurs this distinction and
    implies that Islam, not just its misuse by extremists, is the root cause of the
    problem.President Bush, joined by members of his cabinet and congress as well
    as neo-conservative political commentators, is using Islamic fascism or Islamofascism
    to strengthen waning support for their international policies.   After the
    August 10, 2006 transatlantic bomb plot was foiled by British police in London,
    Bush emphasized that the plotters &ldquo;try to spread their jihadist
    message&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a message I call, it's totalitarian
    in nature&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Islamic radicalism, Islamic fascism, they try to
    spread it as well by taking the attack to those of us who love freedom.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;It is the great challenge of this century&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    As young democracies flourish, terrorists try to stop their progress&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.
    This is the beginning of a long struggle against an ideology that is real and
    profound. It's Islamo-fascism. It comes in different forms. They share the same
    tactics, which is to destroy people and things in order to create chaos in the
    hopes that their vision of the world become predominant in the Middle East.&rdquo;
      Members of Congress have followed suit. Senator Rick Santorum \"We're
    at war with Islamic fascism...These people are after us not because we've oppressed
    them, not because of the state of Israel...It's because we stand for everything
    they hate.\" [7]) Neo-conservative columnists and talk show hosts (Daniel Pipes,
    Stephen Schwartz, Michael Savage, and Christopher Hitchens) and bloggers have
    used and promoted the use of Islamofascism. At the same time, conservative Republican
    Patrick Buchanan has charged that &ldquo;neoconservatives, whose
    roots are in the Trotskyist-Social Democratic Left, are promoting use of the term.
    Their goal is to have Bush stuff al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran into
    an &ldquo;Islamofascist&rdquo; kill box, then let SAC do
    the rest.   Does Islamofascism Clarify?  Webster's
    American Dictionary definition defines fascism as &ldquo;a totalitarian
    government system led by a dictator, used historically for the totalitarian ideology
    of Mussolini and Hitler.&rdquo; Neither Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda
    nor much of global terrorism fits this definition. Moreover, the use of the term
    &ldquo;fascism&rdquo; is so fluid, has been used in so
    many diverse ways and contexts by former President Harry Truman, Martin Luther
    King, or by the liberal left that the word has lost any meaning or use other than
    a denunciation. \" http://cmcu.georgetown.edu/68792.html"

    'Islamic' has to do with the religion founded by the prophet Mohammed. We speak
    of Islamic ethics or Islamic art, as things that derive from the religion. \"Muslim,\"
    on the contrary, describes the believer. It would be perfectly all right to talk
    about Muslim terrorists, but calling them Islamic terrorists or Islamic fascists
    implies that the religion of Islam is somehow essentially connected to those extremist
    movements. Giuliani complained that during their debates, Democratic rivals
    \"never mentioned the word 'Islamic terrorist,' 'Islamic extremist,' 'Islamic
    fascist,' 'terrorist,' whatever combination of those words you want to use, [the]
    words never came up.\" He added, \"I can't imagine who you insult if you say 'Islamic
    terrorist.' You don't insult anyone who is Islamic who isn't a terrorist.\"  But
    people are not \"Islamic,\" they are Muslim. And one most certainly does insult
    Muslims by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism. Muslims
    perceive a double standard in this regard: Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols would
    never be called \"Christian terrorists\" even though they were in close contact
    with the Christian Identity Movement. No one would speak of Christofascism or
    Judeofascism as the Republican candidates speak of Islamofascism. Muslims point
    out that persons of Christian heritage invented fascism, not Muslims, and deny
    that Muslim movements have any link to the mass politics of the 1930s in Europe.\""

    Taliban state in Afghanistan.  That being said, I don't think it is especially
    useful to insist on the term: i.e. I don't think we should feel the need to call
    something \"fascist\" in order to condemn it -- that it is oppressive and atrocious
    ought to be enough.  We see the same sort of thing wherever human rights violations
    and mass killings occur: these days, every such atrocity is accompanied by claims
    of a \"genocide\" (a sad testimony to our collective attention span being so short;
    to our sensibilities being so callous; that activists begin to feel that we rank

    Pakistan and Afghanistan are among them -- to spread a certain kind of politics,
    that speaks in the name of Islam.  These attempts are not simply the figments

    this sort of thing, they have to deal with the reality and the consequences --
    it is those NOT in/from the area who have the luxury of \"sending the army to

    this book (http://www.amazon.com/School-Texts-Murder-Mahatma-Gandhi/dp/8178298546/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246298764&amp;sr=8-1) claim
    that RSS key figures were versed in fascist literature and influenced by it. So,
    from that standpoint, I can see the logic in describing some of the Sangh Parivar
    organizations as fascist.   I think that Qutb was influenced by Lenin (to
    some extent), and since it is said that Al-Qaeda had been influenced by Qutb,
    one can make the judgment that Al-Qaeda type transnational terrorist groups are
    more Leninist than fascist and I haven't read anywhere that these groups were
    influenced by fascism.   &ldquo;The ascendancy of political
    Islam has to be appreciated in both ideological and political terms. Ideologically,
    radical political Islam claims a contradictory inheritance. On the one hand, it
    shares with modern secular ideologies (nationalism, Marxism) an embrace of political
    violence as a liberating force. On the other, it is part of the resurgence of
    different forms of nativism (linked to racial, ethnic and religious identities)
    in large parts of the postcolonial world. The appeal of nativism lies in its critique
    of secular nationalist historiography, which has tended to highlight only the
    recent impact of Western imperialism as important to understanding the present.
    But nativism does not simply exalt precolonial history; it also promises a return
    to it, as if the deep impact of colonialism could simply be wished away.&rdquo;
    http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060515/mamdani/3  I personally can't make
    an objective judgment on whether of not Taliban or Alqaeda are fascist-type organizations
    because I don't have a firm grasp of what fascism is. I associate fascism with
    the combination of anti-Semitism and racial superiority. Taliban and Alqaeda,
    are virulently anti-Shia and their Puritanism translates into violence against
    the frequenters of shrines and tombs (something that they share with the Saudi
    regime that has destroyed numerous Muslim heritage sites).    Has the
    term Fascism lost its meaning? Is it only identified by certain trends in political
    movements? If so, can any movement be objectively labeled \"fascist?\" Or is it
    that only certain trends of a political movement, can be referred to as fascist
    type policies/acts? If so, it comes down to drawing parallels. The speculative
    exercise of drawing parallels is contingent upon one's knowledge, experience,
    interests, and most importantly the historic frame of reference of the audience

    experience of an audience onto the group under scrutiny. Fundamentalism is another
    such term that has a meaning in the Western Christian tradition and its use by

    translation of fundamentalism?  Just to be clear, my moral judgment of these
    groups is that they are bad news, that they are anti-Shia, anti-Sufi, anti-traditionalist
    and the means they use to pursue their political objectives stand in violation
    to \"Islamic rules of engagement\". Some of the political objectives and the social/economical/political
    grievances that these organizations claim to be fighting in the name of, have
    a wide ranging support* and labels such as Islamofascist is a denunciation of
    the legitimacy of these grievances and demonizes those that agree with the grievances
    in question.    -- *\"large majorities endorse the goal of al Qaeda to
    &ldquo;push the US to remove its bases and its military forces from
    all Islamic countries,&rdquo; including 87 percent of Egyptians, 64
    percent of Indonesians, and 60 percent of Pakistanis.&rdquo;  [...]\"Majorities
    agree with nearly all of al Qaeda's goals to change US behavior
    in the Muslim world, to promote Islamist governance, and to preserve and affirm
    Islamic identity. However, as mentioned, only minorities say they approve of al
    Qaeda's attacks on Americans. Consistent with this apparent
    ambivalence, views of groups that attack Americans and Bin Laden are mixed or
    lukewarm.\" (Survey conducted by WorldPublicOpinion.org (February 24, 2009) http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brmiddleeastnafricara/591.php"

    think that lots of people in the West think that Islam, Judaism, and Christianty
    are too rigid and less spiritual, and lots of that has to with the Enlightenment.
    Many Christians I know aren't into 'mystisism' which leads many to go from Biblical
    literalist to complete atheist (I've seen it many times). And for some, they go
    into things like Sufism or Vedanta as opposed to Christian mystism (very prominent
    in Eastern Orthodox Christianity) because they don't like things 'by the book'
    and because, to some, they've either had a bad expierence with fundamentalists
    or because Christianity isn't as 'cool' to them. They've read the Upanishads,
    but don't know anythng about the Hindutva.  Some Westerners who follow Islam say
    that they're not Muslims but that they are Sufis - because the other aspects of
    Islam don't appeal to them. But, to quote someone whose name I can't even remember,
    \"Sufism without Islam is like a candle burning in the open without a lantern.\" The
    majority of people, though certainly not all, benefit from some kind of structure."

  content: "Qalandar, Did Fascism not dig into the historic anti-semitism of Christian
    tridition (\"Christ-killers\")? I seem to recall reading, a mention of this recently.
    Can't recall which book it was.  Btw I agree that \"there are concerted
    attempts in some countries &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; (parts of) Pakistan and Afghanistan
    are among them &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; to spread a certain kind of politics, that
    speaks in the name of Islam. These attempts are not simply the figments of right-wing
    imaginations in the West \"  I quote Mamdani again: &ldquo;Roy
    distinguishes contemporary neofundamentalists from traditional fundamentalists,
    such as Wahhabis who have tried \"to delink Islam from ethnic cultures\" for centuries
    and have everywhere \"fought against local Islams\"--\"Sufism in South Asia, marabouts
    in North Africa, specific music and rituals everywhere,\" and even Shafism, Hanafism,
    and other historical schools of sharia. For Roy, neofundamentalist Islam is
    \"born-again Islam\" and strictly a product of the diaspora. Islamic religious
    debate is no longer monopolized by the learned ulema (teachers); as they have
    turned to the Internet, the neofundamentalists have also become tulaab (students).
    As a result, \"religion has been secularized, not in the sense that it is under
    the scrutiny of modern sciences, but to the extent that it is debated outside
    any specific institutions or corporations.\" With the traditional ethnic community
    left behind, \"the disappearance of traditional values ... [has laid] the groundwork
    for re-Islamisation,\" which has largely become an individual project. \"Islamic
    revivalism goes hand in hand\" with a modern trend: the \"culture of the self.\" The
    growing individualization of religious practices has prompted believers to create
    a new community that transcends strict geography. The consequences of these changes
    have been contradictory. Those who have succeeded in reconciling the self with
    religion have tended to embrace a \"liberal\" or \"ethical\" version of Islam;
    those who have not have been prone to embrace \"neofundamentalist Salafism.\"
    Meanwhile, the quest \"to build a universal religious identity, de-linked from
    any specific culture,\" has come at a price, because such an Islam is \"by definition
    an Islam oblivious to its own history.\" As a result, \"the quest for a pure Islam
    [has] entail[ed] also an impoverishment of its content,\" Roy writes, and the
    ironic consequence of this quest is \"secularization, but in the name of fundamentalism.\"

  content: "Ali A. Allawi on \"Islamic extremism\" etc. The Crisis of Islamic Civilization
    http://www.cceia.org/resources/video/data/000241  The Q/A session starting
    at 30:00 was good. His book was an enjoyable but somewhat of a depressing read.
      \"Political Islamic extremism, or what passes for Islamic extremism, the
    Taliban, all of these are reactions of a system that's trying to come to grips
    with a world that's moving on.   And it is unlikely to survive. Political
    Islam in its Talibanist form cannot really survive for any amount of time in the
    outside world. Of course it can survive if it feels under attack. The best thing
    to do, if you ask me, is to ignore it. Because what will happen is that the societies
    which they are creating, I would call them \"reactionary dystopias.\" They cannot
    really provide the wherewithal for modern living and that is what people mainly
    want. So if you look at it as a phase, I think it does not have much of a life
    span.   What I think will happen, as I said, my conclusion, is that modernity,
    or post-modernity, will become basically the desired end for Muslims, and their
    spiritual life will shrink to a private faith. But when you do that, you basically
    have conceded the outer space to whatever is the prevailing order. So the civilization
    of life is lost. \"  Regarding Pakistan and Taliban:  \"And the fear
    in Pakistan is not so much that the Taliban will expand. The Pakistan Taliban
    are no match in military terms for the Pakistani army, you have to understand.
    The Pakistan army and the security services are extremely well entrenched. They
    define the state in Pakistan. The fear is that the model, as it were, of expropriating
    land owners, handing over title to peasants, and so on and so forth, becomes attractive
    in parts of Pakistan that are still dominated by feudal systems.   The Pakistan
    state is extremely dysfunctional. In many ways it's unjust. The courts don't work.
    The masses are ignored by the elites. The budgets are misappropriated or misspent.
    And you have a rising middle class, which is something that wasn't there, say,
    50 years ago, or even 20 years ago. You have a literate and articulate middle
    class. Most of those who can are trying to leave, but those who stay are holding
    these people to account.   So I think in Pakistan there has to be a serious
    attempt to remove these imbalances and injustices in society. And the Taliban
    will always be there, but they will not be an existential threat. They will not
    end up in Islamabad and whatever mounting caves these weapons are hidden and then
    use them against the world.   So I think you have to divide the issue&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;whether
    you want to make sure that nuclear weapons don't fall into the hands of the renegades,
    or you want to make sure that renegades can never get to the point where they
    can dominate their societies. And I think it is to do with removing these very,
    very serious imbalances in these countries.\""

  content: "Islam: Reforming a Recalcitrant Religion (Part I) \"The parallels with
    the Christian Reformation are fallacious. Reasoning by historical analogy may
    have been the vogue in the post-9/11 environment, but the inferences drawn were
    hopelessly inappropriate for Islam.  The Reformation affected the Catholic
    Church in Central and Western Europe only. The unity of Christendom had been sundered
    with the division of the Roman Empire, and the Eastern Church had already had
    a physically separate and independent existence from the Western church for nearly
    a millennium before the Reformation.  [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]Both the Reformation
    and the Enlightenment are necessary phases in the \"taming\" of religious faith
    and in opening mankind to the possibilities of a post-religion order. Now, if
    only Islam could follow the same path &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; without, of course,
    the 200 years of violence and devastation which the Reformation actually unleashed
    &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; then Islam would be shorn of its dogmatic certainties, which
    are antithetical to human advancement.   It could then fit into the structures
    of the modern world.  This bare outline of the march of the West has been questioned,
    and in many cases, discredited by historians, but is still presented as incontrovertible
    evidence for Islam to undergo a similar rite of passage as Western Christianity.
    On closer inspection, however, the utility of the analogy falls apart, and the
    parallels are absurd.\"  ******** Islam: Reforming a Recalcitrant Religion
    (Part II) http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=7841 \"The putative
    calls to reform Islam could not apply to Muslim states or to their legal systems,
    except in matters of personal law. Reforming Islamic personal law certainly did
    have implications for gender rights, but this was a special, limiting case. Islam
    was therefore not an obstacle for the reformation of state structures or for the
    introduction of new political doctrines.  The \"conflict\" between Islam and
    democracy could not arise in the context of Muslim countries whose entire political
    legacy was based on an authoritarianism which only used Islam to justify its rule.
     [...] The issue was not therefore, reforming an Islam already in power but
    reforming an Islam which could come to power &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; a crucial difference.
      The Islam that could come to power was a worrisome eventuality. The proposals
    for reforming Islam took on a precautionary, even preemptive character, especially
    when they emanated from those keen to avert a repetition of the Iranian Revolution,
    the spread of radical Wahhabism or the jihadi culture of al-Qaeda and its offshoots.
      The ideology of the terrorists was assessed alongside Islamic orthodoxy
    to see if the two were intertwined. What were the roots of terror and radicalization?
    The last time when Islam, as a religion and as a civilization, was subjected to
    such intense scrutiny was in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when European
    imperialists were encountering widespread resistance.\""

    Sri Lanka: \"The subterfuge found an echo in Sri Lanka, where Sinhalese, Tamils
    and Burghers are lumped with Muslims: three ethnic groups and a religious category.
    Do the Muslims have an ethnicity?\"  Either Mr. Naqwi ignores the political
    realities of Sri Lanka, or doesn't know of them.  My understanding is that \"Muslim\"
    is a rather accepted category in Sri Lankan discourse, and refers mostly -- although
    not exclusively -- to Tamil Muslims.  But the reason one doesn't speak of Tamil
    Muslims is that these Muslims do not appear to politically identify with the Tamil
    political cause for the most part.  Their \"Tamilness\" is not the relevant factor
    in Sri Lanka, it is their \"Muslimness\" (unlike Christian Tamils, who do appear
    to be \"aligned\" with the Tamil nationalist causes in large part).  The LTTE
    was perfectly aware of this distinction (and probably reinforced it) when it \"expelled\"
    tens of thousands of \"Muslims\" from the areas under its control in 1992.  [A
    second group of \"Muslims\" are called Malay Muslims, but that distinction isn't
    relevant when it comes to the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict.]  So too with Iraq:
    it actually makes perfect sense to speak of \"Shia\", \"Sunni\" and \"Kurd\" --
    the former two identities have a potentially oppositional relation to each other,
    and \"Kurd\" has one to \"Arab\", whether Shia or Sunni.  There isn't anything
    absurd about it, since the fact that most Kurds are Sunnis is not very relevant.
    \ I agree that it would be better to speak of \"Shia Arab\", \"Sunni Arab\", and
    \"Kurd\", but the current usage, although simplistic (like any usage that speaks
    in terms of sweeping generalities, be it \"Muslims\", \"Hindus\", \"America\",
    \"Tamils\", etc.) is by no means as absurd as Naqwi is suggesting, and in any
    event, I doubt my suggestion would satisfy Naqwi.  [Aside: I generally have
    very little patience for appointing envoys to reach out to x or y \"community\",
    as Obama himself rightly acknowledged in an interview prior to the Cairo speech,
    there isn't a \"Muslim world\", there are many, often (inevitably?) overlapping
    with other worlds.  Given that is so, I don't consider it constructive to have
    such an envoy -- to the extent Naqwi is making that point, I don't disagree.  The
    counter-view is that this sort of appointment signals that \"the table\" is now
    open to other seats than have historically been present; what that will mean is
    up in the air, but Naqwi's strikes me as a crabbed response to that possibility.]"

    and shifting possibilities.  Reading his columns (I am thinking, in particular,
    of the one some time ago in response to Obama's Cairo speech) one might never
    imagine there is any difference whatsoever between this president and any other,
    or even that the mere delivery of the Cairo speech was itself quite unusual and
    special.  I am not suggesting this is radical change, but it has the potential
    for meaningful change, and is very far from the sham Naqwi seems to see it as.

    between the terrorists and their handlers. Talking on cell phones, the controllers
    urged on their pawns in Punjabi and Urdu, interspersed with the odd English words
    and phrases. They certainly did not sound like graduates of a madressah. Rather,
    they were professionals doing a job, instructing the young terrorists to kill
    as many people as possible; urging them to move from one target to another; and
    repeating that they must not allow themselves to be captured.\"  Qalanqar,
    This is a good example of trial by media. Irfan is regurgitating what his pay
    masters are putting on the TV in the form of documentary. What happened to not
    commenting on matters which were sub-judice. Remember the guy who sold SIMS to
    these \"cold blooded killers\", worked for RAW in Kashmir, indian police was criticised
    by Indian press for being overzealous to arrest him. Even if you prove in court
    it was LeT, do you know who created LeT and its off shoots? Who funds it? If
    one day truth comes out, I would not be surprised to know,Irfan and LeT may be

    are elements within the Lashkar that are not under the control of the army anymore.

    many militant groups, the LeT was born out of the CIA-backed jihad against the
    Soviets in Afghanistan and then began operations in Kashmir in 1993, Indian analysts
    say. According to Raman, the LeT is the biggest militant group in Pakistan, with
    a larger presence even than the Taliban, and a charitable wing, the Jamaat ud-Dawa,

    equal? Was he as emphatic in condeming civilian deaths, when US/UK started

    I am saying is , he is very articulate,  and writes based on a peculiar agenda! You
    can make your own judgement  Again I am  not trying to  trivilize the Mumbay

    in Mumbai   India is grappling with the possibility that one of its own
    undercover operatives helped equip the Islamist extremists who attacked Mumbai,
    killing more than 170 people.   Police in Indian-controlled Kashmir demanded
    the release of one of their undercover agents on Sunday after he was arrested
    by police in Delhi for allegedly supplying a mobile SIM card used by the Mumbai
    gunmen.   Mukhtar Ahmed, 35, originally from Indian-controlled Kashmir,
    was detained on Friday in Delhi. He is being held with another man, Tauseef Rehman,
    26, who was arrested in his home city of Calcutta on the same day.   The
    detention of the two men, both now being held in Calcutta, had been hailed as
    a potentially key breakthrough in the Mumbai investigation.   The operation
    turned sour, however, after police in Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital,
    said that Ahmed worked for them, raising the possibility that an Indian agent
    aided the militants that committed India's worse terror attack in 15 years.   A
    senior officer in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, said Calcutta police were
    told that Ahmed is \"our man and it's now up to them how to facilitate his release\".
      He said that Ahmed was a Special Police Officer, part of a semi-official
    counterinsurgency network whose members are usually drawn from former militants.
      \"Sometimes we use our men engaged in counter-insurgency ops to provide
    SIM cards to the [militant] outfits so that we track their plans down,\" he said.

    Thakur. In a cellphone conversation between Thakur and Ramji, the man who planted

  content: "Akbar: according to these links, Ahmed is a state police officer (not
    RAW) -- and these links hardly enable one to conclude that what we have here is
    a conspiracy hatched by Indian intelligence* (even leaving aside the counter-insurgency
    tactics mentioned here -- there doesn't seem anything especially unusual about
    undercover operatives trafficking with tons of people, some of whom come back
    to bite you; that's what \"blowback\" is, isn't it?  I mean surely, from the fact
    that the CIA armed jihadis at some previous date, we wouldn't say that the CIA
    KNEW and WANTED 9/11 to occur, would we?; aside: there are known to be many pro-Kashmiri
    secession people in the J&amp;K police force; it's a stable government job, and
    one of the few sectors that is booming in the valley).  As for the Karkare killing,
    the assumption of those who see this as proof of a conspiracy is that his death
    somehow permanently derails the investigation into the Malegaon blasts.  But this
    isn't a Hindi film: that investigation is continuing, and has in fact been widened
    now to include earlier blasts in Ajmer and other places -- with or without Karkare,
    those investigations are continuing.  Quite frankly, I suspect that the expansion
    of that investigation might in fact been enabled by the fact that media attention
    is now focused on other issues, and the investigation is thus under the radar.  *[and
    to what end?  It has never been plausibly explained to me what Indian intelligence
    agencies could hope to gain from staging an attack on Mumbai in this fashion.
    \ If the claim is that elements in the intelligence agencies wanted to stage this
    attack to cover up involvement in the Hindu extremist blast cases being investigated,
    I find that hard to believe: (1) The investigation is ongoing, and does not appear
    to have been derailed -- with elections in Maharashtra looming, you can bet the
    Congress/NCP will have a hard time dropping this one, even if they wanted to;
    (2) There are far easier, less costly ways of derailing a mere state ATS investigation.
    \ Recall that the CBI had basically either been asleep at the switch or had knuckled
    to poliotical pressure in connection with the Malegaon, Nander, etc. blasts (despite
    the fact that mainstream publications like Outlook had been suggesting years ago
    that incidents like Nander had the hallmarks of Hindu extremist group operations).
    \ Is it really beyond the capacity of an agency that allegedly staged the Mumbai
    attacks to, um, make Maharashtra ATS investigation witnesses, evidence, etc. go
    away?  I'll repeat what I said a few days ago, I suggest that one plausible theory
    is that extremist groups who wanted the pressure on them from Pakistani and NATO
    troops on Pakistan's western front to be relieved, staged the attack in order
    to force Pakistan and India to move troops to their border.  I have no proof of
    this, but surely it is a theory that is more plausible than that RAW would be
    staging massive attacks against India, or that crazed people in the ISI are engaging
    in this out of sheer hatred for India.]  In any event, the \"wheels within
    wheels\" feel brings to mind Vikram Chandra's novel \"Sacred Games\", which is
    a great representation of this sort of vertigo.  Highly recommended.  With
    all due respect, I get the impression that there is not a single violent incident,
    not a single one, that some are willing to accept was the result of a violent
    Muslim extremist group.  That is, one seems to be willing to accept every sort
    of conspiracy and this-isn't-what-it-seems scenario -- EXCEPT that there are certain
    violent Muslim fanatics who are willing to engage in violence to achieve their
    ends.  I don't mean to sound hostile, but don't you find something implausible
    in that?  I mean there always seems to be the three step scenario: (1) How do
    we know they did it?  (2) If they did, they're probably in the pay of ____; (3)
    In any event, they are the responsibility of the CIA etc. for creating them during
    the Cold War.  I submit that these standards could be, and are, applied by those
    who wish to absolve Hindu extremist groups as well [Consider their story: The
    Congress, in a bid to deflect attention from its own national security failures
    -- there were 6-8 serial blast incidents in India BEFORE the 26/11 Mumbai attacks
    -- has invented the specter of Hindu terrorism, thereby also assuaging a Muslim
    vote bank, and simultaneously tarring the opposition BJP with the taint of association
    with terrorist groups; coincidentally, all this happens just 9-10 months prior
    to the national elections (and 3-4 months prior to important state elections).
    \ The \"confessions\" of Purohit are mostly due the technique known as \"narco-analysis\"
    in India -- a polite way of saying that the suspect is administered certain drugs/truth
    serums etc.  None of this evidence would be admissible in a court of law; and
    there are, as usual, allegations of torture as well.  The result is a Hindu extremist
    group that no-one seems to have heard of.  My point isn't that this is the right
    \"story\", but simply that this sort of narrative is common to all those who wish
    to absolve \"their\" group from x or y -- it consists of stringing together circumstantial
    evidence and facts, and then challenging anyone to disprove the narrative.  Of
    course it is like proving a negative: it is virtually impossible to prove that
    ISN'T the case.  Typically, extreme regard for judicial process is also involved:
    but hey, if everyone and everything can be manipulated and rendered fraudulent,
    why trust the courts?  (And of course, that is reserved for when and if the court
    returns a guilty verdict)  I might add that media accounts of \"evidence\" are
    dismissed, but media accounts that \"no evidence has been found\" are not being
    dismissed].  Forgive me \"agar mein kuch zyaada bol gaya\": likely it is because
    I have been in (far too) many of these discussions (i.e. not on CM), and I feel
    that while there is a lot of critical thinking about US policy, Indian and Pakistani
    government claims, the media, etc. (as there should be), there is not enough about
    Muslim extremism.  That is actually a pity, because we will never get anywhere
    if the only \"critics\" are the \"secular\" Muslims etc., who probably lack all
    credibility with believers.  Critical thinking cannot be about constructing a
    narrative of injured innocence on one's own part (just as critiquing Muslim extremists
    does not mean one is endorsing this or that \"official policy\".]  Re: \"His
    condemnation of things is very selective and based on a narrow agenda.\"  This
    is true for everyone, it is human nature.  For instance, I am more exercised about
    the pogrom about Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 than I am about Chinese government
    suppression of Uighur Muslims in Western China.  This reflects certain cultural,
    ethnic, political backgrounds and agendas that I am heir to.  Similarly, most
    Pakistanis are far more concerned about atrocities in Kashmir than East Pakistan
    (or heck, even FATA, some days it feels like!) So too with Husain: presumably
    he dislikes Muslim extremists, and highlights their atrocities more than others
    -- that doesn't mean that the atrocities he is in fact highlighting aren't occurring,
    or that he is somehow mercenary.  It's an unfair charge.  Aside on the 26/11
    attacks: I think the Pakistani government badly mishandled this.  The government
    initially adopted the line of: \"hey no one is pakistani and there is no evidence
    anyone was pakistani\", which IMO is stupid.  Perhaps it's the lawyer in me, but
    the real argument to have been made was \"whether anyone is Pakistani or not is
    irrelevant -- we condemn the attack and will cooperate with you to nail whoever
    is responsible.\"  Ultimately (after DAWN, Geo, and the Guardian, all reported
    that Qasab was in fact Pakistani), that is the sort of position the Pakistani
    government arrived at a few months later, but by then the damage had been done:
    from the Indian perspective, it seemed that the Pakistani government was stonewalling;
    and from the perspective of the Pakistani public, the fact that the government
    was seen to be changing its position damaged its credibility and made it seem
    like it was only doing so out of pressure (the government ultimately went with
    a more palatable narrative, that there is \"some connection\" between the Samjhauta
    Express blasts and the Mumbai attacks; without any word on what connection is
    there between Pakistani national Qasab, Hafiz Saeed (who was released by the court
    not because there was no evidence against him, but because the government had
    not framed charges against him; which raises suspicions that he has friends in
    very high places indeed in Pakistan); and the likes of Purohit and Abhinav Bharat
    extremists).  Note that my observation has nothing to do with who is responsible
    for those attacks: I just feel the Zardari government (and presumably the behind-the-scenes-military)
    acted like panicked amateurs, and that there was a smoother way to handle it from
    their end, and perhaps one that would have been less damaging to Indo-Pak relations.  I
    realize that I'm probably going around in circles on this thread, i.e. I am not
    making (or am unable to make) any new points to add to the ones discussed earlier.
    \ So I'll spare the patient CM-ers more on this thread.  Thanks all for your forbearance!"

    that's why after being mowed down by so many years of extremist

    extremism? Is extremism in the kind of religiosity being propagated or in the
    way it is propagated?   Blaming all ills under the sun on imperialism of
    this or that state, or on Green/Brown/Red/Yellow menace misses the point and neither
    I nor my community gets anywhere. I don't want to judge people's religiosity by
    their politics and vice-versa, but the so-called Islamic states, \"Islamic\" political
    parties, or \"Islamic\" businesses that pay lip service to Islam, in order to
    legitimize and market their self interested agendas devoid of any spiritual underpinning
    &amp; Islamic ethics are a mockery. I haven't read about the political vision
    of the these groups and if it offers much in terms of solutions, neither have
    I seen an evidence of their religious doctrine to be firmly grounded in Islamic
    jurisprudence. So far, I agree with Ali Allawi's stinging critique of both the
    \"Islamic States\" and \"Islamic\" political and militant groups."

  content: "\"OMG! The sky is falling!!! Some good points, but am I being unfair
    to Mr. Paracha's spin?\"  Mr.Paracha is Glen Beck of
    Pakistan. He does not even touch upon real issues faced by average Pakistani
    in daily life.There is a trend especially  in english dailies from Pakistan where
    almost half to two third space for OP-Eds, blogs is being used to create a reality
    that our religiosity is holding us back.The history and facts be damned. Any facts
    that stand in the way of this thesis are ignored. <i>This trend has consequently
    moulded a common mind-set and a social and cultural ground that has become almost
    voluntarily vulnerable to Islamist exploitation. This might answer the question
    as to why society at large goes up in arms after a drone attack whereas it remains
    awkwardly quiet every time a terrorist murders scores of common people in a suicide
    blast.</i>  Does this make any sense?  Common mind set?  Voluntarily vulnerable
    to \"Islamist exploitation\" ?   Comparing Drones attacks( a sophisticated
    remote killing machine,attacking a country against all international laws), to
    suicide bomber ( an act of extreme despair and clearly against the teachings of
    Islam)or homicide bomber as Fox would like to call it. While ignoring all pronouncements
    of muslim scholars against this crime(suicide attack).He does not want to understand
    the role our ruling classes (with the help of clergy) have in creating these desperate
    socio-economic situation where everything including human life is for sale and
    cheap.  I bet Paracha would be surprised if he visited Dallas on any given
    friday. He could find NAATS and recitation of Holy book on sound system of Indo-pak
    a grocery market run by Bengalis and could enjoy chicken Biryani at discount rate
    on friday afternoon after prayers."

  content: "Re: \"Qalandar.... Following are the questions that I wish to find answers
    to and discuss...Does one think of extremism as a religious or a political phenomenon? Is
    &ldquo;extremism&rdquo; is to be thought of in terms of
    politics of pushing an exclusivist religious/secularist ideology? Is a social
    movement that pushes religiosity or a particular form of religious paradigm through
    non-violent and non-political means to be considered extremism? If so, which religious
    development in the history of religions isn't extremism? Is
    extremism in the kind of religiosity being propagated or in the way it is propagated?\"  Jab
    bhi mein chorhna chahta hoon, ye mahaul mujhe khenchta hai :-)  I consider
    it a political phenomenon, but this is a political phenomenon that calls itself
    a religious phenomenon.  Thus, in a sense what I or you say about whether or not
    x or y \"is Islam\" (or is not) is hardly relevant: to the relevant actors, it
    is.  The question one must engage with is (assuming one is opposed to that ideology)
    how and under what circumstances this ideology gains greater legitimacy and commands
    increasing numbers of adherents.  The \"is this Islam or politics?\" debate becomes
    quite interesting because the prestige of this politics, the legitimacy, rests
    on it NOT presenting itself as \"normal\" politics, but as something that is \"simply
    Islam\" (which of course commands greater respect and legitimacy than anything
    else in a predominantly Muslim society).  To the extent this move is credible,
    it is a master-stroke: because opponents of the ideology are always forced on
    the back foot, into a defensive posture (\"hey we are not against Islam, we are
    only against x or y interpretation\").  In particular, the hardest hit are progressive
    voices, because they have to fight on two fronts: on the one hand, oppose the
    politics-that-says-it-isn't-politics; and yet do it in a way that avoids cooptation
    by outside elements (e.g. if they seem like the Trojan horse for Western interests,
    they will lack any credibility).    In sum, while I completely agree with
    those who say that \"Islamism\" and the politics that passes under that sign should
    not be confused with Islam, is about religion and not politics; it is simultaneously
    undeniable that this politics poses a challenge because it tries to remove itself
    from the realm of the political even as it is thoroughly political, thereby removing
    itself from the realm of debate.  e.g. Marxism cannot do that: it is explicitly
    political, and thus will always have opponents who speak the same language.  But
    \"political Islam\" of the present-day is often advanced by people who might not
    even recognize themselves as \"practicing politics\" (it also contributes to the
    opposite reaction: opponents themselves fall into the trap of saying that \"Islam
    is violent, intolerant\" etc., or \"Muslims are fanatics\"; without realizing
    that such reactions in fact testify to the victory of the \"Islamists\").  I think
    there is a lot of glibness on all sides here: the \"liberals\" cannot just say
    \"hey this is not Islam\" and end the debate, because it is clear that to many
    it IS compatible with Islam; nor can we just say \"it's all politics\", because
    it is politics with a difference; and right-wingers cannot just say \"hey this
    is what islam is\" because \"they\" don't seem to bother \"us\" unless we show
    up at their doorstep.  [I have not read Paracha's piece, but just from your
    quote, I do think there has been a proliferation of a dars-culture in Pakistan,
    India, the expatriate communities in the Gulf, etc., and in my experience a certain
    kind of bourgeois-ized view of Islam is presented, often by people who don't seem
    to me to have even the elementary qualification to give a dars. BUT, this is clearly
    a global contemporary phenomenon (certainly it is readily seen with Christian
    evangelists and Hindu godmen of all stripes), especially among religious traditions
    that don't have a centralized structure (such as Sunni Islam, evangelical Protestantism,
    Hinduism), so a discussion of it needs to look at the global picture, because
    IMO this sort of phenomenon \"says\" something about contemporary capitalism,
    media culture etc. -- to the extent that religion is today yet another kind of
    \"self-realization\", it is perhaps natural that it should take this form in a
    contemporary capitalist culture where \"self-realization\" is the ultimate good
    (that \"self-realization\" could come about in any way -- tattoos, shopping, religion,
    choice of career, but the point is that all of these are reducible to the same
    paradigm, and is thus something new as a historical matter), and is hardly \"about\"
    Islam, except in the sense that is the vehicle it must adopt in a particular society
    (I think of it as similar to McDonalds only selling veg food in Jaipur; that does
    not point to the victory of traditional \"Indian values\", but to the victory
    of McDonalds (with, potentially, the creation of some \"newness\" in Indian values)).  I
    would be remiss if I didn't add that the \"dars culture\" has one obvious benefit:
    from a feminist perspective, it has empowered many middle-class women and mobilized
    them (i.e. in contrast to traditional religiosity, where it was often difficult
    for women to adopt a public and assertive role).  The increased religiosity of
    the sort that Paracha seems to be talking about is not one that I am sympathetic
    to, but it has had important \"feminist\" effects (under-appreciated ones)...]"

    in that the very fact that the Indian and Pakistani papers are in English almost
    assures that the readership will be drawn from a relatively narrow range of socio-economic

    people who not only all know each other, but also know what each other will say

    to people complaining about the budget deficit on an Indian news channel: \"we
    can't afford\" the populist measures, one is told, ad infinitum, with no discussion
    of how it is that \"we\" apparently CAN afford starvation, dispossession, etc.

    but the two (mosque movement and MB) are not to be conflated to be the same. Dr.
    Mahmood discusses the liberal conception of agency which is to be recognized in

    has succeeded in expanding a woman's role in the mosque and consequently in the

  content: "Hmmm. I think I can empathize with people who write about such movements
    and how hard it is to keep terminology straight. We have so far used Islamism,
    political Islam, and extremism fairly interchangeably. Are these terms interchangeable?
      A very interesting essay by Alastair Crooke http://www.digitalnpq.org/articles/global/368/06-02-2009/alastair_crooke \"Disorientated
    and demoralized, the Islamic community in the early 20th century was under siege
    from enforced secularism in Turkey, Iran and elsewhere. With Marxism filtering
    away its younger members, it began a journey of discovery. It sought a solution
    to its problems by finding a new \"Self.\"  Islamists returned to the Quran
    for insights. The Quran is not a blueprint for politics or a state: It is, as
    it states frequently, nothing new. The Quran is a \"reminder\" of old truths,
    already known to us all. One of which is that for humans to live together successfully
    society must practice compassion, justice and equity.   This insight lies
    at the root of political Islam. It is a principle that represents a complete inversion
    of the \"Great Transformation.\" Instead of the pre-eminence of the market to
    which other social and community objectives are subordinated, the making of a
    society based on compassion, equity and justice becomes the overriding objective
    -- to which other objectives, including markets, are subordinated.  It is
    revolutionary in another aspect: Instead of the individual being the organizational
    principle around which politics, economics and society are shaped, the Western
    paradigm again is inverted. It is the collective welfare of the community in terms
    of such principles -- rather than the individual -- that becomes the litmus of
    political achievement.  In short, Islamists are re-opening an old debate
    -- one that is at the root of both Western and Islamic philosophy. Posed by Plato,
    that debate questions the purpose of politics.\""

     &ldquo;In Globalized Islam, Roy tries to explain why jihadist
    Islam resonates in the communities in which it does. He sees the spread of jihadist
    Islam today as \"a consequence of and [a] reaction to sociological changes,\"
    rather than as \"evidence of the permanence of unchanging values\" (the culturalist
    view) or as a direct historical consequence of the Saudis' and Reagan's support
    for the Wahhabi project (Kepel's view). Roy distinguishes contemporary neofundamentalists
    from traditional fundamentalists, such as Wahhabis who have tried \"to delink
    Islam from ethnic cultures\" for centuries and have everywhere \"fought against
    local Islams\"--\"Sufism in South Asia, marabouts in North Africa, specific music
    and rituals everywhere,\" and even Shafism, Hanafism, and other historical schools
    of sharia.  For Roy, neofundamentalist Islam is \"born-again Islam\" and
    strictly a product of the diaspora. Islamic religious debate is no longer monopolized
    by the learned ulema (teachers); as they have turned to the Internet, the neofundamentalists
    have also become tulaab (students). As a result, \"religion has been secularized,
    not in the sense that it is under the scrutiny of modern sciences, but to the
    extent that it is debated outside any specific institutions or corporations.\"
    With the traditional ethnic community left behind, \"the disappearance of traditional
    values ... [has laid] the groundwork for re-Islamisation,\" which has largely
    become an individual project. \"Islamic revivalism goes hand in hand\" with a
    modern trend: the \"culture of the self.\" The growing individualization of
    religious practices has prompted believers to create a new community that transcends
    strict geography. The consequences of these changes have been contradictory. Those
    who have succeeded in reconciling the self with religion have tended to embrace
    a \"liberal\" or \"ethical\" version of Islam; those who have not have been prone
    to embrace \"neofundamentalist Salafism.\" Meanwhile, the quest \"to build a universal
    religious identity, de-linked from any specific culture,\" has come at a price,
    because such an Islam is \"by definition an Islam oblivious to its own history.\"
    As a result, \"the quest for a pure Islam [has] entail[ed] also an impoverishment
    of its content,\" Roy writes, and the ironic consequence of this quest is \"secularization,
    but in the name of fundamentalism.\"  This transformation has had particularly
    radical consequences for the Muslims of Europe, setting them apart from their
    cousins in the Middle East. According to Roy, political Islam is bifurcated between
    Islamist parties in Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and Islamists
    in the diaspora. Because in the Middle East, Islamist parties have mobilized in
    response to particular state policies, by the end of the 1990s, most Islamist
    movements had become \"more nationalist than Islamist.\" As a consequence of their
    political integration, \"violence related to Islam has been decreasing in the
    Middle East since 1996.\"  Islamist violence has increased outside the Middle
    East, however. The question is why, and why specifically in the West? The answer,
    Roy ventures, is that the violence of al Qaeda is politically, not religiously,
    inspired. After all, \"al Qaeda did not target St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, but
    the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It targeted modern imperialism, as the
    ultra-leftists of the late 1960s and 1970s did with less success.\" Furthermore,
    the cliche \"that in Islam there is no difference between politics and religion
    ... works in favor of the political,\" making it easier to redefine the core content
    of religion and subordinate it to a political project, as the jihadists have done.  Even
    the contemporary notion of jihad is a marked departure--perhaps even a rupture--from
    its traditional forerunner. It too has been reinvented according to neofundamentalist
    principles: personalized, secularized, and turned into a political tool. Roy points
    out that, contrary to Western popular belief, traditional jihad is not one of
    the five pillars of Islam and that it has long been understood as a defensive,
    collective duty. But modern radicals now hail jihad as \"a permanent and individual
    duty\" to fight the West to the death. This modern understanding of jihad goes
    hand in hand with a revamped notion of community, or umma: no longer bound by
    traditional solidarity, the umma is the \"reconstructed\" product of the \"free
    association of militants committed to the same ideal.\" The umma now plays the
    same role as did the proletariat for Trotskyist and leftist groups in the 1960s:
    it is 'an imaginary and therefore silent community that gives
    legitimacy to the small group pretending to speak in its name.'&rdquo;"

  content: 'On the "deracinated" religiosity of the disapora, that dovetails with
    my experience as well.  One often meets American Muslims (of desi origin/ethnicity)
    who: (a) look down on Islamic practices in their parents'' homeland, as impure/corrupted/not
    real Islam, etc.; and (b) seem to see Islam itself as a kind of ethnicity (perhaps
    influenced by the Jewish immigrant experience).  I am persuaded by the distinction
    drawn between "traditional" and "modern" forms of Islam that seek to de-link it
    from "the local", but the two are also linked by way of the petrodollar: i.e.
    that spending advantage, the mosques that it has built, and the ideology it can
    propagate, gives it a vigor and advantage that the other sorts of traditional
    Islams have found it difficult to match.  Thus traditional and modern "fundamentalism"
    (using Roy''s term, although I do not like it) aren''t the same, but there is
    a link, rendering the passage from one to the other, plausible.  The figure of
    Osama bin Laden is symbolically quite apt, inasmuch as he touches upon (what Roy
    would consider) both the traditional and the modern.'

    the history of "revivalist" movements all over (from Hindu groups in India; to
    the Buddhist messianic cults in Burma that sprang up to oppose British colonialism)
    shows that this too has a wider history than merely the Islamic one.  [And, in
    each case, the impact of colonialism has played a huge role.]

    and institutions? Yet, this continues to go unrecorded and unnoticed in our narrative.
    Suddenly, some of us are concerned about poverty because that seems to be driving
    people to suicide bombings. We want to deal with poverty because it has begun
    to hurt us. Suddenly, we are realising that children are sent to seminaries, our
    jihad factories, because they come from poor families. All of a sudden we \"genuinely\"
    feel that poverty needs to be tackled. Why? Because poverty is hurting our own
    freedoms, which come to us entirely because of our property relations with the
    rest of society.   What we fail to understand is that both poverty and religious
    fanaticism in Pakistan are contradictions within the state that have deliberately
    and carefully been nurtured over the years. Religious fanaticism can feed on poverty,
    but poverty cannot cause it. A suicide bombing is not the product of a contract
    but of a worldview cultivated with a conscious effort. Our state has for long
    actively supported that worldview, which has found poverty of some to be a willing
    partner. Are we willing to change the nature of the state that has caused all
    this? Do we even want to? \"  http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=187421"

      [...] \"The Israel Syndrome, whose characteristics are the state of siege
    and of the reversal of the power equation on the level of perception and symbolism,
    has come fully into play: The Other is no longer criticizing our policies, he
    is negating our existence; he detests our values, our very civilization. He must
    no longer be held responsible for his acts alone but for his hatred, his nihilism,
    his madness and &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; his beliefs and
    his religion.  With Fear We Are All Victims | The first tragic consequence
    of the ideology of fear is to transform all societies and their members into victims.
    While in the West the idea of a civilization under threat gains currency, we can
    observe the same emotional reflexes, shaped by fear and victimhood, in majority
    Muslim societies, and even in the Muslim communities established in Europe and
    in the United States: &ldquo;They&rdquo; do not like Islam
    and Muslims; &ldquo;they&rdquo; have singled us out, discriminate
    against us; &ldquo;they&rdquo; are openly racist and xenophobic.
    &ldquo;Their&rdquo; war against &ldquo;Islamic

    same feelings, everywhere the same attitudes. Before our eyes an ideology is emerging,
    one that transforms us into &ldquo;victims&rdquo; incapable
    of viewing the Other except as a potential threat. Because we are colonized by
    fear, it has become impossible for us to enter into the Other's
    reasoning, even to hear him or, in the most humane sense, understand his distress

  content: "@ Qalandar http://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/roy.htm \"Parallel
    to the growing Islamist political contest of the seventies and eighties, a process
    of conservative Islamization has been pervasive among the Muslim societies, which
    means, among other things, more veiled women in the streets and more shariat in
    state law. This Islamization is a consequence of deliberate state policy as well
    as a social phenomenon. Confronted with the Islamist opposition during the eighties,
    many Muslim states, even when officially secular, endeavored to promote a brand
    of conservative Islam and to organize an \"official Islam.\" The first part of
    the program was quite a success, but state control has never been effective. In
    all these countries the impact of the development of a network of religious schools
    was the same: graduates holding a degree in religious sciences are now entering
    the labor market and tend, of course, to advocate the Islamization of education
    and law in order to get better job opportunities.     Three elements characterize
    these groups (well embodied by the Taliban/Osama bin Laden coalition). First,
    they combine political and militant jihad against the West with a very conservative
    definition of Islam, closer to the tenets of Saudi Wahhabism than to the official
    ideology of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nowhere is their conservatism more obvious
    than in their attitude toward women. While the Islamists strongly advocated women\"s
    education and political participation (with the condition of wearing a veil and
    attending single-sex schools), the neofundamentalists want to ban any female presence
    in public life. They are also strongly opposed to music, the arts, and entertainment.
    Contrary to the Islamists, they do not have an economic or social agenda. They
    are the heirs to the conservative Sunni tradition of fundamentalism, obsessed
    by the danger of a loss of purity within Islam through the influence of other
    religions. They stress the implementation of shariat as the sole criterion for
    an Islamic State and society. This strict Sunnism also turned very anti-Shi\"a.
    This anti-Shi\"a bias was revived at the end of the eighties as a consequence
    of the growing influence of the Saudi Wahhabism and gave way to a low-intensity
    civil war between Shi\"as and Sunnis in Pakistan, reflected in Afghanistan by
    the mass killing of Shi\"as after the take-over of Mazar-i Sharif by the Taliban
    in August 1998. But they also are becoming strongly anti-Christian and anti-Jewish.
    In fact, they believe that Israel, the U.S. and Iran are united to destroy \"true
    Islam.\" \"  [...]\"In fact, this new brand of supranational neo-fundamentalism
    is more a product of contemporary globalization than of the Islamic past. Using
    two international languages (English and Arabic), traveling easily by air, studying,
    training and working in many different countries, communicating through the Internet
    and cellular phones, they think of themselves as \"Muslims\" and not as citizens
    of a specific country. \""

    Activism: Deoband, Tablighis, and Talibs Barbara D. Metcalf http://essays.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/metcalf.htm
      \"Deobandis, Talibs, and Tablighis demonstrate pragmatic responses to
    the varying environments in which they find themselves. The Taliban surely represent
    an exceptional case both in their rigor - criticized for example in relation to
    women even by leading `ulama of the JUI - and in the deal they struck with Arab
    extremists, who were like them in embracing Islamic rituals and social norms,
    but so unlike them in their vision of global jihad. Even the Taliban, arguably,
    had moderate voices, as well as pragmatism in their alliances that might one day
    have made their society more acceptable in terms of international standards had
    that possibility not been foreclosed by the attacks of 11 September and the American
    'war on terrorism.'\" [...] \"Aside from Deoband's enduring influence, it exemplifies
    a pattern, represented in general terms in a range of Islamic movements outside
    South Asia as well, of a pattern of \"traditionalist\" cultural renewal on the
    one hand coupled with political adaptability on the other. This tradition, seen
    over time and across a wide geographic area, illustrates that there are widespread
    patterns of Islamic a-politicism that foster a modus vivendi with democratic and
    liberal traditions. It also demonstrates, most notably in the teaching and missionary
    dimensions of their activities, that the goals and satisfactions that come from
    participation in Islamic movements may well have little to do with opposition
    or resistance to non-Muslims or \"the West.\" Their own debates or concerns may
    well focus on other Muslims, an internal, and not an external \"Other\" at all.
    And what they offer participants may be the fulfillment of desires for individual
    empowerment, transcendent meaning, and moral sociality that do not engage directly
    with national or global political life at all.\" [...] \"What is clear is that
    the formally a-political missionary tours, gatherings in local mosques and homes,
    and annual gatherings continue to be the routine of the movement, one that clearly
    offers meaning and dignity to many who participate. In themany goals fostered
    by these movements - social, psychological, moral, and spiritual - as well as
    in the political strategies adopted with such virtuosity, movements, in the end,
    turn out to be less distinctive than either they or outsiders often assume they
    are.\""

  content: "Qalandar,  I loved your post and have been thinking about the term
    \"liminal.\" I have not read, and don't know, much about liminality or what the
    term means and signifies (Reading suggestions are welcome). Is liminality/permanent
    liminality the same as syncretism? Or does it, like syncretism (as far as I understand
    the term) imply that a certain religious practice or an observant Muslim (for
    instance) is not completely/\"purely\" Muslim.   Another Metcalf piece that's
    somewhat relevant to your post. http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part0_metcalfintro.html
     [...] \"ironically, the singling out of &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo;
    reinforces the image of an (unspoken) separate, non-Indian, negative &ldquo;Islam.&rdquo;
    As noted above, this emphasis may feed into a Hindutva notion that Muslims are
    really Hindu. It more clearly risks the assumption, evident especially in the
    introduction, that Muslims who preserve the scholarly tradition stand outside
    what is Indian. \"  [...] \"Now, on to brief comments about the work of
    several other scholars that help, even if one limits the discussion to Sufis,
    in getting out of the &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo; box.  
    \      I might begin with my own study of Deoband, published almost a quarter
    of a century back. I came to the topic of a new kind of modern organization for
    transmitting Islamic learning in the colonial period out of a desire to challenge
    the notion that only the Westernized who knew a metropolitan language were engaged,
    in the colonial period, in projects of intellectual and social reform. But in
    the course of my study of the scholarly leadership, I learned two things relevant
    to the issue of syncretism. One, made real through reading letters, notebooks,
    volumes of charms, and records of dreams of these Islamic scholars, was the extent
    to which they were immersed in the initiatory chains, disciplinary practices,
    and traditions generally of the Sufi orders. They were holy men as well as scholars,
    and their influence derived from both these roles. They were, to be sure, reformers,
    and part of that reform extended to issues surrounding the Sufi tomb shrines.
    But they couched their opposition to certain practices in terms of basic morality
    — avoiding display, showing off, eschewing doctrinal error
    (shirk, bida`, imputing partners to God) — not in terms of
    following Hindu practice. Their targets were internal: misguided Sufis, the Shi`a.
    Moreover, to the extent they were devoted to the elders, traveled to their tombs,
    invoked stories of their holiness, and so forth, they themselves cherished the
    tombs. As my former student Warren Fusfeld pointed out, moreover, in relation
    to the l9th century Delhi Naqshbandis, they did so on the grounds that this was
    their tradition, never with the argument that such practices were conducive to
    harmony with Hindus. They followed these practices because they were continuous
    with a sanctified past (1987). It continues to fascinate me that so much of colonial-period
    Islamic reform is intra-Muslim — yet the scholarly common sense
    that it must be anti-Hindu, drawing lines between Hindus and Muslims, always prevails.\"
      [...]\"In concluding these thoughts on the &ldquo;syncretic,&rdquo;
    I return to van der Veer — my final story —
    and his material about a Gujarati Rifa'i tomb (published in
    the Journal of Asian Studies  in the 90s). What is interesting about this study
    is that it includes extensive material on the Hindus who frequent the shrine,
    an element missing, for example, from the Amin study of Ghazi Miyan. At this tomb
    in Surat, the `urs is widely attendend, and it is understood as a day of powerful
    blessing. The descendant of the saint replaces the cover on the tomb and smears
    it with sandalwood. The disciples play with swords and pierce themselves, part
    of their practices toward inducing ecstatic experiences. Hindus are in fact the
    majority of those in attendance, not least because these practices have come into
    question on the part of many Muslims. But the Hindus who come do so on their own
    terms. They call the shrine a Samadhi (a Hindu saint in meditation), not a dargah.
    They do not participate in the activities inducing a trance or hal. They cultivate
    no relationship with the living descendant of the saint, and thus have no exposure
    to the discourse of Sufism. They do not join the Rifa'i who
    combine their procession with congregational prayer, the descendant of the saint
    serving as imam (so that for the Muslims present, the tomb does not exist in isolation
    from other Islamic practices).           The Hindus attribute power to the
    saint, but do so specifically in relation to illnesses — above
    all, to misfortunes caused by spirits. For them, Muslims are held to be closer
    to a world of spirits and demons, and able to master it, like untouchables, who
    can also be specialists in exoricism. Saint worship is for them in that sense
    a lower and impure practice. There is no evidence of any conversion to Islam,
    nor of participation in any of the dimensions of the Sufi tradition other than
    healing and magic; nor, given the tensions about Islam, would they even talk of
    possible substantial influence on non-Muslims. \""

    I have not read, and don't know, much about liminality or what
    the term means and signifies (Reading suggestions are welcome). Is liminality/permanent
    liminality the same as syncretism?\"  To be honest, I prefer \"marginal\"
    and \"liminal\" to \"syncretic\" for basically the same reasons Metcalf mentions
    in her first paragraph in your most recent comment.  IMO, marginal/liminal are
    more neutral and less essentialist, inasmuch as they point to the \"subaltern\"
    status of various traditions, how they are not considered part of the mainstream
    discourse, etc. -- whereas \"syncretic\" suggests to me that something that is
    Islam is being mixed with something that is not (one thereby falls into the essentialist
    discourse of the orthodox; the secular \"moderns\"; as well as Islamophobes).
    \   As for suggested reading, I can't really offer up anything like a theoretical
    recommendation, but I do recommend the works of Sikand (\"Sacred Spaces\") Shail
    Mayaram (\"Resisting Regimes\"), for two relatively recent books on the experience
    of some communities.  You might also want to check out Amitav Ghosh's novel \"The
    Hungry Tide\".  Mayaram's is a rigorous study of the Meo of the Mewat region;
    Ghosh's novel is set in the Sundarbans of Bengal; Sikand's book has the obvious
    (if implicit) aim of contrasting \"tolerant\"/pluralistic forms of worship with
    the \"bad\" Hinduism/Islam, and can come across as an exercise in liminal tourism
    (each chapter deals with a different site).  Nevertheless, I find the book to
    be very useful and significant, especially inasmuch as it talks about forms of
    worship that don't get much play.   [Disclaimer: Yoginder is an e-friend of mine,
    and a great guy; his books are far too expensive in the USA, but can be obtained
    from India quite inexpensively (he also has a history of the Tablighi Jamaat);
    in general, if you google him, you'll find a number of essays that he has written.
    \ Sikand also performs the valuable service of translating the Urdu writings of
    certain Islamic scholars in order to disseminate them to a wider audience.]  I
    guess the Vaudeville book is also one I find useful: \"Myths, Saints and Legends
    in Medieval India.\"  Heck, although far from a concern with \"liminal\" communities
    per se, anything by Barbara Metcalf, and Robinson's \"The Ulama of Farangi Mahall\".
    \ Finally, I find Nicholas Dirks' book \"Castes of Mind\" to be very useful (and
    pertinent to this discussion), although I know some people see him as espousing
    an extremist who lays modern caste-ism on the doors of the British (I don't think
    that's a fair reading of Dirks' thesis, but enough have  made the point (most
    recently, among stuff I've read, John Darwin in \"After Tamerlane\") that I would
    be remiss if I didn't mention it.  I know sepoy is getting ready for his move,
    but I imagine he is a far better person to offer recommendations on this issue..."

  content: "Re: \"On the &ldquo;deracinated&rdquo; religiosity
    of the disapora, that dovetails with my experience as well. One often meets American
    Muslims (of desi origin/ethnicity) who: (a) look down on Islamic practices in
    their parents' homeland, as impure/corrupted/not real Islam,
    etc.; and (b) seem to see Islam itself as a kind of ethnicity (perhaps influenced
    by the Jewish immigrant experience). \" *****  \"Today's religious revival
    is first and foremost marked by the uncoupling of culture and religion, whatever
    the religion may be. This explains the affinities between American Protestant
    fundamentalism and Islamic Salafism: both reject culture, philosophy, and even
    theology in favour of a scriptural reading of the sacred texts and an immediate
    understanding of truth through individual faith, to the detriment of educational
    and religious institutions.   The first point, essentially linked to the
    issue of Islam in Europe, is the uncoupling of Islam, on the one hand, and a given
    territory and culture, on the other. In countries with a Muslim tradition, both
    the believer and the non-believer, or the less convinced believer, experience
    religion as some sort of cultural given: by and large their society organizes
    and provides the space for religious practice. It is easy to fast during Ramadan
    in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt, even if a person does not want to. Anybody
    wishing to observe Ramadan can do so without any problem, as society is organized
    around it for as long as necessary, and there are even instances of societies
    like Iran, where, in fact, very few people practice it, but where, officially,
    everything is done in order for believers to observe Ramadan.\"  [...]\"In
    our contemporary world we are now witnessing the uncoupling of religion and culture,
    in other words, contemporary believers put far more stress on faith, on spiritual
    experience, on individual and personal rediscovery of religion, than on legacy,
    culture, transmission, authority, and theology.  Today, we see forms of
    religious revival leading to the \"born again\" phenomenon, in other words, people
    are born again into their religion. It is perhaps the most striking phenomenon
    of contemporary religiosity in all denominations. It is these \"born again\" believers
    who now define religious belief, for the large part, and not what we call the
    sociological believers. A born again believer is someone who rediscovers faith
    and decides that from then on his or her life will be put totally in the perspective
    of this rediscovered faith, in other words, he or she will rebuild his or her
    self in his or her relationship to that faith. This is what I call 'religiosity.'\"  [...]\"Therefore,
    what we have is not a contradiction, but two totally different trends: one is
    the crisis of religions as institutions and cultures, the other is the return
    of religiosity. The return of religiosity acts against religion. It is very visible,
    for instance, among the charismatic fundamentalist protestant movements, where
    faith is first of all experienced as an individual experience and a break with
    tradition. Today, religious revival everywhere takes the form of a break with
    tradition, rather than a form of continued legacy.\"  [...]\"What we today
    label as Islamic fundamentalism, the re-Islamization, is happening not only in
    the Western world, but also in a lot of Islamic countries, under the same conditions
    as the revival of religious belief in Christianity, be it Protestant or Catholic.
    Therefore, far from witnessing an expansion of Middle Eastern and traditional
    Islam, which would assert itself against an equally traditional Christianity,
    what we are seeing is the globalization and Westernization of Islam from within,
    including in its most fundamentalist forms.\"  http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2007-05-03-roy-en.html"

    over a boundary drawn by a British bureaucrat without any participation by those

    1956 Suez.  These examples show just how voluntary British voluntariness was (as
    late as 1939 there were basically NO SIGNS that the British were preparing to
    leave India).  The real remarkable achievement here is how the Brits have (beyond
    all other empires, including those of other Western European powers) won the PR

    read, relevant to Qalandar's aforementioned comment. http://www.altmuslimah.com/a/b/a/3213/  \"This
    process is 'glocalisation'; consumers take
    the globalised artifact (Barbie) and make it local (Fulla). It is a positive step

    been a bit skeptical about the glocalisation argument. McDonalds usually trots
    it out to make the claim that they &ldquo;respect&rdquo;
    Muslim cultures because they offer halal Big Macs. In the case of Barbie dolls,
    I think it is important to realize that while dolls like Fulla and Razanne do
    offer an alternative to Barbie, the dolls remain inherently consumerist and construct
    their own discourse of femininity.   Take Razanne, for example. While she
    comes in different 'colors' to represent
    different ethnicities, all variations of the doll have exactly the same features,
    with only slight dissimilarities in their complexions. Fulla is created in the
    same factory in China as Barbie, and looks almost like Barbie's
    twin sister with larger eyes and a slightly darker complexion. Thus, the Western
    concept of beauty which was first introduced though Barbie, remains unchanged
    when it comes to these ethnic dolls. In the end, glocalization isn't
    about finding the 'agency' of consumers
    in globalization — it's about Barbie done
    differently to sell more stuff.   To a large extent, these dolls are being
    treated as marketing tools in order to sell Islam. Fulla has sparked a craze in
    the Middle East; you can find Fulla chewing gum, bags and bicycles, matching clothes,
    and a matching pink prayer rug for her young owner. A toy-store owner in Syria
    was quoted in &ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; as saying
    &ldquo;If you've got a TV in the house, it's
    Fulla all the time. The parents complain about the expense, but Fulla gives girls
    a more Islamic character to emulate, and parents want that.&rdquo; Forgive
    me if I want something other than a doll to teach my (potential) daughter my religious
    and cultural values.  A writer at &ldquo;The Guardian&rdquo;
    aptly sums it up , &ldquo;For parents it will be the same story regardless:
    an empty wallet and a houseful of small plastic people with fixed smiles and molded

    probably gives undue space&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;an entire chapter&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to
    the liberalisation of the economy since 1991, material that is widely available
    elsewhere, she might have said a little more about the homogenising tendencies
    of modern Hinduism, and the way local and regional cults and variants are falling
    out of favour as faith becomes more centralised. Small devtas and devi cults giving
    way instead to the national hyper-masculine hero deities, especially Lord Krishna
    and Lord Rama, a process scholars call the 'Rama-fication'
    of Hinduism.  For this tendency, the best source remains Romila Thapar's
    essay Syndicated Hinduism. Here, Thapar shows how, since the mid-19th century,
    reformers such as Vivekananda have systemised Hinduism into a relatively centralised
    nationalist ideology that now increasingly resembles the very different structures
    of the Semitic religions its more extreme adherents tend to abhor. &ldquo;The
    model,&rdquo; writes Thapar, &ldquo;is in fact that of
    Islam and Christianity...worship is increasingly congregational and the introduction
    of sermons on the definition of a good Hindu and Hindu belief and behaviour are
    becoming common and register a distinct change from earlier practice.&rdquo;
    According to Thapar, this homogenising process is accelerating: &ldquo;The
    emergence of a powerful middle-class,&rdquo; she believes, has created
    a desire for a &ldquo;uniform, monolithic Hinduism, created to serve
    its new requirements&rdquo;. This new Hinduism masquerades as the revival
    of something ancient, but it is really &ldquo;a new creation, created
    to support the claims of [Hindu] majoritarianism.&rdquo;  Ironically,
    there are strong parallels in the way this new Hinduism is standardising faith
    to what is happening in South Asian Islam. There too, the local is tending to
    give way to the national as the cults of local Sufi saints&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the
    warp and woof of popular Islam in India for centuries&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;loses
    ground to a more standardised, middle-class and textual form of Islam, imported
    from the Gulf and propagated by the the Wahabis, Deobandis and Tablighis in their
    madrasas.  Today, as a result, the great Sufi shrines of the region find
    themselves in a position much like that of the great sculptured cathedrals and
    saints' tombs of northern Europe five hundred years ago, on
    the eve of the Reformation. As in 16th century Europe, the reformers and puritans
    are on the rise, distrustful of music, images, festivals and the devotional superstitions
    of saints' shrines. As in Europe, they look to the text alone
    for authority, and recruit the bulk of their supporters from the newly literate
    urban middle-class, who looked down on what they see as the corrupt superstitions
    of the illiterate peasantry.  There is a similar if more gradual process
    at work in Hindu India: researching my Nine Lives, I found tantriks in West Bengal
    who lived in fear of Marxist 'anti-superstition committees',
    which beat up tantrik babas they accuse of bring perverts, drug addicts, alcoholics,
    even cannibals. Everywhere, the deeply embedded syncretic, pluralistic folk traditions
    that continue to defy the artificial boundaries of modern political identities
    are finding it difficult to compete with the homogenising mainstream.\""

  content: "Related to Dalrymple's piece:  A 'Hyper-Masculinised' Islam?:  http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?222639
       \"I grew up in an upper-middle class Muslim family in a small North Indian
    town. My father had first studied for a few years at the Firangi Mahal, the famous
    Sunni Muslim seminary at Lucknow, then gone on to study in a government highschool.
    Our family had some other ties too with the Firangi Mahal, and one particular
    former classmate of my father was a frequent visitor at our house. But I didn't
    learn my religion from my father or his friends. I learned it from Apa and Ammi,
    my mother and grandmother, respectively. I never saw my father observe the requirement
    of daily prayers until he was on his deathbed. But Apa and Ammi never missed any
    of the five daily prayers; neither did Mama, our beloved nanny, who had come as
    a young widow to work for my mother, almost as a part of her dowry.    Ammi
    taught me how to pray; she also had me read to her from two books. One had stories
    about the many Biblical prophets that the Muslims also revere, the other was a
    wonderful biography of the Prophet Muhammad, especially written for children.
    A maulvi came every day to teach me how to vocalise the Qur'an. I 'read' several
    sections of the holy book, and memorised some twenty or so shorter s&Atilde;&ordm;ras
    in order to perform the daily prayers. I was encouraged to pray, but no one forced
    me. I prayed when I liked, and I liked it when I prayed.\"    [...]\"The
    more I thought about the matter the clearer something became to me: the crucial
    thing was that I had learned my religion from the women in my family while the
    two young men had learned it from their fathers or from the men at the local mosques.
      I grew up observing the Islam of the women, which was practiced by them
    without any direct influence of a male member of the family or any male outsider.
    It included the shari'a rituals of prayer and fasting but also many other expressions
    of devotion and piety. It included celebrations of saints, remembrances of dead
    elders, recitations of religious verses, and a whole lot more. What was most important
    about these practices, as I only much later realized, was that they did not reflect
    any self-consciousness that was imbued with power and authority.    On the
    contrary, they expressed, on the part of their practitioners, a profound sense
    of humility and need. I should perhaps emphasize the first word. Humility before
    God and His elect was definitely the strongest impression I received from the
    religious acts of my grandmother, mother, and the other women in the family. There
    was never about them a sense of being someone special before God as Muslims; in
    fact, for them being a Muslim meant that one was humble and uncertain about one's
    final fate where God was concerned. No doubt that attitude was also connected,
    as I see only now, to their own position in the household as women. No matter
    how great a control they had in the zan&Atilde;&iexcl;na and in family matters,
    the bottom line for them was to accept what the men decided. That said, it was
    still true that during the formative years of their children's lives, when both
    girls and boys lived in the zan&Atilde;&iexcl;na, the women played a very significant
    role. \""

  content: "Excerpts from:  The Building of a Docile Islam in Britain: How not
    to Prevent Violent Exremism http://conflictsforum.org/CoR/CulturesOfResistance-03.pdf
      [UK Government] believes that by selectively directing resources at 'moderate'
    Muslim organizations to carry out community development and 'anti-radicalisation'
    work, it can empower them to unite around 'shared British values'
    to isolate the 'extremists'. With hundreds
    of millions of pounds of funding, the Prevent programme has come to redefine the
    relationship between government and around two million British citizens who are
    Muslim. Their 'hearts and minds' are now
    the target of an elaborate structure of surveillance, mapping, engagement and
    propaganda.  [...] What we found in our research was that there are strong
    reasons for thinking that the Prevent programme, in effect, constructs the Muslim
    population as a 'suspect community', fosters
    social divisions among Muslims and others, encourages tokenism, facilitates violations
    of privacy and professional norms of confidentiality, discourages local democracy
    and is counter-productive in reducing the risk of political violence. Moreover,
    there is evidence that the Prevent programme has been used to establish one of
    the most elaborate systems of surveillance ever seen in Britain. [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]The
    aim was to reduce the circulation of &ldquo;extremist ideas&rdquo;
    and tackle the widespread discontent and disaffection which extremists were thought
    to exploit. This was to be achieved by strengthening the hand of moderate Muslim
    leaders through government contact and targeted capacity building.  [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]The
    question we pose here is whether freedom and confidence for the majority can be
    enabled by imposing a lack of freedom and confidence on a minority. [&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]
    The problem with attempting to mobilise all these Muslims against 'extremism'
    is that it, in effect, constructs Muslims into a 'suspect community'
    in which the failure of Muslim individuals or organisations to comply with this
    mobilization makes them suspect in the eyes of the counter-terrorist system and
    shifts them from the bottom layer of 'mainstream Muslims'
    to the middle layer of extremists. However, Muslims may want to avoid participating
    in the government's Prevent programme for a number of reasons
    which have nothing to do with support for political violence.  For Muslims
    organizations that are able to present themselves as 'moderate',
    significant financial and symbolic resources are being offered by central and
    local government. The danger is that the distinction between 'moderate'
    and 'extremist' is flexible enough to be
    exploited by government to marginalize those who are critical of its policies.
    And the use of government funding to promote particular interpretations of religious
    texts is potentially dangerous.  The terms 'moderate'
    and 'extremist' are at times defined in
    practice by the degree to which Muslims support or oppose central government or
    local authority policies.  The category of 'moderate Muslims'
    is at times defined theologically, leading to the potential danger of government
    sponsorship for its preferred religious trends. Extremism is seen by the government
    as a 'twisted reading' or misreading of
    Islam that justifies terrorism. To counter this extremism, the Prevent programme
    seeks to identify and empower moderate Muslims who can offer an alternative reading
    of Islam.  In Bradford, the Council of Mosques has been supported by Prevent
    funding of &Acirc;&pound;80,000 from the dclg's community leadership
    fund in 2008/09 to develop a teaching resource for madrassahs known as Nasiha.
    Much of the resource is an impressive attempt to introduce key religious concepts.
    There is a perception, however, that, on occasion, the resource might appear too
    eager to interpret the original Islamic sources as having meanings useful to the
    Prevent programme. For example, verses are interpreted as meaning that &ldquo;the
    root cause of extremism, racism and bullying is hatred&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and
    all three can destroy a community&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; Hatred can also lead to

    leaders for our religion&rdquo;."

  content: "[cntd.] The perception that the government is sponsoring Muslim organisations
    on the basis of theological criteria&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for example, holding Sufis
    to be more favourable than Salafis [an orientation of Islam that seeks literal
    emulation of the early Muslim community and a literal interpretation of the Koran
    and Hadith]&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;runs counter to the secular separation of Church
    and state, even though such a separation is itself upheld as a marker of moderation
    which Muslims should aspire to. As Asma Jahnangir, the United Nations'
    Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, pointed out in her 2008 report
    on the uk, &ldquo;it is not the Government's role
    to look for the 'true voices of Islam' or
    of any other religion of belief. Since religions or communities of belief are
    not homogenous entities it seems advisable to acknowledge and take into account
    the diversity of voices&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; The contents of a religion or belief
    should be defined by the worshippers themselves.  There is also a risk of
    discovering extremists where none exist, if an interpretative framework based
    on the simple binary of 'moderate' and 'extremist'
    is imposed on the complex and dynamic picture of Muslim religious life. For example,
    since the 1990s, a major trend among young Muslims has been identification with
    the global ummah as a third way alternative to either assimilating into what many
    perceive to be a hostile society or following their parents'
    religio-cultural traditions, which are bound up with South Asian languages, poetry
    and 'folk' practices such as reverence for
    holy men or pirs. The emphasis is thus on purifying oneself from these cultural
    accretions which are seen as contaminating the Islamic message. This 'return'
    to the original Islamic texts and a global version of Islam is often seen as a
    Salafist precursor to extremism although it is more likely to lead to new kinds
    of positive engagement with British society.   The basis for this theological
    and cultural approach to preventing violent extremism is twofold. First, there
    is the idea that terrorist radicalisation is rooted in religio-cultural rejection
    of Western modernity. Second, is the idea that such rejection needs to be combated
    by a government-led 'battle of ideas'.   The
    government sees the emergence of an inter-linked global insurgency as the real
    threat represented by Al-Qaida: &ldquo;At various moments Al-Qaida
    and its associates have made the transition from terrorism to insurgency, notably
    in Iraq and Afghanistan. As insurgencies they have posed different and a wider
    threat to the uk and its interests than their forebears.&rdquo;   The
    terrain on which this 'battle of ideas'
    is to be fought is thus the attitudes and opinions of mainstream Muslims in Britain.
    The possibility of anti-Western extremists winning over mainstream Muslims to
    their cause comes to be seen as a strategic challenge to British national security.
    The danger here is that British Muslims become, in the imagination of the counter-terrorist
    system, no longer citizens to whom the state is accountable but potential recruits
    to a global counterinsurgency that is threatening the state's
    prospects of prevailing in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. This international
    dimension means that the attention focused on this extremism is of a completely
    different kind to that focused on, say, right wing extremism, which is taken to
    be no more than a public order threat. What emerges is a determination that the
    problem can only be fully addressed if Muslims take it upon themselves to do more,
    to actively mobilize against the extremists, and that therefore more pressure
    should be brought to bear upon Muslims in general and their community organisations.  *********************** A

    in Turkey an example of the West's 'cultural imperialism'?

     \"When we are speaking about Santa Claus, decorated pine trees, and nicely
    packed presents, we are referring to a certain type of Christian culture that
    arose in the West in modern times. Medieval Christianity, with its scary gothic
    cathedrals, inquisitions, witch hunts, and exaggerated fear of sin and demons,
    was certainly much less fun.  Even today there is a big difference between
    Eastern Christianity and its Western, especially American, counterpart. Go to
    a Protestant church in southern California, and then an Eastern Orthodox one in
    Russia, and you will see the difference.  Islam, too, is predominantly an
    Eastern religion. Its culture evolved mainly in the pre-modern Middle East, and
    within agricultural societies consisting mostly of peasants. (The merchant class,
    which was quite influential in the earliest centuries of Islam, declined gradually
    as the world trade routes shifted away from the Middle East.)  Agricultural
    societies are not dynamic. People don't travel and see new
    things. If the land is arid, like it is in the Middle East, sustenance becomes
    life's main challenge. You do not have many resources to feed
    your family, let alone buy gifts and organize parties. What you pray for most
    is not a good education, or a career. Rather you pray for more rainfall.\" ********** LMAO,
    soberly though."

<p>A chance conversation reminded me of something, which led to another trip down the 'stacks in Reg and Google Books and, lo and behold, I may have hit at the birthplace of TALIBOTHRA! Now, understand that this is an exercise in what professional historians call "speculative scholarship". As a professional historian, I believe it is my right to engage in such activities that are strictly off-limits to the lesser yous. </p>
<p>We all know that the word <i>Taliban</i> is plural of the Arabic <i>Talib</i> <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=en#ar|en|&Oslash;&middot;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Oslash;&uml;">meaning</a> "one who seeks". Most commonly it is a contraction of <i>Talib-i 'Ilm</i>, "one who seeks knowledge/learning" aka "student". Our current Taliban got the moniker because they belonged to a particular generation of seminary/madrasa students in Pakistan ('86-'90). So, Taliban = Talib-e ilm. All good? Now check it:</p>
<p><b>I.</b> "The Talib ilm or Student in Affghanistan is very different from the same species usually so called in India and Sindh. Like the members of our European Universities in the middle ages, the Affghan Student carries about his sword and dagger, and is fonder of broil than he is of his books. The duello of course is unknown, as the usual way to resent an insult is to draw a sword and cut the opponent down. As Mussulmans, they dare not openly indulge in the "wine and wassail" but the "emerald cup", in other words Cannabis sativa under the forms of bhang and charas, forms no contemptible succedaneum." (( Richard F. Burton, "Notes and Remarks on Dr. Dorn's Chrestomathy of the Pushtu or Affghan Language," <i>The Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, Jan 1849.)) </p>
<p><strong>II.</strong> "One evening in the month of September 1853 he had completed his day's work, and as he was seated outside his house receiving and hearing petitions, a man came up and handed to him what appeared to be a petition. As Mackeson was examining it, the miscreant drew a dagger, either from his sleeve or beneath his shirt, and stabbed him. He lingered some days, but the wound was fatal, and he died on September 14, 1853. The assassin was a Talib-ul-Ilm (a searcher after knowledge, i.e. a religious student), a resident of the Kuner Valley." (( Robert Warburton. <i>Eighteen Years in the Khyber, 1979-1898.</i> (London: John Murray, 1900) ))</p>
<p><strong>III.</strong> "Everywhere Mullahs, Shekhs and Sayads are objects of reverence, whose temporal wants are freely attended to. Mullahs of note attract to their mosques a number of wandering adventurers from other countries known as <i>talib-ilm</i> or seekers after learning; but who are most frequently idle vagabonds, ready to join in any piece of mischief which comes in their way: and sometimes the regularly employed spies of robbers and dacoits.<br />
...<br />
The <i>Talib-ul-ilm</i>, or 'seeker of wisdom' is the name applied to a mixed class of vagrants and idlers who, under the pretense of devoting themselves to religion, wander from country to country, and on the whole lead an agrreable and easy life." ((<i>Gazetteer of the Peshawar. 1897-98</i> (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1989): 102-12))</p>
<p>Say what you will, those British were preceptive people. ((I can't help but share some other gems from the <i>Gazetteer</i> about the Pathans: "Their superstition is incredible and knows no bounds". "The Pathans are a lively people, superstitious beyond belief and proud to a degree but brave and hospitable, two virtues compensating for many vices, among which may be mentioned distrustfulness, envy, resentment and vindictiveness." "The Pathans are said to be naturally very avaricious and grasping, selfish, merciless, strangers to affection and without gratitude." And perhaps my favorite colonial recommendation ever: "The poetry (of the Pathans) possesses some merit, and is worthy of attention from us by way of encouragement. Their music, too, though noisy, and the result of vigorous performance, is not without its peculiar merits, to judge from its exciting effects on a Pathan audience." Good Times, yeah?))</p>
