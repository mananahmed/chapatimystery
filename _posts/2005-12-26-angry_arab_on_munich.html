    Dear Readers,



    Do you want that Palestine will be free?

    If your answer is yes, I recommend you the following home page:

    http://www.alah.hu





    "This image shows the future. A minaret-form skyscraper rises from the mass of the buildings in New York, the most densely populated city of the United States. The building is the &Acirc;&not;&Atilde;&not;Tower of American-Islamic Friendship&Acirc;&not;&Atilde;&reg;. It symbolizes two things: on one hand there are a growing number of Moslem people in the U.S.; and on the other hand it shows that the U.S. is in alliance with the Islamic countries. Due to the new friendship America does not provide any more financial or military aid to Israel, which leads to the weakening of Israel and consequently, the freedom of Palestine."



    Sincerely,

    Zoltan Biro

  content: "How Convenient \n\nSo far this year we&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;ve
    had an overgrown gorilla ignite the innate human fear of things misunderstood,
    a lion battle a witch, and Harry Potter take down the forces of the dark side.
    How convenient, that on the eve of the third year of the war on terror that Spielberg
    releases a little reminder that all things Arabic are basically evil. How convenient,
    that in less than two weeks Georgie W Peorgie will reassure the American people
    of the same concept. How convenient, that in the final scene of Munich there the
    Twin Towers proudly stand in a warm panoramic shot 3 decades before 9-11 reminding
    us all, what was, and what is now gone.\n\nThe movie begins with a provocative
    and captivating account of the kidnapping and executions of Israeli athletes at
    the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Deutschland. It follows with an interesting
    window into the varied perspectives of common peoples&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;
    reactions in the Mid-East as they watch these events unfold on their televisions.
    The good story telling quickly dies thereafter as soon as Eric Bana&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    character, Avner, is recruited to lead a team of professionals to hunt down and
    execute the Palestinians responsible. And for the next two hours I was bored to
    tears with this hero&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s quest
    to fulfill his obligations a Zionist. The performances in this movie were lifeless
    and impassionate. The dialogue: shallow and predictable. The cinematography: an
    insult to the beauty of the cities it depicted. The mood: dull. The direction:
    non-existent. The point of the whole freaking movie: weaker than my ability to
    resist DJs with brown eyes and dreadlocks. \n\nHowever there were a few highpoints
    in the flick. \n1-\tThe happy trail on Eric Baan&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    beautiful torso. \n2-\tThe John Woo-esque face to face, gun to gun stand off between
    the Israeli and Palestinian assassins. \n3-\tThe unfortunately brief and underdeveloped
    scene where Avner stands in a stair well with a Palestinian and discusses the
    meaning of &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;home&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;.
    It&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s also the only scene in
    the movie that remotely attempts to disclose the reasoning behind the attack in
    Munich and basically all the violence that has occurred since 1947.\n\nThis movie
    is worth the $9.50 if you suffer from insomnia and the melatonin you bought hasn&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t
    kicked in yet. It&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s also worth
    seeing if you get some nationalistic enjoyment from seeing Arabic people demonized
    and depicted as animals who kill indiscriminately and for no logical reason whatsoever.\n\nFor
    everyone else, don&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t waste your
    time or money. This kind of propaganda is beneath your intelligence. \n\nMunich\nReviewed
    by Your American Julie"
