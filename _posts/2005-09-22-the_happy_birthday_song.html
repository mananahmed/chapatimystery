    Sepoy, love the blog.  Keep up the good work.  I noticed your piece on 'Kingfisher Beer'.  Do you drink alcohol?  Or in the spirit of great creative thinkers, blaze charas???

    Happy Birthday!

  content: Rob, Sin! Welcome back, mates. And thanks, Rezwan and Har. For the first
    time in at least 11 years, I had to listen to the BD song - Twice. That alone
    makes this one memorable.

    Belated birthday greetings!

    Enjoy the era in which one can still proudly declare one's age ;)

<p>Here, to hoping that this one is less exciting than the one last year [hung  our with The Decembrists, got my first speeding ticket in 10 years, someone broke into my car and stole my iPod and digicam and I grew one year older]. Ok, that last bit cannot be avoided this year, either.</p>
