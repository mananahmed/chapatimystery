<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/sunday.jpg">It sure is hot up in here. How are all of you doing? Today seems like the perfect summer afternoon to hide in an air-conditioned movie theater with Charlie. That is so the plan. The reading list for today is a tad haphazard - as they always are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <i>LRB</i>, Maya Jasanoff <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n14/jasa01_.html">reviews</a> Gautam Chakravarty's <i>The Indian Mutiny and the British Imagination</i>. A subject dear to my heart - though far from my area of research. The book has mysteries, chapatis and homi bhabha. Trifecta! The monograph is a study of novels about the mutiny up to the 1916 or so. Sounds promising, no?
<li>Not to be outdone, Aamir Khan has rushed a movie into theaters to provide the view of the Indian Mutiny in the Indian Imagination. I kid. <a href="http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2005/jul/15rising.htm">Mangal Pandey: The Rising</a> has been 4 years in the making. Aamir Khan thinks that it has lessons for the young generation and others about freedom fighters because, <i>"whether it be Afganistan or Iraq, we see foreign powers trying to impose their administration on local people"</i>. Indian Express runs a selection about the sepoy, <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=72790">Mangal Pandey</a>.
<li>Empires, resistances and imaginations being what they are, I liked Jim Hoagland's piece in <i>WaPo</i>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/15/AR2005071501616_pf.html">Lessons of Mideast Empire</a>.
<li>Afghanistan is seeing the return of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/17/top5.htm">Taliban</a>. I am sure <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/lash1202.html">this guy</a> will find a job now in <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_16-7-2005_pg7_9">Peshawer</a>.
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4690853.stm">This</a> piece by Aamer Ahmed Khan made me laugh. Tea and cakes, indeed.
</ul>
