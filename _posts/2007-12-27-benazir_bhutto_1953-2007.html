I wonder if they'll get it together to write something with new content and a more appropriate tone.

  content: Maybe this is the natural fate of political dynasties in South Asia. Whether
    suicide bombers or one's own guards (as with Indira Gandhi) the blowback from
    internal warfare hits back hard on the highest in the land. Many people have compared
    Benazir to Rajeev Gandhi, but to me she embodied all the scheming megalomania
    and charming corruption of Mrs Gandhi.

    accept that.  What good would it do?  When someone's a public figure whose
    decisions affect the lives of millions of people, then they should always face
    scrutiny and criticism, even in death.  IMO, an assassination doesn't mean we
    self-censor ourselves, even for a moment.  When Cheney dies, most people all over
    the world aren't going to take a respectful moment to put aside the atrocities
    he's committed.  I'm sure a \"non-judgemental moment of resepect\" would
    mean nothing to her dead brother (whom Bhutto may have had a hand in assassinating),
    or the people suffering in Pakistan thanks to her contempt for the working class
    and her plundering the treasure, or the people suffering in Afghanistan thanks
    to her well-documented support of the Taliban.  What happened is a horrible
    and inexcusible.  But that doesn't mean we have to be silent and fake about who
    she was."

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/world/asia/28pakistan.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">Benazir Bhutto was killed at a PPP rally</a> in Rawalpindi. At least 15 other are being reported dead in the attack. The election rally, with <a href="http://www.brecorder.com/latestindex.php?latest_id=6858&cindex=21&current_page=1">"foolproof security"</a>, was held at Liaqut Bagh -  a site which had already seen the assassination of another Prime Minister of Pakistan, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaqat_Ali_Khan">Liaqut Ali Khan</a>.</p>
<p>There were earlier reports of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/text/nat1.htm">security threats</a> on her rally - similar reports were issued before the suicide attack on her in October. </p>
<p>In the nation whose history is dotted by military coups, assassinations and hangings of public figures, this is surely the bloodiest stain. She titled her autobiography, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Destiny-Autobiography-Benazir-Bhutto/dp/0671696033">Daughter of Destiny</a> - but surely she deserved a fate other than the destiny of her father and Liaqut Ali Khan. It is truly a tragedy and a revelation of the chaos gripping the nation.</p>
<p><b>aftermath:</b> Riots are being reported in various cities. Rawalpindi is in chaos. Cable and cell phone services has been suspended in most of the country. Rumors are flying of curfews. No word from Musharraf, yet.

<p> - A rather <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/world/asia/28bhuttocnd.html?ex=1356498000&amp;en=513d9ea47a48e784&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">disturbingly condescending</a> obituary from the NYT. She had "grand ambition", "considerable charm", and engaged in a "dance of veils". How Salom&Atilde;&copy; of her. I also like how she is humanized for the American readers by a scant connection to an American diplomat. </p>
<p>Update from lapata:  A really excellent photo album of Benazir <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sanjai007/SPRSocial">here</a>. </p>
<p><b>Strange</b>: NYT has changed their Obit - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/world/asia/28bhutto.html?ex=1356498000&amp;en=432ed68041b50675&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">Benazir Bhutto, 54, Weathered Political Storm</a>, by John Burns. But get this, the earlier obit that I linked to above, has been amended to remove references to "veils" and "world's first prime leader" to "first female leader". How odd. You can still read the older, reflexively paternalistic and orientalist reading, written by Jane Perlez and Victoria Burnett, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/27/asia/bhutto.php">here</a>.</p>
