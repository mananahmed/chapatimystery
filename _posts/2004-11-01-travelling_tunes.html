  content: You kids and your old people music! :-) Really, another cool list that
    is completely different than mine, in a good way. I need to start putting some
    older music on my lists.

<p><img src="/img/list.gif" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6> I have driven across continental US twice - once without any sound system and once with only a working radio in the car. No one, perhaps, can understand the horror that is radio broadcasts in Kansas.<br />
Here are some songs that I wish I was listening to...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Magnetic Fields</b>: <i>Long Vermont Roads</i>. Actually, one can pick any song of this brilliant album, <i>The Charm of the Highway Strip</i>, which is all about road songs, but I am partial to this one.
<li><b>Grant Lee-Phillips</b>: <i>See America</i>. The guy is hit and miss but I like the idea of hopping into a cab and telling the driver to drive across America.
<li><b>Robert Johnson</b>: <i>Roadside Travellin' Blues</i>. The legend of meeting the Devil on the Crossroads begins.
<li><b>Holly Golightly</b>: <i>Walk a Mile</i>. I love her unlovable voice. And she wants you to walk a mile in her platform, polka-dotted shoes. How can you not like that!?
<li><b>David Byrne</b>: <i>Don't Fence Me In</i>. Old Cole Porter that David Byrne turns into some rollickin' country anthem. Great car singalong (with a chorus for the back-seat wallas).
<li><b>Talking Heads</b>: <i>Road to Nowhere</i>. <i>I&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;m feelin&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp; okay this mornin&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp; / And you know / We&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;re on the road to paradise / Here we go, here we go</i>. Road to the White House!
<li><b>Lucinda Williams</b>: <i>Jackson</i>. I like frequent stops.
<li><b>Proclaimers</b>: <i>I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)</i>. A song that actually played a role in the courtship of Mrs. Sepoy. She made me walk 500 miles. Heartless wench.
<li><b>Air</b>: <i>Universal Traveler</i>. Universal or Universoul? What the hell are these trip-hopping frenchmen saying? Nice blips nonetheless.
<li><b>Roger Miller</b>: <i>King of the Road</i>. Will it surprise anyone if I say this song captures, absolutely brilliantly, how I wanted to live my life at the age of 16? <i>Third boxcar, midnight train / Destination...Bangor, Maine / Old worn out clothes and shoes / I don't pay no union dues / I smoke old stogies I have found / Short, but not too big around / I'm a man of means by no means King of the road </i>. I had never heard this song, nor read Kerouac, but I used to sneak out of the house and board empty train compartments at night.
</ul>
