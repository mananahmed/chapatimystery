    along with a bunch of 'essential' Hindi/Urdu works discovered after reading your
    post on Amitava Kumar's novel. Your articles on CM and Bookslut are gold. Such
    great pleasure and experience they give and lead to. May your tribe increase."

  content: 'Thanks, Sundeep! Your comments warm my heart. I am happy to reveal that
    Proustian work: it is the Girti Divaren (''falling walls'') series of novels by
    Upendranath Ashk. The novels haven''t been translated, but I am now starting to
    work on that project. I did write my dissertation on Ashk''s novels though, and
    it was published by Katha in India under the title Upendranath Ashk: A Critical
    Biography.'

    the English title. That's going to be the subject of a more, later post. Stay
    tuned!

  content: "Slightly off-topic but....\r\n\r\nChapati Mystery might actually have
    been Poori Mystery.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?269638\r\n\r\n\"....It
    seems that the 'Chapati Conspiracy' of 1857
    was in fact a 'Poori Plot'. Pooris do make
    better strategic sense. Fried in oil, they may become rancid but would survive
    longer than any chapati, which would turn dry and crumble to bits in a few days....\"\r\n\r\nPS:
    I am not a regular reader here. But this article reminded me of your blog."

  content: "[...] This 6th year of CM will go down in the annals of Chapatism, first
    and foremost, as a year of the renaissance sprung by Lapata's
    posts — for which readers have the bureaucratic morass of academy,
    &ldquo;the insane rants of an inflamed tea-partier&rdquo;,
    and Sepoy's badgering to thank — illuminating
    the particularities of partition or the reluctant feudalism of mango farmers,
    introducing CM readers to Naiyer Masud and Amitava Kumar, or providing a peep
    into Memon Sahib's literary striptease, and culminating in
    The War and Peace of Hindi Literature! [...]"

<p>My new December column is up on Bookslut. There's so much more to say about this book, and I will have write more in the coming days, but for now, here is an excerpt:</p>
<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/12/yashpal.jpg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/12/yashpal-215x300.jpg" alt="" title="Yashpal" width="215" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5912" /></a><br />
<blockquote>I read <em>War and Peace</em> a number of years ago in Allahabad, India, in March or April, when the temperatures begin to soar. Our roof-top apartment, so delightfully airy during other months, slowly transformed into an oven. This was how we learned why no landlord in India lives in the top floor of their house if they can avoid it. Frequent power outages exacerbate the situation, and by mid-day each day, the best course of action was to lie in the dark as immobile as possible and read. Napoleon's ill-advised campaign into Russia, the arrival of winter and the freeze-out of the French army provided a cooling balm to my imagination, if not my body.</p>
<p>I was reading War and Peace so that I might be able to continue to say, with confidence, that the Hindi novel <em>Jhootha Sach</em>, which means "False truth," was "the War and Peace of Hindi literature." It was a claim that was often thrown around, and one that I had carelessly made myself. Reading one book to find out if it can be used as an exemplar of another one has already read is ostensibly going about things backwards. But I had a particular motivation: <em>Jhootha Sach</em> was untranslated and I wanted to make the case that this fact was a tragedy for literature lovers around the world. Just imagine if <em>War and Peace</em> was sitting around in Russia, untranslated, and no non-Russian readers were able to access it? How culturally impoverished we would be if that were the case, even those of us who had never bothered to read it because of its notorious heft?</p></blockquote>
