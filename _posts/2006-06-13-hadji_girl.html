  content: "A while ago you asked me about the term \"haji,\" and if I'd heard it
    used in a possibly derogatory sense. I said yes, but couldn't remember where or
    when--just that it was long, long ago. \n\n\n\nGoing through my CDs from high
    school recently, I came across the Mighty Mighty Bosstones' debut \"Devil's Night
    Out.\" It features a song called \"Haji.\" The lyrics (available here: http://www.mp3lyrics.org/m/mighty-mighty-bosstones/haji/
    ) seem to be little more than orientalist fantasies--the Bosstones were never
    noted for lyrical complexity.\n\n\n\nAnyway, what's interesting to me is that
    \"DNO\" came out in 1989--in other words before Iraq even marched into Kuwait.
    So the origins of the term fade deeper into the mists. It's also unclear precisely
    what would have been going on socially for Dicky Barrett to have heard the term
    himself."

  content: "Excellent catch, yo! In a related thread over at Cliopatria last year,
    Jonathan Dresner noted that <a href=\"http://hnn.us/comments/63937.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">It's
    probably from Johnny Quest: his sidekick (Sikh origin, would be my current guess
    based on my fuzzy memories and current knowledge) was named \"Hadji\" </a>. Sounds
    plausible. \n\n\n\nAs for Dicky Barrett, it should be noted that Jonny Quest entered
    syndication in 1986."

  content: 'Hmmm...I also wouldn''t be too surprised if the term has been around in
    immigrant communities in the east coast. I know in baltimore and DC, the term
    for fruit stand/roving fruit merchant is "araber", they actually make it into
    a plot element in "Homicide: Life on the Streets". I don''t know what part of
    boston the mighty bosstones are from, but lebanese immigration to beantown has
    been going on at least since gibran khalil gibran''s time. Just sayin, it just
    could be a local thing.'
