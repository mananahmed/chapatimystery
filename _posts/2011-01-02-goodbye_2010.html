<p>This <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/holydays/6.html">6th</a> year of CM will go down in the annals of Chapatism, first and foremost, as a year of the renaissance sprung by Lapata's posts — for which readers have the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/academic_publishing-2.html">bureaucratic morass</a> of academy, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/stardust/from_the_department_of_unfinished_business.html">&ldquo;the insane rants of an inflamed tea-partier&rdquo;</a>, and Sepoy's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/particularities_of_partition_literature_i.html">badgering</a> to thank — illuminating the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/particularities_of_partition_ii.html">particularities of partition</a> or the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/the_reluctant_feudalist.html">reluctant feudalism</a> of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/i_am_a_bhains.html">mango farmers</a>, introducing CM readers to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/the_stay-at-home_man.html">Naiyer Masud</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/flyover_country.html">Amitava Kumar</a>, or providing a peep into Memon Sahib's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/literary_striptease.html">literary striptease</a>, and culminating in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/the_war_and_peace_of_hindi_literature.html">The War and Peace of Hindi Literature!</a></p>
<p>Sepoy moved to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/noted/letter_from_berlin.html">Berlin</a> but continued to bring readers reviews of the quality that they have come to expect from him; reviews such as that of William Dalrymple's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/nine_lives.html">Nine Lives</a>, Amitava Kumar's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/imagined_terrorists.html">A Foreigner</a>, Fatima Bhutto's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/songs_of_blood_and_sword.html">Songs of Blood and Sword</a>, and last but not the least, a takedown of a globe-trotter's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/noted/shiny_domes.html">cartographic musings</a>.</p>
<p>Some conversations that started in 2009 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/strict_interpretations.html">continued</a> in 2010: amidst growing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/little_green_men.html">alienation</a>, Faisal Shehzad became the face of a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/a_pakistan_native.html">&ldquo;Pakistan native;&rdquo;</a> Pakistan's originary myth remained <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/the_daughter_of_islam.html">tied to spectacular events</a>; Zaid Hamid was given thorough <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/the_apocalypses_of_zaid_hamid.html">examination</a> by a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/noted/this_history_is_hindoo.html">&ldquo;so called Pakistani historian,&rdquo;</a> who also reflected upon the history of erasures and repressions that culminated in the horrific attack on an Ahmadi mosque in Lahore in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}?s=We+Are+All+Ahmadi">&ldquo;We Are All Ahmadi&rdquo;</a> series. In the year of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/donate_for_pakistan_flood_2010.html">catastrophic</a> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/pakistan_flood_2010_continues.html">floods</a>, the fires of hatred <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/dominance_without_toleration.html">continued</a> to burn (in) homistan, while the discussion amongst politicians remained focused on how to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/save_the_children.html">save the children</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the major event at CM was <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/peccavistan.html">Granta: Peccavistan</a> (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/getting_to_know_you.html">also reviewed by Lapata</a>) and an exploration of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/cocoonistan.html">Cocoonistan</a> from whence <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/more_on_granta_pakistan.html">developmentalist discourse</a> springs.</p>
<p>PS. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/simon_digby_historian.html">Simon Digby</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/tony_judt_rip.html">Tony Judt</a> will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>PPS. Also see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/syed_ahmed_khan_and_urdu.html">Syed Ahmed Khan and Urdu</a>, and Basanti's stellar review of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/talkies/ishqiya.html">Ishqiya</a>.</p>
