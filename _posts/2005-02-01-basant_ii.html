    If Basant isnt a hindu festival ... where it originates from ?

    ... and a very strong viewpoint of the clergy to denounce basant is ... waste of time & money !

    each year millions of money wasted on paper kites ... (other then the lavish arrangements all over Lahore)

    ... many people ... specially small boys from poor neighbourhood lost their lives ... in number of accidents ... but no one pay attention as it wasnt any of their own relative.

    ... it is just like ... forgeting Gujrat Earthquake ... but an event like Tsunami teh whole world knows !

  content: "sorry for these absurdly long 'comments', but all this discussion about
    kites reminded me of something i wrote a long time ago... which sort of fits!
     \nIt was a warm September afternoon with the humidity of a monsoon that&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    over but doesn&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;t know that yet. Classes
    had ended for the day and Angel and Sky walked hand in hand out across the shaggy
    green lawns, and through the gate, waving at me as they went. I looked down at
    the large wooden spindle in my hand, its edges rough and chipped where it had
    rolled over stones and grit.  Its handles worn polished dark grimy smooth by spinning
    with wind-tugs while held snug in the webbings between the thumbs and forefingers
    of many an enthusiastic apprentice. Its bobbin wrapped around with the finest
    dirty white dora, a kilometre of it, no ground glass coating. The kite itself
    was the largest I had found in all the alleys of MalkaGanj, its span almost as
    wide as the street in which the shop was, and its pink, which had caught a stray
    ray of the setting sun when I got there, as loud as a neon wedding. There were
    gold birds, which, impossibly, seemed embossed on the thin, taut paper. The man
    who made it had the cloudy beginnings of a cataract in one eye, and the shop wasn&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;t
    high enough for him to stand upright in.  It was the most beautiful kite I
    ever flew. Out on the beaten yellow grass of the playing field, a half dozen
    sluggish cricket matches slowly dwindled away as the kite rose. The air was still
    at ground-level, but as always when flying a kite, the wind seemed to be in my
    hair. The pull and pull and tug, weaving an invisible tapestry across the sky,
    and when it got high enough, the constant fight to break free. Then distance became
    academic, as all that held us together was a parabolic curve of string, taut as
    a tuned guitar&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s. I squinted up into
    the sun, and half a mile above a small dark diamond whirled, a dervish in a tight
    thermal. Much later when she told me about that day, it was the kite that she
    started with. When Sky and her, after drinking soda from marble stoppered banta
    bottles, and sharing a nervous cigarette outside the college gates, had finally
    got onto a rickshaw and started towards VijayNagar, the kite had just, in a flapping,
    morose manner, risen above the college buildings. And when they kissed by the
    window of the second storey flat, generously donated by a friend, she could see
    the kite, a hundred feet in the air, the only one visible for miles. -\tIt
    was our first time with each other, she said, as she sat hugging her knees on
    the rug on the far side of the room, on the day after Sky&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    funeral. As my orgasm came closer it was no longer Sky&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    face with its peculiar concentration hanging over mine that I saw, but two kites.
    Two kites, violently twisting and jerking across the sky, their glass-edged strings
    snaking around each other, bound together and pulling apart, each trying to cut
    the other loose. And when it flowed, one kite was cut adrift, and floated, and
    pirouetted and tumbled and careened, blown by the wind, constantly seeming larger,
    but never losing altitude.  Towards sunset I slowly, reluctantly brought the
    kite down from a sky that had turned its exact shades of pink and gold. On the
    way to my room, I stopped for a habitual peek at the TV in the common room. And
    for the next half-hour, kept standing there. The crowd around the TV kept growing.
    One of my friends came in, sweaty from an evening run, and started yelling &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&acute;Long
    live the Revolution&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp; and pumping his
    arms in the air. All heads turned to look at him. Then there was no thought
    in my head except that I had to tell Angel. I ran all the way to VijayNagar, the
    streets a swift grey blur of unremembered familiarity, people and cows just obstacles
    to be narrowly brushed past. Angel opened the door, wearing Sky&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    favourite faded T-shirt; through the door I could see him lying on the crumpled
    sheets on the camp bed, smoking a cigarette, angry.   - Two airliners have
    flown into the World Trade Centre buildings in New York. Thought you&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;d
    like to know.   Angel hugged me. Sky got up from bed and took a step towards
    us and stopped. There were tears flowing from my eyes and down onto his T-shirt.
     At the moment when she had been closest to him, I had barged in. And he had
    to stop and look, from a distance. For it wasn&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;t
    me barging in, come to think of it, it was the story. A story that ran through
    our lives and bound Angel and me together, a story to which he had been spectator
    before, and would be again. A story that had just outgrown the insignificant traumas
    of our unknown lives to become the mythology of the media. That was why my
    tears flowed. Not for America, not for the Middle East, not for human life, not
    for New York. But for that now there would be no escape from the images of death
    falling from the sky on the unsuspecting. For the secret language of my nightmares
    had become the lingua franca of the world."

<p><img src="/img/basant2.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>One confession. All I know about Basant and kites and strings, I learned from Aamir on the back of his ancient <a href="http://www.vf750fd.com/blurbs/brochures/ss50/ss50e.jpg">honda</a>. We would be trolling the byways of Lahore, ditching classes and committments, and Aamir would grind the bike to a halt, point to some mid-distance in the sky and explain to me the <i>paitch</i> in progress. As far as I could, and can, tell there would be two barely visible pieces of paper in the sky but he would know the backstory, strategy and result of the competition in progress. I usually nodded and acted bored. But he wrote stuff down for me so that I can give it to you, my gentle readers.</p>
<p><b>Type of Kites</b>: The internets are not that helpful when it comes to images of the various types of kites. Help readers.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Guda / Gudi</i>:They are squares with tails or without. <a href="http://francois.gonnet.free.fr/picture%20patang.htm">Like this</a>. Or <a href="http://www.syedaounraza.8m.net/img/ali_faisalkite.jpg">that</a>. Stable but not as fast and not much control.
<li><i>Patang / Kunkwa</i>:  This is the pro version. Looks like <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~ghsiung/tukal.jpg">this</a>. Stable, strong and fast but lacks good control.
<li><i>Coop</i>: Looks like the patang but with a bigger bottom giving it more control.
<li><i>Cheel Kaat</i>: LIke a elongated guda but bigger. Fast and strong.
<li><i>Jahaaz</i>: Looks weird (distance between the top and bottom half of the patang)
<li><i>Sharla</i>: For the kids.
<li><i>Kabuli Guda</i>: Afghani variety
</ul>
<p><b>Strings</b>: The kite string is where it at though. All of the kites have a weight and wind resistance. The string needs to be strong enough to carry the kite. </p>
<p>There are two ways to categorize the <i>Dore</i> -strings: By the thickness of the string and the grade/amount of glass in the <i>Manjha</i> (coated mixture). Any string can be used to fly any kite but one has to make sure that the string can bear the weight of the kite. So, people get 6 or 7 different types of strings prepared - of varying thickness - and use them with different types of kites.<br />
Below the fold are some pictures of a string making session that I took at last year's basant. Enjoy.<br />
