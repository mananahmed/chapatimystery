  content: "On the MQM, I think one has to recognize the party's strong role against
    Islamic extremism.  Hardly a model party by any means, but Karachi is today the
    safest large city in Pakistan (ironic, as it used to be the one \"unmanageable\"
    city when I was growing up).  And its good work in delivering improved social
    services and infrastructure under the current city nazim Mustafa Kamal is undoubtedly
    winning it greater legitimacy.  On the EU-style union: not sure I follow:
    is your point that the likelihood of this has decreased following the \"war on
    terror\", or that your desire to see this sort of thing come to fruition has decreased
    following the \"war on terror\"?  If the former, I agree with you, but I don't
    see why the latter should happen..."

  content: "Re-imagining Pakistan is certainly no easy task -- unlike Turkey, Malaysia,
    etc., the historical fact that Pakistan must always contend with is the two nation
    theory and Partition.  The reason this matters, even 60 years later, is that the
    basis for Pakistan being Pakistan (I mean the basis for Balochis, Pashtuns, Punjabis,
    Kashmiris, Sindhis, and -- this is crucial -- Urdu-speakers who are descended
    from immigrants from post-1947 India) is that it is the un-India.  The problem
    this poses is an obvious one, and undercuts Jinnah's (often-expressed post-Aug.
    1947) desire for a Pakistan and \"Hindustan\" living in peace, side-by-side.  That
    is to say, while a cold peace (akin to Israel and Egypt) would not raise an ideological
    issue, a \"warm\" peace (as would be a pre-condition to any EU-style grouping,
    or even to any \"soft border\" arrangement as Nehru increasingly favored by the
    1960s as a solution to both Kashmir and East Pakistan) raises difficult questions
    for the founding basis of Pakistan.  Note the problem: I say \"raises difficult
    questions\", but perversely, these questions are raised for the LIBERAL or the
    secular Pakistani; these questions would not be raised for those who wish to imagine
    Pakistan as sharia state (i.e. the latter could have a warm peace with India,
    because their Pakistan ideology would not simply be \"Jinnah's two nation theory\"
    but would be \"two nation theory as defined in terms of religiosity and religious
    observance\" (i.e. not simply communal identity)).  I don't pretend to have the
    answers here, but it seems to me that the sub-continental progressives I have
    encountered don't seem to even recognize the issue for the most part: in India,
    liberals often tend to equate Muslim religiosity with the two nation theory, which
    I feel is a misreading of the historical record; in Pakistan, even the liberals
    are \"post-two nation theory\" and accept it as a given, not recognizing that
    those inclined to recast the polity in religious terms have a powerful ideological
    weapon (i.e. the latter are analyzed only in terms of \"backwardness\", savagery,
    etc.)."

  content: "Oops, meant to write above:  \"I mean the basis for Balochis, Pashtuns,
    Punjabis, Kashmiris, Sindhis, and &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; this is crucial &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    Urdu-speakers who are descended from immigrants from post-1947 India, BEING ONE
    NATION...\"  PS-- the ideological issue for Pakistani liberals would also
    be an easier one if India formally became a Hindu state, as Nepal historically
    has been.  If that happened, one would not feel the need to go \"Islamic\" to
    \"salvage\" the two-nation theory, as the mere fact of being Muslim-majority might
    be enough.  [Perhaps this explains why my Pakistani friends and acquaintances
    tend to express greater discomfort with the Nehruvian mindset than with the likes
    of Vajpayee or Advani: the latter folks promise an ideologically stable Indo-Pak
    axis (albeit a nightmarish one for those who wish to secure/maintain the Indian
    polity on a non-sectarian basis), whereas the Nehrus of the world immediately
    raise the specter of \"they want to swallow us up\" among many Pakistanis.]  The
    reason this matters, and is not just abstract theorizing, is that if my analysis
    has any merit, then we need to question the assumptions that the Indian and Pakistani
    intelligentsia seems to share, most recently during the 4-5 year peace process:
    namely, that all will be well if the ideological issues are jettisoned, people-to-people
    contacts are fostered, etc.  These \"contacts\", while I welcome them (at a personal
    level, anyone with family on both sides, as I have, will be gratified; more importantly,
    the cricket fan in me was gratified), might actually mean GREATER political anxiety
    if the ideological elephant in the room is not addressed..."

  content: 'On the New York Times piece yesterday, it was pretty laughable: the notion
    that Punjab is crumbling under a Taliban advance is pretty ludicrous to me, and
    to anyone who has any familiarity with how Pakistan is set up.  It was also notable
    that the journalists did not stop to consider that the anonymous Pakistani sources
    being quoted might have their own political agendas: for instance, is it so hard
    to believe that PML(N) supporters would have a vested interest in playing up the
    situation in order to discredit the PPP government in the Western media?  [I have
    no reason to believe that the sources were supporters of this or that party, but
    wonder if the writers even bothered to ask the question.]  This ties into the
    wider point that is often lost in critiques of Edward Said etc. (seeing as this
    is the season for that sorta thing), namely that "orientalism" is not so much
    about the good or bad faith of the "occidental gaze", but about the fact that
    "oriental" is denied full personhood in one''s merely ANTHROPOLOGICAL engagement
    with him/her.  Thus, people quoted in such pieces are "a landlord", "a peasant",
    "a Shiite", etc. (not the sorts of categories used in, e.g., a story set in France:
    there we would speak of "left" and "right"-wingers, not simply of Catholics, Bretons,
    or people from rich families)...'

  content: "My only comment to the writer is before you write something, please check
    the facts. For example you write Baluchistan, another princely state which
    was militarily merged with Pakistan after Partition, had no role in the federal
    state. After the 1955 One Unit Proclamation, the Khan of Kalat tried again to
    declare sovereignty. General Tikka Khan (&rdquo;the butcher of Bengal&rdquo;)
    was sent to Baluchistan in 1958 under Yahya's military rule
    to enforce federal writ. Things simmered until Bhutto has to send more army troops
    against another militant uprising in the region from '72-'74.
    So, there is no love lost between the center and Baluchistan.  For your
    reference Mr Yahya Khan was not the military ruler in 1958. And Gen Tikka Khan
    was in Baluchistan during the Bhutto government n.  Please check the facts, which
    is easy to do now a days due to google search."

  content: "Re: \"It would be really useful to have an answer to the question 'What
    is Pakistan for?'\"  Saif: This might suggest another
    question, namely as to why or whether Pakistan is the only country for which one
    should be posing this question.  I think we should be careful lest we inadvertently
    leave an impression that other nation-states are somehow \"natural\" or to be
    accepted as \"given\", whereas Pakistan must always justify its existence.  Certainly
    I do not believe any such thing: inasmuch as nation-states are ideological constructs,
    they are not natural and cannot simply be treated as \"givens\" (of course, some
    nations are constructed on other than an ideological basis -- Jordan comes to
    mind, created to accomodate a ruling family for its loyalty to the British, and
    to compensate it for the loss of the family seat in Mecca; but these nation-states
    are certainly not any more natural).    A difference, however, arises because
    the ideology of certain nation-states is one of \"naturalness.\"  Germany is a
    good example: no-one ever asks what the purpose of Germany is, or what Germany
    is \"for\", because it seems self-evident to everybody that Germany is simply
    the homeland of all the Germans.  This is the sort of nation-state that people
    often think of as simply a \"natural\" or \"given\" nation-state.  It is anything
    but, as a glance at the historical record will show -- I am referring here not
    simply to the creation of Germany over the course of the 19th century, but about
    the 1945 (and post-1945) mass expulsions, population transfers, etc. that brought
    about a state of affairs such that ethnic Germans were removed from other countries,
    and moved to Germany.  By contrast, while at one level France might be thought
    of as the homeland of the French, the state's self-image is very much tied up
    with the notion that it is an inheritor to the French Revolution, etc.  There
    is thus an explicitly \"performative\" aspect to the idea of France: in order
    for France to BE France, it must stand for something other than merely the place
    where the French live.  Stated differently, in normal times, and although both
    nation-states are clearly ideological constructs, only one (Germany) can plausibly
    pass itself off as \"natural\"; the other (France) seems a bit more ideological
    (aside: in ABnormal times, of course, the performative aspect of even Germany's
    ideological foundations would be revealed -- for instance, if the question were
    raised as to what constituted German-ness, or if group x or y was German to begin
    with).  It seems to me that Israel, the USA, Pakistan, are more like France, and
    the United Kingdom, Poland, Egypt, or Iran, are more like Germany*.  If so, then
    only the former group of nation-states feel compelled to \"enact\" their founding
    ideologies even in the course of normal functioning, and thus this question of
    what Pakistan is \"for\" can arise; but if we remember that the self-image of
    nation-states notwithstanding, all have \"justification\" issues, then Pakistan
    seems like less of an exceptional case.  [I mentioned above that a \"difference\"
    remains: but that difference is a practical one, arising from the fact that Pakistanis,
    Israelis, and Americans THEMSELVES do not really see their nation-state as natural,
    the way Germans do; and is not a philosophical difference.  The two-nation theory
    was an attempt to \"naturalize\" the discourse, but, although it tapped into the
    easily comprehensible notion that Hindus and Muslims are \"very different\", that
    difference couldn't easily be shoehorned into the rhetoric of modern nationalism,
    and an anxiety remains: the two-nation theory (and being other-than-Indian) has
    never come to seem as \"natural\" as \"being German\" has, and Pakistan has felt
    compelled to enact the two-nation theory in a kind of perpetual justification
    -- like the USA, Israel, and France.]  *[My examples are not to be taken
    too literally; in a sense \"France\" and \"Germany\" are labels that I use for
    ease of argument, and quite possibly no nation-state is fully one \"type\" as
    opposed to another.  India and Bangladesh are good examples, they can quite easily
    be classified in either group.]"

  content: "Perhaps, then, the first step toward answering the sorts of questions
    that sepoy, Saif, and I have raised, may be taken by advancing a kind of modesty
    of national purpose.  That is, should we explicitly recognize the contingent nature
    of all nation-states, and thereafter try and build on a national ideology based
    purely on the fact that history is irredeemable?  We got here however we got here,*
    and the question is how are we to proceed from here-- perhaps that is what sepoy's
    idea of \"justice\" points to: one might never be able to get rid of all the ideological
    baggage, or even to sweep it under the rug, but the national energies should be
    harnessed in the service of something different -- not an idea (such as a reigning
    ideology) but a relation (\"justice\"; how people are to be treated, etc.).  By
    definition, this sort of thing cannot be a new founding idea, but it can be the
    horizon one looks toward...  *[Austria, anyone?]"

  content: "Well, the two-nation theory got murdered in the fields of East Bengal
    and nothing will resucistate it now, I think. The problem is that imo, Pakistan
    was clearly imagined as a homeland not just for Muslims but for South Asian Muslims
    and this has led to a bitter relationship with India and created internal problems.
    IMO these are the two  main challenges that any drastic re-imaginging of Pakistani
    nationalism will require. As Q points out the problem with having a secular state
    as opposed to a Hindu one is that implicitly it undermines the whole rationale
    for having a separate Muslim state; which is why I can well imagine that the Advani-Vajyapayee
    ilk of Hindu nationalism is easier to reconcile for ardent Pakistani nationalists
    (the deluded ramblings of the Akhand Bharat crowd amongst the saffronists notwithstainding)
    than the secular Indian one. There needs to be a break with this vision of Pakistan
    because quite simply it isn't accurate and will not be accurate from a regional
    perspective. Religion alone cannot form the basis of nationhood in our region.  The
    other internal problem is also serious. The twin aspects of this is the role of
    the Army-Bureacracy--Judiciary nexus that ran Pakistan for so long along with
    the dominant proprieatary feudal and industrial classes; without any real reform
    or redistribution of political and economic power downwards and secondly the concentration
    of political power through the state in the hands of Punjab and the Punjabis.
    Effective federalism and decentralisation of power; which allows other states
    and ethnic groups to have an equitable stake in the state and the resources generated
    by the Public sector and the economy is a must. This is the lesson that canbe
    learnt from India, anways, which has been able to incorporate irredentism when
    giving it a share of power (Tamilnad, Assam, Punjab) with some success and failed
    miserably where it has not (Kashmir, Northeast).   I too had fond hopes
    of some sort of United States of South Asia confederacy at some point in the future
    for the erstwhile successor states but this is less likely; in my view at least
    partly because of Indian instransigence regarding smaller neighbours and the inability
    to realise that being the regional dominant power means that one cannot expect
    quid-pro-quo to be the nature of biltaral relations with smaller neighbours. This
    unrealistic attitude, combined with either internal meddling or unaccomodative
    stances is what turns SAARC meetings into ones where most of the smaller states
    align themselves together against India. More maturity and far-sightedness is
    needed from the Indian side for this to become a possibility otherwise it will
    simply become an exercise in hegemony."

    generally about Indian hegemony in South Asia, and the angst many feel against
    the Indian goverment's interference. Governments, however, have been more or less
    willing to cooperate with India in many different aspects. This is not to say
    that the relationships are all that equal between India and the others, but I
    also know that in some cases, countries like Nepal and Bhutan often depend on
    India (and vice versa) for economic reasons. So I don't think the climate is all
    that entirely hostile as your comment paints it here; I tend to think that the
    worst government relations between India and anyone else is the Indo-Pak one (also,
    I really like many people discount some of the positive steps that have been taken
    by the two countries, though they do not represent a large and radical change.
    Take for instance the moves to open up commerce between the Pak and Indo Kashmirs.
    There are other examples; and I am willing to say that some of these \"positive\"
    overtures often turn out to be mere gesture. But still.)"

    here has, would be great to hear thoughts in the context of this discussion\"  I
    can't seem to track down the website at the moment, but I came across one that
    portrays- or explains, rather--Pakistan as a \"natural\" entity springing from
    the Indus civilization; there were several lines that straight out said Pakistan
    is not an artificially constructed nation and it did not begin in 1947, but that
    it has existed all this time, and it is the 'natural' homeland of Punjabis, Pathans,
    Sindhis, etc. Interestingly, it bases this theory mostly on archaeological findings
    and ancient history regarding the Indus valley, but somehow managed to cleanse
    it of its pagan (?) origins; when it did discuss it, it launched into an abrupt
    tirade against the caste system, etc. Buddhism was given a better review (which
    reminds me, Buddhism seems to acquire a lot more genuine interest than Hinduism
    does from the Pakistanis I know. Not that this is bad, just an observation).  \"from
    the fact that Pakistanis, Israelis, and Americans THEMSELVES do not really see
    their nation-state as natural, the way Germans do; and is not a philosophical
    difference.\"  I am  not sure about this. Israelis DO try to stake their
    nation-state as \"natural\" (as the highly politicized interplay of Biblical studies,
    archaeology, and genetic studies testify), and some Israelis are driven by their
    sense that the State of Israel is natural (which then justifies the colonialism
    and landgrabbing), and Anglo Americans may recognize that their ancestors came
    from Europe, but that doesn't stop the wave of 'nativism' that is apparent amongst
    some Anglo Americans, and the sense that America IS their natural nation-state.  And
    tied into this, it's interesting how much the lens of Partition and its religious
    politics can shape this discussion about what it means to be \"Pakistani\", what
    the \"purpose\" of Pakistan is and should be, as if Pakistan is the only plagued
    by its relative infancy, and its religious, regional, and linguistic politics,
    with respects to, say, other countries. Lest we forget, India too is a very recent
    nation-state, and it also has been borne out of arguably artificial constructs,
    like language, ethnic background, land, religion (in India's case, the nation-state
    myth has been that India has been home to various religions, both ancient and
    recent) and which has thrown together a bunch of disparate groups and vivisected
    other once-cohesive communities. So have the other nations in South Asia, and
    it is precisely this very recent formation  of these countries that has led to
    struggles, clashes with the \"Center,\" etc. So IMO, many other nations have gone
    through similar battles (including nation-states older than India and Pakistan).
    But India has somehow managed to come up with a pluralist vision/myth (even if
    this is contested by others); Nepal is on its way and claims to want a similar
    set up to accommodate its immense diversities. Some other nation-states in South
    Asia (like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, to a lesser extent the Maldives) have been less
    successful in forging a diversity narrative (NOTE: the existence of this pluralist
    myth does NOT mean that it is reality, that it is successful, or even accepted
    by segments of the population. See India as a case in point). Not sure if I
    am making sense (brain has been muddled after a 6 AM to 7PM day), but just wanted
    to throw my thoughts out there."

  content: "Sepoy:  \"There is a world of difference between &ldquo;Taliban&rdquo;
    and any given Pakistani citizen, even the most devout believer. The Taliban, strictly
    understood to be warlords operating with or in support of Mullah Omar, are a very
    particular political group. They _are_ political. They _have_political goals.
    They are not, in effect, a religious ideology that has the danger of sweeping
    Pakistan. They don't have doctrinarians or theologians. Al-Qaeda
    does. Taliban don't. It may seem like splitting hairs but I
    think it is very important to differentiate between the historically situated
    Taliban and the groups that have emerged in Pakistan bearing the name &ldquo;Taliban&rdquo;.\"  1.
    I agree there is a HUGE difference between a devout believer and Taliban, and
    moreover differentiating between the various groups. But I do not know how condusive--as
    important as your distinction is regarding the fact that they are a political
    group lacking religious doctrines/theologians. AQ may have that, but they are
    also a political group and have political aims like the Taliban.   Most
    importantly, it is disturbing how some will justify or try to assess the Taliban's
    actions in Pakistan based on the Koran. What I'm trying to say is that the problem
    IMO is not so much as a Taliban takeover (or the fear of it), but the fact that
    every single thing is sometimes susceptible to validation or refutation of what
    is \"acceptable\" in Islamic doctrines, regardless of whether we are talking about
    positive principles (democracy, allowing diversity, fraternity, and so on) or
    Sharia laws which have negative components to it--and this goes for seemingly
    innocuous phrases like \"This is not Islam\" when certain punishments are meted
    out according to the Sharia.  Like does it matter that whether flogging is an
    acceptable \"punishment\" for \"improper\" behavior according to the Sharia? Maybe
    it is sanctioned, maybe it is not; that is not the point and it's besides the
    point, but some other folks think otherwise. I don't have any smart answer on
    how to fix this except to say massive educational reform, changing the dialogue
    on a national level where religion is slowly removed from the equation and the
    focus is more on instituting and practicing several common principles (like socio-economic
    betterment, blah blah)."

  content: "Desi Italiana: Glad you raised the points you did in the last paragraph
    of comment #20; I can empathize, as I too have felt a similar frustration (i.e.
    the point isn't \"this isn't Islam\", because the bandying about of this hackneyed
    phrase risks both, a collective evasion of any responsibility (the category called
    \"Islam\" need never be examined, because everything unpleasant is simply defined
    out of it); AND even the perpetuation of all sorts of conspiracy theories (\"it
    couldn't possibly be Muslims who bombed this mosque\").  [On that second point,
    and tangentially: I was struck by the slippage of one to the other when I heard
    a BBC news report in the wake of a suicide attack at a mosque near a NATO supply
    route -- the BBC interviewed a local official, who was understandably upset, and
    kept saying (in response to a question as to what the local people were saying
    about the attack), that \"those who have done this are not Muslims.\"  I felt
    I had no way of knowing what he was referring to, i.e. whether the Taliban/Al
    Qaida-types were evil folks beyond the pale of Islam, OR whether the perpetrators
    were India, US, Israel, etc.]  It is the prestige of the notion that there is
    only one correct interpretation of Islam that must be questioned -- the liberals
    who say \"x is not Islam\" are not undermining the prestige of this notion, because
    they are reinforcing the notion that there IS one correct notion.  On that terrain,
    the liberals/seculars etc. will never be able to compete with the seemingly greater
    \"authenticity\" of the bearded ideologues.  That being said, we will also
    have to face the obvious: the liberals/secular-types simply lack the cultural
    credibility to make this argument.  Someone like me, who is not at all religiously
    observant, cannot make this case.  And the legacy of colonialism is such that
    the \"metropolitans\" do not even share a language -- of faith, and to a large
    extent even in the literal linguistic sense -- with those who have for the most
    part been mere \"subjects\" of the colonial order, and its nation-state heirs..."

  content: "<i>This is not to say that the relationships are all that equal between
    India and the others, but I also know that in some cases, countries like Nepal
    and Bhutan often depend on India (and vice versa) for economic reasons. So I don't
    think the climate is all that entirely hostile as your comment paints it here;</i>   Well
    the problem here is two-fold. Just to respond to some of your comments though;
    Bhutan is a special case, given that we have effectively made it a protectorate
    and it has to defer to Delhi on Defence and external relations. Nepal too is constrained
    by the fact that almost all the major transit route for trade go through India
    and these can be sht off effectively isolating Nepal in economic terms from the
    outside world. Something that was done in the latem 1980s much to Nepali consternation
    and the 1950 Friendship treaty has caused no end of irritate to Nepalis politicans.
    No major Nepali party from the NC to the Maoists is well disposed towards India
    and Indians shouls ask why this is the case. Similarly, one can think of Bangladesh
    where it took only a few years for Mujib to become anatagonistic towards India
    and where today no major politician can be afford to be seen to be \"soft\" on
    India. This despite the instrumental role India played in its creation. OF Sri
    Lanka I will not speak, since the IPKF fiasco says it all.  Our MEA mandarins
    tried to seel the intervention to restore Gayoom in the Maldives as a successful
    forieng policy venture but now it seems we were propping up a corrupt and unpopulas
    dicatator. Though the only good thing to come out of this is that Maldives is
    one of the few countries we have very good relations with and where visa restrictions
    for Indian citizens have been abolished.  Part of the problem is tha natural
    'big brother' pehnomenon and the fear of being swamped by a bigger and more powerful
    neighbour. Part is also down to the fact that all SAARC countries have borders
    with India and not with each other; so disputes naturally tend to take on a Indo-centric
    affair. however, Indian policy which could have alleviated or addressed these
    fears has not done so. Instead we have pursued a policy of what some scholars
    have called 'relation control' whereby we have sought to influence, usually indirectly,
    the internal regimes of neighbouring states and asserted our dominance over them.
    In negotiations instead of realising that quid-pro-quo are not suitable basis
    of biltaral relations when such large power imbalances exist; we have insisted
    on the facade of equal treatment on a range of issues. When there is an attempt
    to break this pattern and go down a more enlightened route such as the \"Gujral
    Doctrine\" it is vilifed as somehow selling out Indian interests. This short-sighted
    approach has reinforced prejudices and fears of Indian policies and intentions
    instead of diffusing them.  We need to distinguish between the state, the
    nation and the people at large. I would say while there is a lot of regard and
    good feelings for Indians as a people amongst neigbouring peoples; there is much
    less so of India as a nation or Indian nationalism and as regards the Indian state
    and its policies there is downright hostility. This is a state of affairs that
    needs to be changed."

    it is not just Pakistan where the proximity of India leads to political anxiety.  because
    all of the post-colonial borders in the sub-continent do not track etnic divisions,
    etc. cleanly, all of the successor-states have some kind of anxiety about India,
    making poor relations that much more likely.  Thus, Nepal cannot help but wonder
    about the "logic" of Nepal in a world where India has more Nepali-speakers than
    Nepal does; and Bhutan cannot be indifferent to the fate of Sikkim; and Bangladesh
    perhaps faces the most problematic ideological issue of all: vis-a-vis the idea
    of Pakistan, Bengali nationalism is the bulwark, but that very same bulwark becomes
    the ideological fifth column vis-a-vis India/West Bengal (aside: that is why I
    do not agree that the two nation theory was killed in 1971; rather, it has led
    to a fascinating oscillation for Bangladesh, between the poles of "secular identity"
    and "two nation theory".  This is an under-analyzed perspective, but one that
    fascinates me: Bangladesh is the one country in South Asia that is simultaneously
    "like" India as well as Pakistan, or at least so it seems to me as a provisional
    matter); with Sri Lanka, of course, the problem is two-fold: India has to be "pro-Tamil"
    because of its own Tamil population, and "anti-Tamil" inasmuch as a successful
    Tamil separatist movement would cause grave concerns for India vis-a-vis Tamil

  content: "Ok. I've been waiting until I had time to give this
    post (posts?) its deserved attention.  About people saying &ldquo;this
    is not Islam&rdquo; I really think people need to get to a better dialogue
    on such issues. Sure, you can say it's not Islam. But that
    doesn't change what happened and the fact that some other people
    might disagree (vehemenantly). People can't cling to what is/isn't
    Islam because 1st, who cares, that's beyond the point, or,
    at least, only a part of it, and 2nd that's not going to solve
    the real issues.  On the topic of Sharia, I think it has to be approached
    in a totally different way. I think that using the Qur'an to
    map out a society, with human rights, civil liberties, and a democracy, is wholly
    feasible. Now, I am not a fan of much of the shari'a that has
    been created and maintained in many countries, but I think an open dialogue about
    sharia in Pakistan and what it could mean might be beneficial. I think a reformed
    sharia could work in Pakistan, not that I think that that's
    the best solution but a solution. Many people would feel more comfortable with
    the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state. Now this goes back to what sepoy said
    — what kind of Muslim state is Pakistan? Well, many thought,
    a home land for South Asian Muslims. But there are so many problems with that
    — Islam could have been wholly accepted as just another part
    of India if many didn't view it as a conqueror but as another
    part of India's tapestry, like the Parsis. But it did, and
    some say Hinduism as a formal school of religious thought was formulated as a
    response to the foreign incursense of powerful Islam (I don't
    think I'd go that far). SO there has always been that unsettling
    factor — But the fact remains, India IS secular and not every
    Pakistani IS a Muslim or Sunni for that matter.  And this goes back to the
    question of how logical it is to create a nation on the basis of religion or ethnicity
    (Israel anyone?) I have always had an aversion to nationalism (when I was much
    younger, I thought I'd give up my citizenships —
    but then I realized the absurdities involved), but the fact is that Pakistan is
    a nation and a nation needs to have some sense of what it is. I think that people
    (and by people I'm referring to Pakistanis) should strive to
    put an end to sectarianism (Kerala anyone?) while recognizing those differences
    and either embracing or tolerating them. The hard part — as
    always — is taking a hard look at the past and realizing the
    lies that almost all nations have been partly built on. In Pakistan's
    case, this deals with partition and coming to terms to what it was —
    an artificial, hasty, ill-thought out, world-changing event. This is hard for
    all nations to do — I'm still waiting to
    see a great film about American slavery but that kind of national baggage is uncomfortable
    for people tied into identity politics. I think that Pakistan needs to recognize
    and come to terms with its diversity while recognizing that all Pakistanis do
    share some common culture and that can propel and stronger national image. I am,
    on the whole, against the whole concept of nationalism, but we humans have got
    to make do with what we have.  So Pakistan still does have a common culture,
    even though it's a tapestry of culture. This might sound lame,
    but I think reinforcing that tapestry and weaving it together is something that
    should be undertaken.  There's still the question of
    India. Qalander made a good point talking about people being able to play the
    religious/idealilogical card if they take partition as a given. I think it's
    important to have a growing dialogue about the mistakes and assumations made during
    partition and in such idealoguey (Romila Thapur anyone http://www.amazon.com/Early-India-Origins-AD-1300/dp/0520242254/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1240028393&amp;sr=8-1
    ?) to realize how people in South Asia got to where they have now. Conrad said
    that there's the natural big brother mentally with India, and
    I think that the consolidation of whatever national identity is possible can help
    curtail those feelings (though that is a problem). Desi Italiana also mentioned
    India and how it passes itself off as plural — it may not be
    plural now, but it's going to have to be if it wants to prosper
    and Pakistan is going to have to be if it wants to survive  However, I think
    that there's a deeper problem. I think that it lies with corruption,
    education, and equality — Amartya Sen made a good point in
    an essay on nuclear weapons — some people in Pak or India talk
    about nuking the other without even realizing what it really means to use a nuclear
    weapon, like most people don't. He cites an article Arundhati
    Roy wrote (The End of Imagination) and said that people can't
    fully comprehend such destruction and that many of these are the very people their
    govs have not done enough for (jobs, etc). As long as there is misery, there will
    be dissent, and when there's dissent, there's
    the possibility of terrorism. Pakistan has to unify (which it does in varying
    degrees) but more importantly the government has to take care of these problems
    — stop landgrabs, put the military under the government, reporters
    should root out gov corruption, I don't know, it all sounds
    impossible for any country. But improvements have been made in some areas (like
    civil protests against Mussharaf) but there needs to be more and they need to
    happen fast.  (By the way, I'm not calling for Sharia
    law, but think that a reformed form of Sharia could work in Pakistan. And there
    will be South Asian Union — just not in out lifetime.)"

    political negotiations to get a cease-fire.\"  Is Obama administration making
    any headway in regards to negotiations with the \"moderate Taliban\"? Last I heard
    of it was March 8, 2009 NY Times article and then the subsequent public rebuff
    by Taliban. Public rebuff doesn't mean, that there are no closed-door contacts.  I
    think that until Afghanistan needs is resolved, it will be difficult for Pakistan
    to contain Pakistani \"Taliban\". Tariq Ali suggested last year that the way out
    of Afghanistan \"would require a withdrawal of all us forces, either preceded
    or followed by a regional pact to guarantee Afghan stability for the next ten
    years. Pakistan, Iran, India, Russia and, possibly, China could guarantee and
    support a functioning national government\" http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&amp;view=2713 Barnett
    R. Rubin and Ahmed Rashid suggested a similar approach in a Foreign Affairs article
    (\"From Great Game to Grand Bargain\")in late December 2008. Getting as diverse
    a star cast as Pakistan, Iran, India, Russia and, China to sit at a table and
    agree on a viable solution seem like an arduous task. But what are the alternatives?
    A continued stalemate is unsustainable for a long period of time for the US, while
    a Talibanate next door to Pakistan is perhaps not the kind of neighbor Pakistan
    would want."

  content: "i am fascinated by this discussion mainly because at college in LUMS,
    it was perhaps my primary intellectual obsession.  one thing i had realised
    was that pakistan needed to create a good identity myth, which india and all other
    nation states have to do, and have done. our myth is comically and tragically
    flawed.  i think the pakistan that was imagined was one which was supposed
    to be culturally muslim. because there is a notable difference in people who are
    culturally muslim (for a vague description, c0nsider Zia Mohiyuddin and any other
    Lucknow type) verse people who are practicing muslims. the problem was that there
    was a lot of cultural difference between the urban, north indian muslims who propogated
    the theory, and the people who actually live in what became pakistan.  at
    this point, most of us are aware we have an identity crisis, but no one can come
    up with how to solve it. i think before we construct an identity, we should all
    work at trying to reconnect that historical severance which happened at partition,
    and in 71, and under zia. we have no connection with our actual past.   fucking
    mohmmad bin qasim has nothing in common with anyone of us, yet that's where our
    official historical narrative begins.  it might sound silly at a forum like
    chappati mystery, but when revisionist accounts of partition were first taught
    at LUMS, there was a furore. and lots of students were profoundly influenced and
    actually became more invested in pakistan, even while some in the minority became
    really insecure and defensive. the reason being that no one had ever heard or
    even thought of an account of history like the one hamza alvi or ayesha siddiqa
    were providing.  yet ironically, it made many of us love pakistan more, because
    at least now we had a better idea of its true reality.  there is so much
    beauty in our shared culture, and i have repeatedly seen that when it is invoked
    pakistanis of all sorts become really interested. they love to hear about the
    artistic logic behind decorating trucks, or the dances of the sheedis, or the
    kafis of abida perveen, even when they lack the knowledge to understand these
    things. because such connections occur at an intrinsic level.   ultimately,
    the goal is to make us better human beings, not better pakistanis, because the
    as has been repeatedly mentioned, the nation state is a lie. but to get to this
    point, of being better humans, we need to cross the point of being better pakistanis,
    otherwise we would all be engulfed in a delibitating crisis.  PS - that
    book on the indus civilization is written by Aitzaz Ahsan. you all know him as
    the leader of the lawyer's movement."

  content: "<i>aside: that is why I do not agree that the two nation theory was killed
    in 1971</i>  Q, let me clarify myself; I would say that the two-nation theory
    Jinnah would see it of there being two-nations in South Asia (or British India
    to be more accurate) that of Hindus and Muslims and the consequent implication
    that each would need their own state - is pretty much decisviely dead. The reality
    is that there are several nationalities in the region contained within a much
    smaller number of states. I don't think 'Muslims' or 'Hindus' have ever formed
    'nations' since both categories themselves contain conteding nationalities. How
    India and Pakistan as states deal with these nationalities will be an important
    aspect of the future."

  content: "@ sepoy  with regards to the furore, the first one happened when
    we were introduced to the idea that the whole freedom movement was engineered
    by influential muslim elites in muslim minority provinces. hamza alvi had a term
    for them, the salariat classes i believe. it certainly had all the mohajirs torn
    between confusion and pride. the rest of the students weren't too happy about
    the evidence that their provinces were really not interested in the idea of pakistan.
    and the best was the look on the mullahs' faces when they realised that maududi
    and co. were against partition full stop.  but the best was post partition
    history. we were doing secessionist movements when one of the lahori girls turned
    around and said \"but sir, why do they all hate us punjabis?\" chaos ensued, as
    you can imagine. good fun :)"

<p>The Pakistani Parliament has now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7996560.stm">passed</a> the bill authorizing Shari'a laws in Swat - and perhaps in other territories. Punjab, according to the NYT report, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/world/asia/14punjab.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">United Militants Threaten Pakistan's Populous Heart</a> is also in grave danger of going Islamic in a meta-way. Baluchistan has broken out into <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g_M6ozOb7Z5YHVjwlLzLChP62rtQ">violence and protests</a> since the president of the Baluch National Movement, Mir Ghulam Mohammad, was kidnapped (along with two other senior associates), shot to death and then their bodies ditched from a helicopter. The primary suspicion falls upon the military or military intelligence. That leaves us Sindh. Karachi, the biggest city in Pakistan, is having a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/04/12/pakistan.music/">battle of the bands</a>. More seriously, it is also been the scene for ethnic riots against the Baluchi recently.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, the Obama administration has, to this point, authorized over 60 drone attacks for an <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=21440">al-Qaeda kill rate of 2%</a>. Wonderful. </p>
<p>So, given all this, is there a likelihood of an Islamic Revolution in Pakistan? Is it <a href="http://thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=170495">Game Over?</a><br />
<!--more--><br />
Before we get there, I want to review a couple more things about Pakistan and its relationship with its constitutive parts. Swat merged with Pakistan, constitutionally speaking, in 1969. However, it has retained the status as a "Special Area" granted under the Yahya Khan One Unit proclamation of 1955. This special status was is recorded into the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch3.html">'73 Constitution</a>, Article 247. According to this status, they are free to make their own laws and govern themselves. The President can, from "time to time", give some directions to the Governor but the Parliament, Supreme Court or any High Court has no jurisdiction. So, the Swat "Shari'a" deal is a capitulation insofar as Pakistan has never amended its Constitution to make the FATA territories squarely under its law. Additionally, the Swat deal seems to be the only way to curb Maulana Fazlullah. If Obama is going to talk about "good Taliban" in Afghanistan, Pakistan certainly has the right to make political negotiations to get a cease-fire. The human impact of the last 3 years on Swat valley has been intense - over 300,000 have fled.</p>
<p>Baluchistan, another princely state which was militarily merged with Pakistan after Partition, had no role in the federal state. After the 1955 One Unit Proclamation, the Khan of Kalat tried again to declare sovereignty. General Tikka Khan ("the butcher of Bengal") was sent to Baluchistan in 1958 under Ayub's military rule to enforce federal writ. Things simmered until Bhutto has to send more army troops against another militant uprising in the region from '72-'74. So, there is no love lost between the center and Baluchistan. </p>
<p>Sindh, Karachi, and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) are another beeswax. Only recently, rumors were afloat that Musharraf was cutting a deal with MQM and give them autonomy under a federated Pakistan. </p>
<p>Now, to return to this "question". I would argue that such a formulation of impending doom is one of the main reason Pakistan is in this mess. There is a rich vein of "Pakistan on the Brink" theorization that has dominated US foreign policy since the 50s. Back then, it was the Communist revolution, and now it is the Islamic one. This particular mind-set has propelled one disastrous policy over another for the last 40 years. We have supported dictator after dictator and stood by, silently, when civilian regimes floundered under internal economic and political crises. Once again, this question dominates the Obama policy and will restrict any real re-thinking of the Pakistan issue or re-evaluation of the regional scene. So, let's just categorically understand that:</p>
<p>1. There is a world of difference between "Taliban" and any given Pakistani citizen, even the most devout believer. The Taliban, strictly understood to be warlords operating with or in support of Mullah Omar, are a very particular political group. They _are_ political. They _have_political goals. They are not, in effect, a religious ideology that has the danger of sweeping Pakistan. They don't have doctrinarians or theologians. Al-Qaeda does. Taliban don't. It may seem like splitting hairs but I think it is very important to differentiate between the historically situated Taliban and the groups that have emerged in Pakistan bearing the name "Taliban". In the later case, the term is actually masking other political goals and differences that we need to be carefully attuned to. Similarly speaking, there is a world of difference between a specific political group, however broadly defined, which can be numbered in the thousands and a state of 160-plus million peoples. The people of Pakistan have demonstrated, through a number of elections over the last 60 years, that they do not want their religious leaders in political power. There is no dismissing that reality. </p>
<p>2. The most powerful entity in Pakistan in its national army. The second most powerful entity is its civil bureaucracy. The third most powerful are the landed and industrial elite. None of these entities are about to give it up (whatever "it" is - from nukes to bank accounts) to some ragtag bunch of jihadis. Certainly Zardari, wants to keep everything, don't you know it.</p>
<p>3. There is a robust, active, critical media. A media which has played a prominent role in some amazing events in civil and political theaters in the last 3 years. </p>
<p>So, I reject the premise in which the Swat Deal becomes a stepping stone to the "Talibanization" of Pakistan. </p>
<p>Second, Pakistan has always been the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Pakistan has always self-imagined itself to be a "homeland for Muslims". The question really is: what kind of a homeland? Saudi Arabia is a homeland for Muslims. It has Shari'a and a King. Malaysia is another homeland for Muslims - with a <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/4/3/nation/20090403201619&sec=nation">different</a> sort of emphasis. Turkey, with its emphatic secularism, falls on the far end of such a homeland for Muslim spectrum. Where does Pakistan fit in? And where does it intend to go? I think <i>that</i> is the more important question. What is Pakistan to Pakistanis now? Who is a Pakistani, in effect? As I pointed out in an earlier discussion on <a href="/archives/homistan/pakistan_day_2009.html">the idea of Pakistan</a>, there has to be a fundamental re-articulation of Pakistan as an entity, as a nation-state, within its constitutive parts. The urgency of this task is evident  - there are other claimants with answers. Claimants who carry guns and who can brutalize a population in the blink of an eye. There is also the United States agenda, which continues to treat Pakistan as nothing more than a client-state. Somewhere in this pincer, somewhere between the taliban and the drone, the Pakistanis have to begin forming a sense of their whole. I am not big on nationalism and I don't think that re-imagining Pakistan as a nation is an easy task, either. (( Sometime ago, I would have loved to see a future South Asia Union - akin to the EU - where Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka found themselves in harmony with our uncle India. What a difference a war on terror makes. )) But, I am not simply talking about some ideological mumbo-jumbo that Islamabad can cook-up.</p>
<p>The most crucial step is that the civilian federal state of Pakistan has to listen - really, actually, listen - to the people of FATA, the people of N.W.F.P, the people of Baluchistan, the people of Sindh and the people of Punjab. It has to provide its citizens with basic security, shelter and welfare. It needs to protect its citizens from terrorism. It needs to strengthen its civic engagement with non-governmental organizations. It needs to ensure that basic human rights and access to a basic educational system is guaranteed to all citizens. These are actions that can be taken and should be taken and they will have a far greater impact than any 1.5 billion dollar aid. The Pakistan military, and the US, must allow for this. It must enable the state, it must pressure the state to fulfill its pledges to the people. Part of that means a military operation against the Taliban (narrowly defined) and al-Qaeda (defined as "foreign fighters" in the press) in Swat and in Baluchistan. This must be under-taken by the Pakistan military. </p>
<p>From such a process, a major process of stabilization, the state can start to re-build. It's a tall order, I know. There are too many de-stabilizing forces. Not to mention, an open question mark over whether there is actual political will to do all this. Yet, I remain hopeful. Pakistanis - however we categorize them - have a lot of heart, a lot of soul and great fortitude. For the last 8 years, they have been paying the price of a proxy-war waged on their soil. A decade before, they suffered through another proxy-war which gave them millions of refugees and a radicalizing ideology. They have persevered. I am still in awe of the hundreds of thousands who galvanized against Musharraf and the millions who cast a vote in the election last year. We must support those many millions in taking the next step. </p>
