  content: i think so that every one has rights to protest and afghans have it to
    but its not the way to shoot them out to get rid of the protest . nato should  Liston
    to the people of Afghanistan and come to a solution instead of just winning there
    war with weapons. and the mosque is a symbol of Islam and Muslim say it the every
    mosque is the home of Allah so we can see why they are angry

  content: "&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It is clear that the fundamental principle laid down
    in the Qur&acirc;&euro;&trade;an is the principle of election; the details or
    rather the translation of this principle into a workable scheme of Government
    is left to be determined by other considerations.&acirc;&euro;\x9D - Muhammad
    Iqbal (PUH)\r\n\r\nI have problems with some of Iqbal's ideas, mainly his monolithic
    and problamatic view of Islam as too singular an entity, but it should be pointed
    out that he did accept some forms of democracy.\r\n\r\nI got that quote from this
    paper: http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/oct01/03.htm"
