  content: Yes John Stewart is the shit. Watch him take apart Christopher Hitchens.
    Letterman may appeal to someone who doesn't follow politics, but those are the
    kinds of people that people like O Reilly thrive on.

  content: "Jon Stewart interviewing O'Reilly. \nhttp://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/videos/celebrity_interviews/index.jhtml?start=17 Jon
    Stewart taking apart Hitchens.\nhttp://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/videos/celebrity_interviews/index.jhtml?start=33 The
    right-wing blogosphere is already slaying Letterman, pointing to liberal bias
    etc. No one goes after Jon Stewart because despite his claim to do only comedy,
    his political points are quite incisive. Tucker Carlson tried and was taken part.
    \nCan't wait to see him hosting the Oscars!"
