    i vote sven first leader of the "true believers".

    would the religion have a good / evil side? oprah being "good" and <a href="http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2001/10/26/franzen_winfrey/index.html" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Franzen</a> and the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9802/05/oprah.beef/" rel="nofollow">beef industry</a> being unholy?

    or would we all just keep coming back as audience members until we reach the pinnacle of oprah-ness?

<p><img src="/img/oprah.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>In class, we are tackling the life of the Prophet. The framework that I have applied is to ground the <i>sira</i> in the context of Holy Men in Late Antiquity. Basically, we read selections from Peter Brown, Averill Cameron and some primary Desert Father texts. I wanted to give the students a sense of the, shall we say, milieu. So, today, in addition to all that I introduced Weber's charismatic leader (with hopes that I can employ the routinization process later). So, I ask the class to give me some examples of a charismatic leader. Hitler. Ho Chi Minh. Great. But how about some uplifting examples? chirp. chirp. Clinton! ok. Lets see what makes him a charis...OPRAH! comes a cry. Yeah, yeah, others chime in. Quite remarkable.<br />
In 200 years, my friends, there will be a faith, a religion, a church of Oprah. People believe. They do. She must, of course, ascend to Heaven first. But it will happen.</p>
<p>As I was listening to the class go through Weber's schematic using Oprah, I found myself thinking that if that does happen...what kind of source material would be there to construct a hagiography? Her t.v. show, magazine and books, of course. But routinization of her charisma demands that it depersonalize and transmit itself - acolytes? disciples? faithful? believers? What about miracles? She rescued books. That's a miracle in my, uh, book. When can we expect to see more miraculous output reported as such? Oprah cures blindness. I don't follow Oprah so I don't know. Maybe <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/000036.html">sven</a> knows.</p>
<p>Hagiographies are a funny things to teach. The class seems to want to either question each motive or question the source. They have a notion that being critical means to nit-pick, to rip. I want them to embrace the narrative and see what the tropes are; what function they serve; how they construct an identity for the believer. Are we finding the truth in this class? I asked.<br />
As an assignment I am giving them the story of the <a href="http://www.imagesonline.bl.uk/britishlibrary/controller/subjectidsearch?id=10145&idx=1&start=8">Ascension</a>. It is the most fantastic element in the biography of the Prophet. I am very curious to see how they deal with it.</p>
