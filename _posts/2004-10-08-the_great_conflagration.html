<p><img src="/img/olearycow.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>On October 8, 1871, a fire started in or around Mrs. Kate O'Leary's barn on 37 DeKoven Street on Chicago's West Side and over the course of the next three days wiped out most of the rollicking business district of the city by the Lake. 300 Chicagoans died, 90,000 lost their homes, and the property loss was $200 million.</p>
<p>&shy;<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/SiteChicagoFire.html">Here</a> is the site where the fire started.<br />
&shy;<a href="http://www.thechicagofire.com/">Here</a> are some questions answered about the Chicago Fire - particularly whether Daisy did it or not?<br />
&shy;<a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20040301/comet.html">Or</a> maybe comets did it?<br />
&shy;<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/ChicagoFire.html">Here</a> is an eye-witness account published in the Chicago Tribune on October 14, 1871.<br />
&shy;<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngkids/9809/chicago/chicago.html">Here</a> is a kid's site about the Fire that has cute illustrations that I like.<br />
&shy;And <a href="http://www.chicagohs.org/fire/intro/">here</a> is the Chicago Historical Society doing what it does.<br />
&shy;Best of all, is this <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;sid=66f72bb923dd19f97fd3bb7bf9386b3f;rgn=full%20text;idno=AJA3018.0001.001;view=image;seq=0003">book</a> from the Library of Congress' archive of 19th century books in print entitled, "Chicago and the Great Conflagration" by Ellias Colbert and Everett Chamberlin. With numerous illustrations by Chapin & Gulick, from photographic views taken on the spot! God bless L.O.C.</p>
