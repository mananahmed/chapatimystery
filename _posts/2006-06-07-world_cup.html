  content: "FIFA, functioning under new rules that calls for the expansion of the
    World Cup pool from 32 to 36 teams, drafted in the four top countries that failed
    to qualify for the competition:  Turkey, Ireland, Nigeria and Cameroon. The move
    was pushed through by officials eager to see the best quality represented at the
    showpiece of World Football.\n\n \n\nThe news was greeted with relief by the selcted
    countries, and there was celebration on the streets of Istanbul, Dublin, Lagos
    and Yaounde. Irish winger Damien Duff hailed the move, as did Nigerian striker
    Yakubu Aiyegbeni. \"This gives us a chance to show the world how much we've improved,\"
    Aiyegbeni said, \"I think we could get as far as the semi-finals this time. We're
    not afraid of Brazil. We're not afraid of anyone.\"\n\n \n\nAnd that was when
    I woke up, that was when I woke up in the darkness of my bedroom, with an empty
    and sad feeling in my stomach. The World Cup starts in two days and, to be honest,
    I can't support any team whole-heartedly, or even half-heartedly. Nigeria is not
    going. It still seems incredible. Say it ain't so. But that's the reality. Nigeria
    is not going to be at the World Cup. And Togo is. \n\n \n\nWhat will I do with
    myself over the next four years while I wait?"

    Via the world cup blogs, I've learned about the "livefooty" site which, as the world cup blog describes, has been beaming friendlies "onto your computers by Chinese pirates via Israel." If you have IE and Windows, you can use one of their streams. I watched a French team that will hobble into the second round fall apart against China yesterday until a pair of flukey gift goals in injury time. They're also working on figuring out how you can spoof your IP to a UK location so that you can take advantage of BBC's free streaming of every match. As the post on youtube and livefooty ends, so will I:



    "What a great time to be alive."

<p>At some point in the future, I will reminisce about my world cup watching pasts [saw Sweden-Brazil in the Pontiac Dome in '94!] but for now, I would just like to point out that the lion w/ the gaping mouth football is, indisputably, the most disturbing mascot evah!</p>
