  content: "Re: \"I need to furnish a lot more context of the 19th c. city into a
    course I am planning for next term.\"  Is this a course on Hyderabad, or
    a course on the nineteenth century city in India?  Thanks for the shout!"

<p>I recently picked up <em>Hyderabad: A Biography</em> by Narendra Luther but gave up a little too soon into it. I need to furnish a lot more context of the 19th c. city into a course I am planning for next term. A classic in the field is Margit Pernau's <em>The Passing of Patrimonialism: Politics and Political Culture in Hyderabad, 1911-1948</em> (2000). CM friend Qalandar has recently produced an enviable review essay on the <a href="http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2009/09/book-review-passing-of-patrimonialism.html">book</a>. I highly recommend reading it. </p>
