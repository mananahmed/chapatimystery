  content: It was  beautiful, however, many of these amazing visuals were lifted from
    other filmmakers' and photographers' previous work. See <i>Baraka</i>.

<p><img src="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/tarsemthefall.png" width="150" />I highly recommend that you go out and watch Tarsem Singh Dhabdwar's <a href="http://thefallthemovie.com/">The Fall</a>. Think of it as a companion piece to del Toro's <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i> - obsessed with stories, story-tellers and the corrosive realities that surround them both. I was hesitant to go see it, until I read Ebert's <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080603/PEOPLE/868926055">interview</a> with Tarsem (worth reading every line) and the details of the amazing on-location filming and the commitment to his vision. Also worth reading is another <a href="http://www.ioncinema.com/news.php?nid=2896">interview</a> with ion-cinema (as well as these <a href="http://www.gotterdammerung.org/film/reviews/y/yo-ho-ho.html">tid-bits</a> about the framing device). It is not a film upon which you can hang too heavy an analytic curtain - the story and the sub-text is simple enough but it does contains some traces of a quixotic endeavor that is endearing. So, yeah. Oh, the visuals are amazing (especially of Jodhpur and the Jaipur <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulsikora/293366251/">observatory</a>). Go Tarsem and the power of a broken heart.</p>
