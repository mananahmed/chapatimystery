  content: "Sepoy, \r\nHistorians may have a long view of things, but be wary of falling
    into the trap of satisfying the \"lets bash America\" meme (well justified in
    many cases) while forgetting what limb of the tree your friends are sitting on
    back home (on the other hand, what I am about to say will offend all your academic
    friends, so I guess your choices are not easy either). An American withdrawal
    from Afghanistan will not be the end of the world from an American perspective
    (in fact, from a purely American perspective one can make a good case that America
    is wasting men, money and reputation in an enterprise whose main beneficiaries
    are regional powers like Iran, India, China and Russia). America carried on well
    enough after a much bigger and more humiliating defeat in Vietnam. But the loss
    will fry the ass of the new middle class in Afghanistan and Pakistan, who will
    then blame the Americans for coming in, blame the Americans for leaving, blame
    the Americans for the militants atrocities and finally, blame the Americans for
    their own demise.\r\nIf you are one of those whom the ISI has managed to convince
    that the good taliban (aka \"ISI-Friendly taliban\") should be allowed a share
    in Kabul in order to get a reasonable result, then I dont agree with you there
    either. The taliban will not follow that script. If the US abandons the current
    corrupt and incompetent Afghan govt and gets out (as they must once they make
    that first decision) the ISI will NOT be able to deliver on their promise of \"well
    behaved good taliban\". The entertainments in Kabul stadium will be extremely
    gory....\r\nThe time to negotiate with \"moderate taliban\" will be after they
    are no longer confident of victory. That time has not yet come. The current Afghan
    regime is the only game in town. Either make it work or get as far away from that
    area as possible. If the US pulls out, who do you think can stop the taliban then?
    India? Russia? China? Iran? Saudi Arabia?(they will all want to try, but they
    are not exactly set to cooperate and coordinate their efforts; there must be a
    Chinese lobby who are happy to see the jihadis bleed India, an Iranian lobby that
    is happy to see the jihadis bleed the USA, a Saudi lobby who think the suicidal
    virgin-hunters are the best weapon they have ever had and so on). This would be
    a long and ugly fight in the best of hands, but if GHQ is  still more focused
    on stopping civilian oversight in the Kerry-Lugar bill than it is on fighting
    the terrorists, property values in E-7 and Shadman are going to take a serious
    hit.\r\nPersonally, I think (or hope? wishful thinking?) that the tide has finally
    turned and GHQ is not completely blind to their own interests. The lifestyle of
    the rich and famous corps commanders will not survive a jihadi victory.  And there
    is no middle ground with the Jihadis. Either they win, or the infidels do."

  content: "Thanks Omar. I don't advocate a US pull-out. Neither do I advocate maintaining
    Karzai's puppet regime. U.S. had a chance to enforce fair elections - in a number
    of crucial mis-steps they dropped that ball. The repercussions are that there
    are no viable political alternative to the Afghan \"surge\". India/China/Iran
    can continue playing the retiring bride instead of showing up to the table. \r\n\r\nThe
    military options are simply bleak and bleaker. You are right about the US withdrawal
    doomsday. On the other hand, the US will never get enough troops to make a pointed
    difference, the Taliban can always regroup, and there is no civilian alternative
    to any of this.  More particularly, I am not entirely convinced that there is
    an Afghanistan \"state\" wherein such political or civilian alternatives can be
    espoused. \r\n\r\nNothing you wrote above will offend any academics I know, so
    sleep sound."

    You bring up the prospect of Kabul stadium but conveniently ignore all the atrocities
    that have come with  the second American intervention(First being against Russians),
    the slaughter of innocent civilians, bombing of weddings etc etc.\r\nThe election
    result is there for all to see. What is the political process there to bail out

  content: "I see no possibility of the Afghans being left alone by anyone. Its a
    classic vacuum and everyone around wants it filled with their favorite gas. I
    am actually not too hopeful of the USA sticking around for a hundred years or
    even 10 years. I think they will leave in less than 5, unless things go better
    than anyone expects. What I DO expect is that if the US pulls out before Pakistani
    Taliban are decisively defeated, then we will be back to Pakistan inserting its
    proxies in from the East and South and Iran and India supporting their proxies
    in the Northwest. Only this time, the Northern alliance has become much stronger,
    so the war will not end too quickly. They could literally fight to the last afghan.
    Since China has not yet taken over the role of global policeman (and no post-socialist,
    pan-human world government is in sight), the departure of the current (aging and
    bumbling) cop is likely to be followed by spectacular chaos.\r\n  Of course, there
    is no guarantee that the US would do a good job if they stayed. The following
    timeline is copied from another website and sure, things could go that way. American
    imperial interventions are not usually well managed. On the other hand, Afghans
    who are working with the new ANA are very confident and its possible that this
    time, the US will surprise you and actually make it work...btw, what is your position
    on Afghans who do want a US supported regime (they exist, I assure you, I know
    some of them)?\r\n1955 U.S. backs Ngo Dinh Diem to take control of S. Vietnam,
    defies U.N. mandate for Vietnamese unfication elections scheduled for 1956. Under
    U.S. pressure Diem holds highly suspect \"elections\" in 1959 to validate his
    presidency.\r\n1963 U.S. determines Ngo Dinh Diem is so corrupt he is intolerable,
    he is assassinated and replaced with a U.S. backed hunta that installs Nguyen
    Van Thieu. Who turns out to be much worse than Diem.\r\n1967 U.S. initiates Phoenix
    Program to \"neutralize\" Viet Cong shadow government officials in S. Vietnamese
    villages. Operatives are not too picky about who they pop. Somewhere around 1969
    \"rogue\" Phoenix operatoratives are alledged to have determined that the real
    problem was the corrupt local S. Vietnamese government officials and start popping
    them instead.\r\n1973 After 11 years of killing U.S. leaves Vietnam in disgrace
    and defeat. Many wonder why we ever went their and especially why we stayed so
    long. Many veterans claim \"the politicians lost that war, we were never beaten
    in battle!\" Not all is lost, war was a big boost for careerist miltary types,
    journalists and defense contractor profits.\r\n2002 U.S. installs Karzi who turns
    out to be highly corrupt. 2009 Karzi holds highly suspect \"elections\" to validate
    his presidency.\r\n20?? Karzi is assassinated and replaced with ??? ??? who turns
    out to be much worse than Karzi?\r\n20?? U.S. inintiates ???? Program to \"neutralize\"
    growing Taliban shadow government officials in Afghan villages?\r\n20?? \"rogue\"
    operatives from the ???? program determine the real problem is corrupt Afghan
    government officials start popping them instead?\r\n20?? After ?? years of killing
    U.S. leaves Afghaninam in disgrace and defeat. Many wonder why we ever went their
    and especially why we stayed so long. Many veterans claim \"the politicians lost
    that war, we were never beaten in battle!\" Not all is lost, war was a big boost
    for careerist miltary types, journalists and defense contractor profits. And many
    bloggers' careers.\r\nYeah, Kabul's gettin' to be a mighty rough town again. Wouldn't
    be at all surprised if Karzi becomes a martyr for Democracy soon..."

    here is    \"Kilcullen;s long war\"\r\n\r\n\"Kilcullen would like to believe that
    the \"accidental guerrilla\" syndrome can be avoided by a surgical counterinsurgency
    combined with Western liberal reform, as opposed to a ham-fisted, knock-down-the-doors
    combat approach. But he admits that imposing law and order American-style in Afghanistan
    is a \"temporary\" form of neocolonialism that will produce violent popular resistance.
    \r\n......The strategic dilemma is created when this neocolonialism fosters a
    corrupt regime of warlords, drug lords and landlords, as it has in Kabul. The
    first priority of Kilcullen's counterinsurgency doctrine is \"a political strategy
    that builds government effectiveness and legitimacy while marginalizing insurgents,
    winning over their sympathizers, and coopting local allies.\" Obama's recent surge
    in Afghanistan, whose purpose was to protect Afghanistan's presidential election
    process, had the opposite result: sending Americans to fight for an unpopular
    Kabul machine that committed fraud on a massive scale.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thenation.com/doc/20091102/hayden/2"

    have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the United
    States' presence in Afghanistan. I have doubts and reservations
    about our current strategy and planned future strategy, but my resignation is
    based not upon how we are pursuing this war, but why and to what end. To put simply:
    I fail to see the value or the worth in continued US casualties or expenditures
    of resources in support of the Afghan government in what is, truly, a 35-year
    old civil war.....\"\r\n\r\n\"....I have observed that the bulk of the insurgency
    fights not for the white banner of the Taliban, but rather against the presence
    of foreign soldiers and taxes imposed by an unrepresentative government in Kabul.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://original.antiwar.com/news/2009/10/27/resignation-letter-from-us-foreign-service-officer-matthew-p-hoh/"

  content: "Polls conducted in Afghanistan are not reliable or representative of the
    entire nation, nevertheless most Afghans tolerate the presence of the coalition
    forces and foreign NGOs because they believe that in the long run Afghans will
    inherit a secure nation with a functioning economy. \r\nIf we pull out now or
    in the near future, Afghanistan will revert to its old ways and the Pashtuns who
    fancy themselves as the legitimate heirs to the seat of power in Kabul will win
    out over the Northern Alliance or any other faction.\r\n The Pashtuns are the
    largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and they consider themselves the defenders
    of the nation;  history buffs know that it was the Pashtun tribes that fought
    the British and the Russians in the past and they are now fighting the latest
    Ferangis on their land. Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and Turkomans do not have the
    stomach or the zeal of the Pashtun tribes and therefore they will capitulate and
    raise the white flag a lot sooner than we think leaving the Pashtuns in charge
    once again."

<p>On October 1st, 1842 Lord Edward Law Ellenborough (1790-1871) issued a special proclamation from Simla, four years to the day after Lord Auckland had declared a war on Afghanistan.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Government of India directed its army to pass the Indus in order to expel from Affghanistan a chief believed to be hostile to British interest, and to replace upon his throne a Sovereign represented to be friendly to those interests, and popular with his former subjects. </p></blockquote>
<p>In 1838, Lord Auckland had decided that a regime change was needed in Kabul - Dost Muhammad was to be replaced by the friendlier Shah Shuja. The British had kept 10,000 or more troops in Kabul to secure the new ruler. However, the uprising of 1841 in Kabul resulted in the mass killing of British troops and their families ending the first Anglo-Afghan War in infamy. </p>
<p>Ellenborough's forces had gone to avenge that defeat. Ghazni, Jalalabad and Kabul were scorched to the ground. Having done that, Lord Ellenborough saw no reason for the British to continue to stay around what precious little was left to stay around <i>for</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Governor-general will leave it to the Affghans themselves to create a government amidst the anarchy which is the consequence of their crimes. </p></blockquote>
<p><i>The anarchy which is the consequence of their crimes</i>, indeed. It should be noted that he was installing the very tribes to power whose crimes he had come to avenge. Be that as it may, in his estimation, the mountains of northwest and the rivers of Punjab and Indus would be both a barrier to the "barbarous tribes of Affghanistan" and a "limit nature appears to have assigned to [British] empire". </p>
<p>But, only a few months later, in February 1843, Ellenborough endorsed the extension of the Company's natural empire over the princely state of Sindh - a crucial frontier region bordering Punjab, Afghanistan and Persia - based largely on the fears that the Mirs of Talpur were colluding with the Shah of Afghanistan against the British. This was followed by the Anglo-Sikh wars of 1845 and the annexation of Punjab. This left only the princely states of Kalat and Swat between the Afghanistan and the British.</p>
<p>Any and all resemblance to current events is pretty intentional.</p>
