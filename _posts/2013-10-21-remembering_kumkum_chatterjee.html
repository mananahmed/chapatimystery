<p>Two weeks ago, a group of scholars and family members gathered at Penn State University to honor the memory and work of <a href="http://history.psu.edu/news-and-events/kumkum-chatterjee-a-remembrance-by-mrinalini-sinha">Kumkum Chatterjee</a> (1958-2012). The conference, <a href="http://history.psu.edu/news-and-events/a-conference-in-memory-of-professor-kumkum-chatterjee">The Local as Cosmopolitan: Negotiating Tradition, Making History, Translating Culture in South Asia</a>, was hosted by Penn State's History and Asian Studies departments along with others. It focused on presentations and discussions of the themes which animated Kumkum Chatterjee's life-work: cultural and imperial entanglements, literary history, place and narrative. </p>
<p>On the academic front, the papers by Ramya Sreenivasen, Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Mrinalini Sinha and Madhuri Desai were a special treat for me. A number of speakers - Partha Chatterjee, Robert Travers - spoke of the historiographic impact of Kumkum's 1998 article, "History as Self-Representation: The Recasting of a Political Tradition in Late Eighteenth-Century Eastern India" <em>Modern Asian Studies</em> 32, which launched a number of re-assessments as well a critical interest in examining Mughal historiography on Bengal. </p>
<p>On the personal front, it brought tears to my eyes (of laughter) when after dinner, participants shared funny anecdotes and songs, evoking the laughter that I most associate with Kumkum. </p>
<p>We look forward to the publication of Kumkum's essays and the establishment of her library and archive in the future. </p>
