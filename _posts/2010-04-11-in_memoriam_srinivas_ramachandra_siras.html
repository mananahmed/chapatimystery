    was an innocent man who certainly did not deserve this.

  content: "\"A research scholar in the department of mass communication said, &ldquo;It
    is well known that the mastermind of the Siras sting operation is associated with
    the LIU [Local Intelliegence Unit]. Students who are part of LIU enjoy the support
    of the university higher-ups&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;right from the V-C to the Proctor.&rdquo;
      A research scholar in Siras's department of Modern
    Indian Languages, who too is an 'informer'
    for LIU, is also said to have played a crucial role in the sting operation. This
    student is said to have collected information about his &ldquo;activities&rdquo;
    and passed it on to the LIU.   Proctor Md Zubair Khan confirmed: &ldquo;There
    is such a proctorial team on the university. You can call it a local intelligence
    unit where students give information about campus activities and unwanted elements.
    There are watch and ward staff who are salaried employees. We also have students
    &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; proctoral monitors and deputy proctoral monitors &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    who act as campus monitors. The aim is to maintain law and order in the university.&rdquo;
    On the sting operation on Siras, Zubair said, &ldquo;The LIU team
    had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;   Tariqul Islam, a reader in
    the department of philosophy, said: &ldquo;There was some kind of
    surveillance of Siras's residence at the behest of the university.
    It is mentioned in the Proctor's report that he reached Siras's
    residence after being informed by LIU guards.&rdquo; &ldquo;At
    AMU, you have sleuths in plainclothes snooping around, spying on you all the time,&rdquo;
    he added. \"'  is this a university or an ISI subsidiary?   May
    Mr. Siras rest in peace."

    (whatever it is) make it easier to have this fascist sounding LIU thingy there?
    or do many (or some) other Indian Universities have similar \"intelligence units\"?
     The letters LIU are uncomfortably close to FIU (field intelligence unit) which
    is the intelligence arm of various military formations in both India and Pakistan
    (and in Pakistan at least, has a reputation for torture and intimidation in some
    cantonement areas).  Do the \"elite\" IITs have similar units in place? Or
    is the above story blowing it out of proportion somehow?"

    to say with certainty that the IITs do not have any equivalent of this - after
    all, even at the AMU it was an ad hoc sort of thing. However, given the general
    sensibility prevailing at the IITs it is hard to believe they have people whose
    sole job is to run around exposing incidence of gay behaviour.

  content: "I think what is wrong is exactly what is wrong with orthodox Islam in
    general. The version that became enshrined as \"standard Islam\" (at least in
    Sunni Islam) is clearly fascistic and includes built in mechanisms (blasphemy
    and apostasy laws for example) that prevent any criticism. This sets up a situation
    where certain views (views that MOST Muslims do not adhere to in practice) acquire
    automatic legitimacy (knocking on doors to wake up sleeping kids for fajr is OK,
    but knocking on doors to say this should stop is not, and so on..).  The point
    is not to say that some other fascist force should beat them up and change their
    minds. But it is necessary to raise enough of a fuss to get them to accept that
    while they have the right to any interpretation they like, they should get used
    to a world where others may have different ideas.  To cut down on unnecessary
    arguments, i will humbly request that responses should avoid the terms orientalism,
    metropole and Edward Said.  Discussions about why fascism is a western political
    term irrelevant to \"us\" are permitted but every such response must suggest an
    alternative pejorative term or will be ignored.  Just kidding intellectuals,
    just kidding. blast away with Edward sahib's guns or anyone you want.  Let a hundred
    flowers bloom. Cheers."

    built in mechanisms (blasphemy and apostasy laws for example) that prevent any
    criticism.&rdquo;  I don't think &ldquo;fascistic&rdquo;
    is a useful term in this context; used to describe any belief system or political
    arrangement that is bad/intolerant/repressive etc., &ldquo;fascistic&rdquo;
    loses all specificity.  Akbar's Mughal court, the Sun King's
    Versailles, Mussolini's Italy, Franco-led Spain, and the House
    of Saud all &ldquo;include[]d built in mechanisms &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    that prevent[ed] any criticism.&rdquo;  [Aside: given that the
    self-image of Islam, as reflected in the canonical texts, is such as to place
    certain questions beyond dispute (for instance, on the subject of the resurrection
    I remember a lecture given by Harold Bloom where he called the Quran the &ldquo;most
    convinced book on earth&rdquo;; he was being complimentary, inasmuch
    as the text's conviction was for Bloom itself a(n) (especially
    powerful) literary mode), perhaps the more interesting question is why this &ldquo;self-image&rdquo;
    has not only co-existed with, but engendered, such a heterodoxy of practice/belief/ritual?
    \ And, given these histories, to the extent one takes seriously the notion that
    the &ldquo;fascistic&rdquo; and modern political Islam
    are close enough to kiss, perhaps we need to look at other genealogies than the
    purely theological ones; mindful of the terms you have placed beyond the pale,
    I see that &ldquo;modernity&rdquo;, &ldquo;standardizing
    political projects&rdquo;, &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;colonialism&rdquo;, and others are nevertheless
    available.  AMU itself was founded by one of the original (since we are using
    anachronistic terms) brown sahibs&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;]"

  content: "I agree entirely. When i wrote the word \"fascist\", I knew I was going
    to get into trouble, so I covered myself appropriately. I joked about brother
    Edward because I meet a lot of highly educated types who seem to believe that
    Edward bahadur has proven for all times to come that evil was born in Europe and
    every non-European sin is the result of \"orientalism\" (OK, i exaggerate, but
    only slightly), so I wanted the brother out of the way before we go at it. I
    think heterodoxy and orthodoxy are BOTH present and it is not really a true paradox
    in the sense that there is no a priori reason why they cannot both exist in the
    \"same religion\". Orthodoxy may wish to believe that it is so great there is
    no room for heterodoxy, but people are people, they tend to wander and get ideas. I
    think ANY religion that claims to be a complete way of life, perfectly communicated
    in a perfect book, is going to have people who take those claims to their logical
    conclusion. But since there actually IS no such religion (i.e. perfect, complete,
    unchanging) therefore what will actually happen is that multiple individuals and
    groups will develop mutliple orthodoxies, all claiming to be perfect and complete.
    And good ideas are good ideas. Once somebody figures out that killing apostates
    is a good way of keeping defections down, then everyone from the Mafia to Salafist
    Islam is going to take up the idea. Same with blasphemy laws.  From the point
    of view of the ulama, they work very well. Western liberals claim they inhibit
    free thougth and intellectual development, but then, who cares what they think. and
    so on....got to run."

    system at AMU, and the concept of Halls of residence, Provost etc. are modeled
    after Oxford University(AMU had many British professors in 1920-30's, who were
    instrumental in establishing it's Physics dept and Humanities faculty), hence
    there is Proctor  Office.  Here are clippings from Oxford univ webpage,
    about Proctor Office. Part of the Proctors' role is to investigate possible
    breaches of University disciplinary codes and to bring charges against students
    accused of infringing these codes.  The Proctors can also take action in
    cases where students have been charged with or convicted of serious criminal offences,
    and where students are being banned from access to University premises or services. The
    Proctors' Office is the administrative base for three senior officers of the University
    who are elected annually by colleges.  The Senior Proctor and Junior Proctor
    make sure that the University operates according to its statutes. As well as being
    members of key decision-making committees, they deal with  university (as
    distinct from college) student discipline complaints about university matters the
    running of University examinations They also carry out ceremonial duties, e.g.
    at degree ceremonies.  The Proctors and Assessor are supported by two teams
    of staff. There is a secretariat, headed by the Clerk to the Proctors, and a body
    of full-time and part-time Proctors' Officers.  http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/proctors/discipline.shtml"

  content: "Since I am a graduate of AMU, I would like to clear some issues. Though
    it's name is Aligarh Muslim University, it doesn't discriminate on basis of religion,
    and in Medical and Engineering courses there may be more non-muslims in a particular
    batch, and in Arts faculty there may be more muslims. No one is forced to live
    or behave in any supposed \"islamic\" way.Though it has some matters of etiquette
    (tahzeeb) which one is expected to follow, for eg. you cannot go out of your Hall
    of residence in kurta pyjama  (you need to have a sherwani over it), you cannot
    go out in flip flops, an elected member of university student union cannot ride
    a bicycle  etc. In XI-XII standard there is course of Sunni theology, but there
    is also Shia theology, and for non muslims a course on Ancient Indian History. The
    syllabus of sunni theology doesn't recommend any specific text, rather individual
    topics like pre-islamic arabia,jang-e-badr, brief life sketch of prophet etc (
    a pet question in exams was,\"elaborate on lessons for muslims from battle of
    badr and battle of trench ). Though Tablighi jamaat is quite strong in campus,
    it has an equally strong leftist lobby  led by famous historian Irfan Habib, and
    the majority doesn't have any such affiliation.  In last 25-30 years no student
    with direct affiliation with tabligh or jamat-e-islami has won any student body
    election (some of them had been member in the past but resigned few years before
    election), though a student was elected president in 2002-03 who had links to
    AISA (the student wing of extreme leftist party CPI-ML)."

    AMU - I even studied in AMU affiliated school - Minto Circle. @Qalandar  Aligarian
    has already cleared many issues.  As I said there are so called prayer monitors
    but few take this seriously. There is no reservation for muslims at AMU .   It
    is not as if muslims are not studying in other institutions.    My parents
    sent me to study AMU so that I could live in a muslim environment where allowances
    are made for religious practise  Classes end early on Friday - so that I one could
    go home and have ghusl and then go for Jumah prayers , Periods shorter in Ramadan
    etc.Masjids at walking distances  etc.. Girls could wear Burqa and even Niqab
    in College although that very few girls do so is altogether different matter.  I
    could learn Urdu in school - I believe there are very few English medium schools
    in UP where urdu is taught. Baitbaazi - a sort of antakshari - where urdu shairs
    are used instead of film songs.  Who told you ladies are not allowed in
    library ? Undergraduate girl students study in the Womens College which has its
    own library. PG Students use the University library. The question was travel
    arrangements for girl students from the library to thier Halls of Residence in
    the evening and night.    God I miss AMU"

  content: "@ Qalander: there isn't much to understand in these etiquettes, these
    aren't any codified rules, but are generally referred to as \"traditions\". Yes,
    walking is preferred to riding a bicycle, though they can ride on a rickshaw or
    pillion on a scooter/motorcycle. Though down the ages many have challenged these
    traditions and many student union candidates have refused to wear a shervani etc. 
    \ My point was that there are no mullahs there forcing you to live your life according
    to their diktats. It has a very secular and multi cultural atmosphere.  In
    late 1980's the university Soccer team reached finals of National inter university
    finals (a rarity) and there was just one Indian national in whole team; the rest
    were from Iran, Syria, Jordan and Ethiopia . Similarly  AMU team defeated Benares
    Hindu Univ( a traditional rival,but there are annual competition between the 2
    in for communal harmony) in 1991, in Basket ball with help of two Somalian forwards
    who were both 7 feet plus. I did my XI-XII, MBBS and MD from AMU, and in my
    class there were about 45 girls (in class of 100) and hardly 2 used to wear a
    head scarve and many used to wear jeans etc . There was an Annual Sports and cultural
    meet where girls participated in singing, sports, literary and theater activities,
    and on some years we had national meet with teams from Delhi, Madras Lucknow Medical
    colleges etc participating and living with us on campus."

    of \"empire\" overlooked these days, or is it that you regard \"empire\" as a
    morally neutral phenomenon, and that the air of condemnation/critique has no place
    in histories of empire?"

  content: "Qalandar,  I was just joking. I do find the word \"empire\" thrown
    around rather more than seems justified (referring to a supposed American empire,
    but frequently used for entities that have a rather tenuous connection to any
    actually existing empire, and always left nameless so that the writer cannot be
    pinned down to specifics, leaving the door open for other interpretations, most
    of them equally mushy), but in this case, I was joking.  I think the British
    empire was many things, some good, some bad (by whatever standards we prefer to
    apply), some neutral, some that could not be justified in the good old days and
    cannot be justified today. It was, after all, an empire.  But as I said, I was
    just having fun with the regulars. I hope no one minds. My grandfather went
    to Aligarh and took advantage of the association in some trains, but seemed to
    move further and further away from North Indian Islamicate aristocratic notions
    of \"tehzeeb\" as he grew older. He had a very overdeveloped bullshit detector.
    My father joined the Pakistan military academy and came home smartly dreassed
    and with a copy of TIME magazine and was rather ostentatiously reading it in my
    Dada's very rustic home. Dada asked him what he was reading and he says he said
    with some pride \"TIME\". Dada skimmed through it, then noticed the price on the
    cover. He asked my dad \"did you actually pay for this?\". Abu somewhat indignantly
    replied \"of course, it costs 1 rupee\" (or whatever). At which dada reportedly
    laughed and said \"Really? you paid for it? I thought this was a freebie they
    hand out at the embassy\". He also couldnt figure out what people saw in that
    snob Mohammed Ali Jinnah."

    deaths are tragic -- but there is nothing about them that is AMU-specific, as,
    sadly, they are representative of a general reality of Indian life.  But the idea
    that a quasi-official or authorized plot should be used to humiliate and embarrass
    a faculty member, in order to police a vision of what the university should be,
    IS AMU-specific.  The latter tells us something about AMU; the former, something
    about India (and is presumably covered as such: the AMU-deaths might not have
    gotten much coverage, but murders by this or that mafia routinely get a lot of
    coverage in the Indian press).  I do not mean to sound cavalier, but am
    simply suggesting that not all criminality means the same."

    unusual case, and hence, more newsworthy.    And then there are other possible
    agendas as well: the self-image of the English language media as socially liberal
    and \"modern\" is engaged by this story in a very notable way; as is the fact
    that the villain of the piece is AMU -- enabling various media outlets to deflect
    right-wing claims that they have double standards when it comes to Hindu intolerance
    as opposed to Muslim intolerance, by vigorously criticizing AMU (\"freeing\" them,
    the paranoiacs might say, to further indulge the double standard) :-)...  But,
    quite frankly, the fact that no-one has pure motives is surely not any reason
    to avoid taking AMU to task -- especially as AMU does not appear to be sorry about
    the whole affair..."

  content: There's much I don't disagree with in your last response, but I think you
    are completely wrong to say that had this happened at BHU, it wouldn't have gotten
    coverage.  I think it certainly would have, for some of the reasons discussed
    earlier in this thread.  Especially because the organized gay-rights movement
    in India is disproportionately urban and relatively well-heeled and media savvy,
    they will certainly be ahead of the (media) curve as compared to the BHUs of the
    world.  And quite frankly, without the "Muslim" angle, we would likely have seen
    even MORE criticism from (at least the English-language) media  (in short, it's
    the "gay" angle, rather than the Muslim angle, that has made this a "hot" issue).  [The
    Hindi media, my sense is, has hardly taken AMU to task in the same way; because
    the support for gay rights in the audiences for those newspapers/channels is often
    not there, it is not an issue that IMO has as much salience for those audiences.]

<blockquote><p>LUCKNOW: An Aligarh Muslim University professor, on the verge of retirement, was suspended after some students set up cameras to catch him having consensual sex with a rickshaw-puller in his campus home, and sent the video film to university authorities. Dr Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras, reader and chairman of Modern Indian Languages at AMU, now says he won't challenge his suspension and would voluntarily leave. </p></blockquote>
<p>Apr 1, 2010. <a href="http://www.flonnet.com/stories/20100423270811700.htm">The great divide</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras has won the first round of the legal battle. On April 1, an Allahabad High Court Bench comprising Justices Sunil Ambawani and Kashi Nath Pandey stayed the suspension of the Aligarh Muslim University professor against whom disciplinary action had been taken following reports of his involvement in a homosexual relationship. Advocate Anand Grover who represented Siras said: &ldquo;The stay order demonstrates that an individual with a different sexual orientation cannot be treated in a fashion devoid of justice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apr 8, 2010. <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aligarh-gay-professor-found-dead-may-have-killed-self/articleshow/5771916.cms">Aligarh gay professor found dead, may have killed self</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>LUCKNOW: Less than two months after he was suspended and hounded out of his campus home on charges of having consensual homosexual act with a rickshaw-puller, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) teacher Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras was found dead in mysterious circumstances at his rented single-room accommodation in Quarti police circle of Aligarh. </p></blockquote>
<p>Apr 9, 2010. <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aligarh-gay-professor-found-dead-may-have-killed-self/articleshow/5771916.cms">Gay prof was known as a literary genius</a></p>
<blockquote><p>NAGPUR: "I am shocked and deeply hurt by his death. He was a good associate and was well-known in the literary circles. May his soul rest in peace,'' said Poet Grace. Like him there are hundreds of fans of Prof Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras in Nagpur deeply shaken by his sudden death. Grace recalled Siras, a resident of Coffee House Square in Dharampeth, as well-known in the literary circles for his poems. The deceased professor was in the city and had just returned to Aligarh on Monday. </p></blockquote>
<p>April 12, 2010. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=111616468861238&ref=nf">Justice for Dr. Siras</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We condemn the events leading to the persecution and eventual death of Dr. Srinivas Ramachandra Siras, Reader and Chair of Modern Indian Languages at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). His death is the result of the harassment he faced, including the unlawful and unethical suspension he faced on account of his being gay. Dr Siras had to undergo trauma, fear, harassment and humiliation in and by his own University and all actors involved must be held culpable in his death.</p></blockquote>
