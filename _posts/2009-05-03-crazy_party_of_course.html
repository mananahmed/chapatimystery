  content: "\" On a spring night in Lahore, I came face to face with all that is puzzling
    about Pakistan.'\r\nWhat atavistic urge causes people to write banalities like
    this when South Asia comes into the picture? That old riff on Asia, Land of Contrasts.
    \ Which a reporter can apparently capture perfectly after spending a couple of
    days there.  Ah well. \r\n\"So which is the real Pakistan? Collapsing state or
    crazy party?\" I'll choose C.\r\nAnd somewhere between the \"old man sputtering\"
    that the U.S. supports dictators in Pakistan and the \"old man sputtering\" that
    the U.S. supports dictators in Pakistan lies a story."

  content: "\"There is rural Pakistan, where two-thirds of the country lives in conditions
    that approximate the 13th century.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the sentence that irked me
    the most.  I can deal with the Fascinating Contradictions of The Mystical East.
    \ But what bugs me about lines like this -- which I also read regarding Afghanistan
    -- is that they take modern, present-day poverty and make it a living fossil drawn
    from the past.\r\n\r\nThe Pakistani military's land grabs, as well as long-standing
    issues of elites opposing land reform, both speak to me of modern society elites
    making collective decisions that enforce modern rural poverty.\r\n\r\nA more accurate
    and useful sentence would be:\r\n\r\n\"There is rural Pakistan, where two-thirds
    of the country lives in conditions that approximate 21st century poverty in developing
    nations across the planet.\""

  content: "Amidst all this happy backslapping about the ignorant western media, its
    easy to miss that the country they are talking about is actually in rather bad
    shape. I am willing to bet a Chinese dinner with anyone who thinks that they can
    visit Swat for vacation this year without getting permission from the holy warriors.
    Or who thinks the civil war in Pakistan is not about to get uncomfortably hot.
    The following are excerpts from two emails from a friend who is sympathetic to
    the islamists.....I trust his opinion much more than any professor whose last
    visit to the islamic emirate of Waziristan was in the days of the good old british
    empire (the context is easy to guess in both emails):\r\nThis \"survey\" is the
    biggest crock of S.... posted yet. (of course it is Farhat Taj and not you.) I
    was there on some business recently and I assure you this dude is not even close.
    Ignoring the \"statistics\" for a second, I even doubt the ability of the surveyors
    to conduct this \"research\" in Miranshah or Razmak. I even challenge Mr.Taj to
    just walk around the bazaar in Miranshah. This bazaar is bustling with Chechens,
    Uzbeks, Tajiks, Russians, Bosnians, some from EU countries and of course our Arab
    brothers. According to MY survey the foreign population is a little less than
    a third of the total . Any Waziri or Mehsud I spoke to seemed grateful to God
    for the priviledge of being able to host the \"Foreign Mujahideen\", Everyone,
    without exception, loathed the Drone attacks, as 90% casualties inflicted by them
    have been of civilians, mostly women and small children. \"Anti-American\" fellings
    are a little over a 100%. Regarding Pak Army's ability to carry out ANY incursion
    (most people laughed when I asked them this question) in this area, the question
    simply does not arise. The Pak Fauj has pulled back some 110 km from this area,
    near Bannu. While driving through this area I saw scores of abandoned check posts
    that were previously manned by the Army.They were full of pock marks from automatic
    fire and frequent car bombings. I witnessed a convoy of the Pak Fauj moving outside
    Bannu and you could see the terror in their eyes. They stopped all civilian traffic
    and had the drivers step out of the vehicles for fear of a car bomb attack. As
    they drove by they kept pointing their LMG's at the local populace till they had
    moved a good distance away.\r\nThe foreign fighters, I was told, come here for
    some R&amp;R while waiting to join the fight in nearby Afghanistan. Veg and fruits
    are cheaper than Lahore but flour is twice as expensive. Drones can be seen and
    heard almost constantly overhead and people have learned to live with it. These
    are a very Independent minded and fearless people and I cant imagine the Taliban
    or anyone else \"forcing\" themselves into their houses or hujras. Such a statement
    can only come from some soft idiot, totally oblivious to this culture and divorced
    from reality, writing from the safety of his air-conditioned office, far, far
    away.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I will have to disagree with Ms.Naqvi. Nobody views this
    struggle as \"Good vs Evil\",(except of course the Pentagon), least of all the
    soldiers themselves, who are being finagled into fighting their fellow country
    men to generate maximum U..S. aid. Desertions are a common and almost daily occurence.
    Many of the soldiers, at least in Waziristan, gave advance warning to villagers
    before attacking them, prior to the present cease fire. The ones that were \"sincere
    to duty\" didnt fare very well either. The entire 7 Baluch surrendered to less
    than a dozen people. There is a video of it. The Waziri's suggested a cease fire
    to the Army and asked them to retrieve their dead bodies after they had been left
    behind for more than a week under the open sky. I have seen videos of dogs feeding
    on them and some with maggots crawling out of their eye sockets. Yet the media
    shows this army as \"gung ho\" to \"wipe out\" extremism in the NWFP, the army
    that snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Kargil, who never took back one
    inch of Kashmir (ironically the \"Azad\" Kashmir we have now with us was also
    captured by the same tribesmen we are trying exterminate now and NOT the Pak Army),
    who were unable to save East Pakistan, who lost the Siachen Glacier. So dont believe
    the hype. It seems that all their \"valour\" is reserved for ill-equipped, bare-footed
    (some of them) Muslim opponents. These are the folks on whom 155mm Howitzers and
    tanks and F-16's and Gunships are used. This is an army of cowards and mercenaries,
    fighting to forward the agenda of their American masters. You know, its so sad,
    a few days ago when I heard on GEO news the Pak Fauj had captured Lal Qila, for
    a fraction of a second, I thought (or hoped) it was the Lal Qila of our ancestors
    in Delhi and not the location near Lower Dir, but immediately came to my senses.
    This Army will never fight India again. After shedding so much innocent Muslim
    blood all that is in store for them now, is humiliation. (Like they never had
    it before). They should take off that emblem on their uniforms which states their
    motto as,\" Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fi Sabeelillah\". It seems like a sick joke. So,
    no, I wont be tying any \"Yellow ribbons\" for these killers."

  content: "So let's examine the \"foreign\" element, in the Pakistani militant islamist
    movement, or whatever you want to call it. You have millions of pushtuns in NWFP,
    Waziristan, FATA as Pakistani citizens. It's not clear if they even care about
    being citizens of pakistan or what have you, im sure most are educated about the
    Durand Line.  Furthermore, you have millions more in Afghanistan coming and going
    through the porous border. And by the way, are pissed off at the americans...\r\n\r\nThen
    you have the uzbeks, who come from a country that is ruled by a vicious dictator.
    Islam Karimov has banned political parties and has killed numerous islamists.
    So now Pakistan is taking in these hard line islamist political actors, who can't
    go back to their country or risk getting killed...\r\n\r\nthen you got the arabs.
    From algeria to iraq, armed with Saudi money and hoping to fight and hopefully
    die in battle. They fought in afghanistan in the 80s and they'll fight in pakistan
    now. Real bad guys, nasty. No political motivation for their struggle, just faith
    in the afterlife. You can't appease these types. \r\n\r\nThen you got the bosnians.
    Instead of traveling a couple miles west and making a living in france or germany,
    they travel halfway across the world to fight in NWFP. What can you say?  \r\n\r\nDoesn't
    look good guys"

  content: "Akbar sahib, civilian deaths are civilian deaths. Whether killed by the
    Americans or the taliban or the glorious pakistani armed forces. It is indeed
    wrong for americans to go so far away to bomb wedding parties, but its still not
    OK for the taliban to blow up innocent school children (video available on youtube)
    as they march to school near a checkpoint on the road... or  for colonel TM to
    push Balochis out of the open door of an MI-8 helicopter.  Somehow, I do suspect
    a lot of it would go on irrespective of american presence there. I suspect that
    when the Chinese run the place, they too will bomb wedding parties, but its true
    that I cannot prove it yet. The holy warriors, for example, have already crossed
    borders many times to kill infidels in faraway places. And why cross borders at
    all? Modi did it in his own state. so did the taliban in Bamyan and Mazar e Sharif.
    in fact, we can go back in history and read about the tens of thousands killed
    in dozens of expeditions across so many borders. The Americans are only the latest
    empire to do the needful. Somehow, I dont think the empire of the holy warriors
    will be that much of an improvement (some people think they will kill less people
    because they are so primitively armed, but people with machetes killed half a
    million in Rwanda, I am sure the holy ones can make an impressive effort when
    they get their chance).\r\nOf course,  Allah SWT has given us the blessed chance
    to stay out of the way of such crude brutalities. for now.\r\nThe story about
    colonel TM is really true. Colonel sahib admitted to it after being accused of
    such \"harsh steps\" during a drinking session in Pakistan. Neither he, nor his
    drinking partners (I was too young to drink then) were too bothered by the unfortunate
    necessity of throwing people out of helicopters when you are doing counter-insurgency
    work. Its not work for the faint of heart."

    do not know where you get the impression that I am \"Taliban \"sympathizer or
    condoning any deaths as a result of \"Taliban \"actions.\r\nI was pointing to
    an obvious omission while counting foreigners in the AF-Pak muddle.\r\nAnother
    reason for my sarcasm may be that 'Civilized Nations\" are doing the same as \"Taliban\"
    does then what is the difference.Infact there were no Taliban in AF-PAK  before
    Russian invasion( as  Z.Brzezinski boasted , how America goaded Russia into invasion)
    and subsequent grand Jihad by caolition of \"People of BOOK' . So America and
    Pakistan Army is in killing/oppression business long before Taliban came on horizon.
    At least there should not be confusion about cause and effect .\r\n\r\n\"Somehow,
    I do suspect a lot of it would go on irrespective of american presence there.
    I suspect that when the Chinese run the place, they too will bomb wedding parties,

    local people do not understand cause and effect, are not well prepared and well
    informed, there would be many more invaders with their mouths watering at the
    prospect of conquest.( As Robert Novak said before Bush re-election \"Who is going
    to challenge GW BUSH, the conquerer of Iraq and Afghanistan?\")\r\n\r\n\"The holy
    warriors, for example, have already crossed borders many times to kill infidels
    in faraway places. And why cross borders at all?....\"\r\n\r\nNow by throwing
    in Modi , you can conflate the extremists of all religious persuations but if
    you look carefully the motives may be to get more political control rather than
    either exterminate or convert all who disagree. Also people who are willing to
    give their own life might have different motives than what we assign to them i.e;
    irrational hatred.\r\n\r\nTo begin with there are a  couple of good books by Robert
    Pape (University of Chicago) titled \r\n\"Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of
    Suicide Terrorism.\" \r\nand\r\n\"Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War
    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nI got better informed about American military and economical designs
    by reading the following\r\n\r\n1)  Blowback,  The Costs and Consequences of American
    Empire (American Empire Project) by Chalmers Johnson     \r\n2)The Sorrows of
    Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire

  content: Akbar sahib,  My apologies, I was arguing with imaginary people. I just

    at Bagram are caught on tape urging US soldiers to evangelize in the Muslim country.\"\r\n\"The
    fact that the video footage is being broadcast on Al Jazeera guarantees that it
    will be seen throughout the Muslim world. It is likely to add more credence to
    the perception that the US is engaging in a war on Islam with neo-crusader forces
    invading Muslim lands.\"\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeremy-scahill/us-soldiers-in-afghanista_b_195639.html"

<p>I actually have a post on the cinemas of Pakistan, including the <i>Capital</i> hall and the insane cultural war they represent. (No, it's not what you'd think). In any case, Sabrina Tavernise in the NYT on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/weekinreview/03tavernise.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">contradictions</a> of Pakistan.</p>
