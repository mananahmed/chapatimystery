  content: oh i saw an amazing display of kalaripayattu on the way from bangalore
    to mysore. it was some sort festival near tipu sultan's summer palace. very cool.
    some years later, in the anuradhapura, sri lanka- i went to a museum where we
    saw small carvings of the chola kings practicing the martial art. these weren't
    too laudatory, as the sinhala hated the invading cholas.

  content: Have you been doing any reading on "Varma Kalai" ? It's the Kalari Payattu
    equivalent of the Vulcan nerve pinch. There are purpotedly masters of Kalari who
    can disable, even kill with precise hits to nerve centers, sometimes even from
    a few feet away without making any physical contact.

    Wow, pretty fascinating.

    Why is it not more recognized (I've read tons of martial arts books, and never heard of it)?

    It looks like good exercise, but I'm not sure about the practical fighting applications.  There are really only two fighting styles that consistantly win inter-art competitions: Thai kickboxing (muy thai) and Japanese judo (or variations of it, such as ju-jitsu).  All others, like karate, kung fu, etc. get taken down very quickly.

    Also--Vulcan death grips, or anything similar, just don't exist.  There are no disabling nerve centers.  You can hit someone hard enough to knock them out, or you can strangle/choke them.  Hurting people is not that easy.

    Great videos!

  content: I don't know where you and Philip Zarilli get these ideas. Essentially,
    this is another Western twist to the Eastern history. The mother of many martials
    arts, including Kalari, is a mixture Tamilian martial arts, starting from Varma
    Kalai, Silambam, Adithoda, Kuthuvarisai, Malyuttham etc. Almost all martial arts
    you see today, Kalari, Gong-fu, Muay Thai, Kali etc. are either an offshoot or
    local art heavily influenced by Tamilian martial arts. Cheras, Cholas were enemies
    but there were times of peace and alliances when all these martial arts were taught
    across borders. In all these forms, Kalari and Gong-Fu (what you know as Kung
    Fu) are the direct descendents of Tamilian martial arts. Gong Fu was created by
    Shaolin monks based on the martial arts taught by Bodhi Dharma, the founder of
    Zen and a Tamilian prince.  Kalari is just a last surviving bit of Tamilian martial
    arts. Most of these martial arts declined because they were either outlawed, hidden
    and the knowledge held back, which only makes sense because in the wrong hands,
    this is a dangerous weapon. Imagine the intimate knowledge of human body! This
    was developed by Siddhas or Tamilian Alchemists/Medicos. In fact, the founder
    of the great Siddha Lineage, Saint Agasthya is the founder of all these martial
    arts. The intimate knowledge of human body is a speciality of Siddhas and the
    medical art became a martial art, thus giving us the various martial arts as we
    know it.

    one or two days. And the masters will teach you the nerve related techniques only

  content: "Hi Friends, \r\nlike this artical said kalari is not only from kerala,
    its formed in tamilnadu in ancient times. Southern kerala is known as cheranadu
    in ancient times.,ex, manimegalai, sivaga sinthamani,kalingathu parani. cheranadu
    adopted by kochi kings in the time of 13th  century.When cholas and pandyas were
    weak. In kerala they called therkan kalari and vadakkan kalari,most of them feel
    ther kankalari is froud.Because its pidivarisai likes to varmas, they cant move
    and feel pain. vadakkan kalari thought by weapons and normal attacking technique
    only.Second there is very very rare people know about varma in kerala and Tamil
    nadu.Dont wast your time to learn varma. Even some people knows they will teach
    them blood lines only. You  can learn kutthu varisai  in trichy,thanjore, madurai
    and nagarcoil areas, there are very good old masters who thought you well, but
    you have to spend time atleast 3 years to become master to this art. Again kalari
    is not found or produced by kerala its the Tamilians martial art for the world.
    Thank you all."

  content: "I had been teaching Kalaripayat, stick, weapon training and Marma sastra
    (varma kalai). As my friend prassan has commented above, he should know that before
    India got its freedom, kerala and tamilnadu were one geographically and later
    it was divided in to two. So there is no need fighting over the point whether
    Kalari is the Mother martial art or silamam or varma adi or Adithada. To me all
    this are one and the same and one should not claim it is there's alone. So if
    \ Siddha Agasthya is Tamilian, what about sushruta, vagbhata and charaka. I hope
    they are not tamilians. They too have written plenty on marma sastra in sanskrit
    language. So lets take all the goodness as being culturally and traditionally
    as one and be proud we are Indian. \r\nI have taught marma sastra in Srilanka
    and taken classes in Bahrain, done demos and treatments in Qatar. Those interested
    in learning weapons, Marmam(Varmam) can contact in my email. check my website
    too. A skillful Marma artist must be knowledeful in  Marma chikitsa (the herbal
    remedy or treatments for the 108 points. Interested students can contact me. If
    you need to open branches else where, you need to arrange the space for teaching
    and provide food, accomodation and fees.\r\nBest of luck to all Martial art lovers.\r\nMathew

<p><img src="/images/kalarippayattu.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Thing about being a South Asian historian is that I am so clueless about South Asia. Like about <a href="http://www.kalaripayattu.org/">Kalarippayattu</a>. Did I even have an inkling about this mother of Kung Fu? How could I have not known about this bucket-of-oily-goodness South Indian Martial Art? I knew about <a href="/archives/homistan/art_of_pehlwani.html">pehlwani</a> and <a href="http://www.silambam.com/">silambam</a> but nothing about this? How uncooool.</p>
<p>An accidental discovery of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195655389/qid=1109886599/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-1509800-3505439?v=glance&s=books">book</a> at Powell's has opened my eyes. I have been obssessed with the <a href="http://www.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/video.html">video clips</a> -especially, <a href="http://www.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/kalari4.html">that</a> one. I want Spike Jonze to direct the <i>Drunken Guru</i> starring the Tony Jaa of Tamil Nadu.  </p>
<p><i>Kalarippayattu</i> literally means 'place' where 'exercises' are practiced. As a form of physical and martial training, it has been prevalent in Kerala since at least the 12th century. Zarrilli tells us that Brahmans of Kerala in the eleventh century had had enough of Chola aggression and took up arms to fight against them. Or conversely, it developed in the sudra caste of indigenous Nayars during the same time period. The Nayar caste provided retainers, soldiers, and administrators for the Nambudiri brahmins, and were the largest group with rights to bear arms. They could also do some mean triple lutzes in the air before hitting you with the sword. When the Portugese reached south India, they were surprised to see the Nayars walking around with open swords and giving them mean looks.  </p>
<p>It was the 1920s and that pesky colonialism that really invented Kalarippayattu. Kottakkal Karnaran Gurukkal [1850-35] and, his student, C.V. Narayanan Nayar [1905-44] created a showcase of the techniques for public performance highlighting the heroic past of Kerala and its many heroes. Kalarippayattu connected with the native audiences with its evocations of "ancient" techniques and incorporation of the mythology of the <i>Mahabharata</i>. From there, it morphed into the 5,000 year old fighting technique and became the mother of all martial arts etc. Funny thing, that colonialism. </p>
