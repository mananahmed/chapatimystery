  content: Far from trying to move beyond "tribalization", the governments of the
    region (i.e. even outside Afghanistan) are trying to replicate this model, in
    Pakistan's NWFP, and in India's Chattisgarh.  In both countries the notion that
    counter-insurgency can be usefully "outsourced" has gained ground.  The bloody
    results in Chattisgarh have perhaps dulled enthusiasm for extending this "model"
    to other states, but it is a scandal that it is being perpetuated in so many places...

  content: I  argue that the militias are less 'tribal' and more group of men from
    same ethnic group. There is a difference. Tribes have a hierarchy, set of customs
    and order. For example, one can speak to a tribal elder and can be assured that
    the rest of the tribe will usually follow. I believe that the civil war has effectively
    broken down the tribes and what we have now are ethnic-based militias. This means
    that the U.S. and her allies are re-arming groups of people that are less likely
    to promote political stability. This is more like re-arming the mafia, then actually
    re-arming tribes (also, they were never dis-armed in the first place).

  content: "Q - I dunno, the salwa judum strategy did a pretty good job of cleaving
    the adivasi support base of the Naxalites in Chattisgarh and stopped its expansion.
    Of course it was bloody but since most of those being killed were adivasis, peasants
    or low ranking policemen this would hardly be deemed a high cost by the Indian
    state.  This strategy was used to great effect to suppress quasi-ethno-nationalist
    type revolts by the British during the Mau Mau; where the turning point is accepted
    to be the arming and creation of the Home Guard, that split Kikiyu society into
    opposing factions."

  content: I don't deny the "efficacy", my point was that the bloody nature has dulled
    enthusiasm for extending the model to other states -- so far we haven't seen it
    outside Chattisgarh, and I have no doubt that those who thought this was a great
    idea in the first place would likely not have thought of it as  chattisgarh-only
    "solution".  i.e., even granting that the state machinery deems certain sorts
    of costs more acceptable than others, that does not preclude the notion that the
    associated political costs can nevertheless rise to a high enough level as to
    make wider extension of the course of action more difficult...

    my point was that the bloody nature has dulled enthusiasm for extending the model

    it outside Chattisgarh</i>  Where would it be applicable though, outside
    Chattisgarh? There aren't isolated, concentrated adivasi communities in any other
    state that are the basis for Naxalite activity on this scale - the only exception
    I can think of is Jharkhand and their the advasis are split along different political
    lines and the number of dikus is much higher and more settled than in Chattisgarh.
    Orissa is another partial exception, at least the interior belt is, but there
    isn't the same level of Naxalite activity here. Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are
    possible cases but I think the adivasi community is more integrated in those states
    and the Naxalites depend a lot more on landless labourers and the struggle over
    land as well as caste than they do on ethnic identity.  This solution only
    works when applied to an insurgency that has its social base amongst an adivasi
    population; other methods will be used for different situations."

  content: "Apart from the examples you mentioned, it could also be applied in parts
    of Maharashtra -- not exactly in its Chattisgarh contours, but remember that something
    not very unlike this was used in the late 1990s in Kashmir too (they called it
    village defense committees or some such thing), and is being used in a very different
    social context (i.e. a very different \"tribal\" ethos) in Pakistan's NWFP as
    well.  So the fact that the shoe doesn't fit precisely wouldn't dissuade the state
    machinery if it was otherwise convinced.  My reading is that had some of the states
    you mention been enthusiastic about the Salwa Judum approach, some variant of
    it would have been applied (at the time the approach was launched, it was not
    sold as a Chattisgarh-only approach IMO); but that the massive internal displacement
    in Chattisgarh and other forms of violence have dulled enthusiasm for it.  At
    least partly for this reason, the new \"approach\" seems to be to federalize the
    whole thing (using the usual excuses, such as that the states aren't well-equipped
    to tackle the security issues, etc. etc.  One can't forget that four of the six
    relevant states aren't Congress-ruled, and somehow state-level powerlessness wasn't
    used much as an excuse when it was a Congress government in Andhra that was doing
    the armed counter-insurgency).  Anyways, we're straying off the main point:
    i.e., even if you disagree with my interpretation, you seem to be disagreeing
    in the direction of my original point -- that experience with this sort of thing
    elsewhere in the sub-continent shows that this is not a good idea.  And, given
    (among others) the already highly militarized Pashtun zone between Pakistan and
    Afghanistan, and a highly fluid and chaotic situation, I can't think of a worse
    area for one to implement this sort of policy in.  i.e., I don't think it will
    do \"a pretty good job of cleaving the ... support base\" in the NWFP: on the
    Pakistani side, that support base is already somewhat cleaved as between insurgents
    and the very large number of Pashtuns in the Pakistani army itself; that hasn't
    stopped or slowed the entrenchment of the insurgency, and adding an extra layer
    wouldn't help.  Stated differently, for the reasons fpfj notes above, the NWFP
    is a LESS \"traditional\" society today (because of what has happened over the
    last three decades -- with the exception of the Great Lakes region, where else
    has the social fabric been rent so badly and for so long as here?) than even the
    likes of the \"tribal\" societies of Chattisgarh etc..."

  content: Good points Q, I think the difference is though here that the implementation
    of such a strategy would destroy the social unity and bonds of the political community
    where it would be implemented - imo, this was a desirable aim of state strategy
    in India because autonomous political adivasi communities are hugely marginalised
    from the mainstream and are often viewed as threats that need to be neutralised
    or destroyed at little political cost to the rest of lowland society. The ethnic
    otherness and cultural separation of many adivasi communities makes this a viable
    strategy in India. For the NWFP, it isn't because tribal society there is much
    more cohesive and stronger, has a longer tradition of armed resistance and because
    of the common factor of Islam they can count on political support and mobilisation
    from other parts of Pakistani society as well as on a shared religious tradition.
    Adivasi appeals on this basis, as seen in the most recent mining case involving
    Vedanta, just fall on deaf ears.

<blockquote><p>
Similarly, while the Afghan government appeared keen to disarm the predo- minantly non-Pushtun armed groups in the north, northeast and west of the country, it actually distributed more arms to the mainly Pushtun eastern and southern provinces in an effort to institute what it calls &ldquo;Afghanistan National Auxiliary Police&rdquo; (ANAP). Rearmament of militias in these regions was carried out even when there were genuine concerns that the Taliban and drug lords were benefiting from it.<br />
...<br />
Whatever the Afghan government's justification for the institution of the ANAP, the reality is that such tribal militias were also formed by previous Afghan governments including the	last Afghan monarchy (1930s — 60s), Daoud's Republic (1973—78), and the communist regime (1978—92). Past experience does not generate much optimism about their effectiveness as agents of stability. Pushtun tribal militias (Lashkars) were used by King Mohammad Nadir Shah in the early 1930s to suppress the non-Pushtuns in northern Afghanistan, thereby leaving a long trail of interethnic tensions that continue to haunt the col- lective memory of the northern communities to this day. Tribal Lashkars were also used by Daoud to destabilize Pakistan, the legacy of which poisoned the two countries' relations. Similarly the communist regime used the Uzbek (Dostum) and Pushtun (Esmat Muslim and Jabar Qahraman) ethnic militias to suppress its opponents in various parts of Afghanistan during the 1980s. The institution of tribal militias under the euphemism ANAP has been criticized not only because it undermines the reconstruction of legitimate security institutions, but also because it leads to more interethnic tensions in the country. Certainly it has not been helpful in creating trust in the government, which is a necessary requisite for successful transition to political stability in all post-conflict countries.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>The process of rebuilding the Afghan state has wrongly presumed that a strong unitary state was the most likely guarantee of political stability in the future. Such a view was based on the fear of the regional power-holders outside the direct authority of the government in the wake of the Taliban regime's collapse. However, by constraining the constitutional avenues for pol- itical participation of popular political actors at the regional level, the Afghan state has an inbuilt potential for political instability. It has to maintain expensive security forces in order to contain the regional power-holders, who may other- wise resort to unconstitutional, and therefore destabilizing, ways of translating their local popularity into political power. Even if the state were to succeed in maintaining the required level of security apparatus, containing the regional power-holders will involve the use of force, or a constant threat of the use of force, by it. A political system that relies mainly on its coercive capacity to exact compliance from its citizens is not a stable political system.</p>
<p>An analysis of the situation in Afghanistan since the collapse of the Taliban regime cannot ignore the evident failure of the ethno-nationalist expatriate lea- dership which, as a bloc, had been generally perceived to be the main vehicle of political stability. Although the expatriate leadership is by no means united on all issues, its reliance on the military, political and economic support of the West as the principal means of preserving political power distinguishes it from the indigenous leadership. While they have effectively reduced the power of the indigenous leadership, their eagerness to manipulate international goodwill in support of internal political rivalries has contributed to instability in the country. The Afghan government deliberately underestimated the threat of the Taliban, causing a good amount of international focus to be reoriented to a relatively smaller challenge posed by the influence of regional power-holders. This allowed the Taliban to make a strong comeback and pose a more serious challenge to the stability of the new Afghan political system as a whole.</p></blockquote>
