  content: "I'm a little dense.  What is the implicit commentary?  Are you being funny
    or serious?  \n\n\n\nAre you suggesting that \"freedom\" is somewhere in between,
    at one end or another, elsewhere?  \n\n\n\nI'm guessing this is meant to be ironic
    in some way, but I don't quite follow.  (I live in L.A., after all.)  Thanks"

  content: "fair enough. i hope that one day, i can read a mind-numbingly moronic
    piece about the freedoms enjoyed by designers in baghdad and the demands of conspicuous
    consumption on the nightlife of shi'a and sunni party-goers. \n\n\n\nthere was
    no irony intended. and i was serious as death."

<p>Freedom is the distance from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/fashion/23PARTY.html?ex=1321938000&en=a416f5011af40b62&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">here</a> to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/world/middleeast/24iraqcnd.html?ex=1321938000&en=50df8a3849c15464&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">here</a>.</p>
<p>ps. Yes the first sentence is grotesque.</p>
