<p>And that explains, conclusively, Al-Qaeda in Iraq.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nba.com/blog/gilbert_arenas.html#070801_01">Gilbert Arenas</a>, of the Washington Wizards:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>There Are No Such Thing as Shark Attacks</b><br />
I know this is random, but I just want to clear this up for people out there.<br />
There are these things called shark attacks, but there is no such thing as a shark attack. I have never seen a real shark attack.</p>
<p>I know you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re making a weird face as you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re reading this. OK people, a shark attack is not what we see on TV and what people portray it as.</p>
<p>We&acirc;&euro;&trade;re humans. We live on land.</p>
<p>Sharks live in water.</p>
<p>So if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re swimming in the water and a shark bites you, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s called trespassing. That is called trespassing. That is not a shark attack.</p>
<p>A shark attack is if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re chilling at home, sitting on your couch, and a shark comes in and bites you; now that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a shark attack. Now, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re chilling in the water, that is called invasion of space. So I have never heard of a shark attack.</p>
<p>When I see on the news where it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;There have been 10 shark attacks,&acirc;&euro; I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m like, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hey, for real?! They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re just running around? Sharks are walking now, huh! We live on the land, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t live underwater.&acirc;&euro;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to Moacir for the link and the connection.</p>
