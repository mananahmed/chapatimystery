<p>And that explains, conclusively, Al-Qaeda in Iraq.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/gilbert_arenas.html#070801_01">Gilbert Arenas</a>, of the Washington Wizards:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>There Are No Such Thing as Shark Attacks</b><br />
I know this is random, but I just want to clear this up for people out there.<br />
There are these things called shark attacks, but there is no such thing as a shark attack. I have never seen a real shark attack.</p>
<p>I know you're making a weird face as you're reading this. OK people, a shark attack is not what we see on TV and what people portray it as.</p>
<p>We're humans. We live on land.</p>
<p>Sharks live in water.</p>
<p>So if you're swimming in the water and a shark bites you, that's called trespassing. That is called trespassing. That is not a shark attack.</p>
<p>A shark attack is if you're chilling at home, sitting on your couch, and a shark comes in and bites you; now that's a shark attack. Now, if you're chilling in the water, that is called invasion of space. So I have never heard of a shark attack.</p>
<p>When I see on the news where it's like, &ldquo;There have been 10 shark attacks,&rdquo; I'm like, &ldquo;Hey, for real?! They're just running around? Sharks are walking now, huh! We live on the land, we don't live underwater.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to Moacir for the link and the connection.</p>
