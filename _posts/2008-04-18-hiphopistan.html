    I can't decide if I like the Himalayan Project version better. They are both very
    haunting and beautiful. In my South Asia history class we are reading Rohinton
    Mistry's \"A Fine Balance\". This song is almost a perfect soundtrack for the
    section I am reading right now about the slum community. I am definitely going
    to share this with my fellow classmates.\r\n\"...Even a rose grows through cracks
    in concrete\r\nand a lotus floats hope in a stream of the ganges...\""

<p>The rhymes were flowing and beat was strong. And I had a big, huge, grin through the whole night. It was the first night of <a href="http://hiphopistan.uchicago.edu">Hiphopistan</a>. I skipped the panel - as each panel skipped, adds 10 weeks to my life span - and showed up in the middle of Kabir's set. I got to meet Yogi B and Natchatra - what great, genuine, and nice guys. Che Malabar was superb - and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emi3wfp4dq8">Postcards from Paradise</a> was the highlight for me. Things were political, things were tight. At one point, the taste at the back of my mouth and the incessant beat in my left ear, and I was transported to another place, long ago, in East L.A. when I went to my first hiphop concert. Ice Cube, who began the set with Assalamalaikum, mfers. Respect. Tonight, I will take pictures, and update this post. I am just happy. Long Live Desi Hiphop!</p>
<p><b>update:</b> We will talk soon about this. Until then, enjoy the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72157604624805237/">pictures</a> and, below the fold, a couple of videos in crappy youtube (I will put up nicer streaming verisons on the hiphopistan website):<br />
