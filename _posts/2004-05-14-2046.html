    i loved this movie - it was absolutely brilliant. if i ever get around to making a movie, i know i want it to be driven by colors, mood, and music rather than dialogue, like this movie.

    and on the link about not marrying muslim men, i'd say i have to agree. BIG MISTAKE; bad idea.

  content: if you have the Criterion Collection's DVD, there is a short story in the
    booklet on which the movie is based. Thats all the plot/story you would want...but
    there is no need for words in ITMFL.

<p><a href="http://www.festival-cannes.fr/films/fiche_film.php?langue=6002&id_film=4202747"><img src="/images/tony.jpg" border=0 align=left hspace=6></a> If there is god of film-making (dionysus?), he has blessed <a href="http://www.wongkarwai.net/">Wong Kar Wai</a> with powers beyond any human. There is no other director (ok, Kurosawa and Kubrick) whose every single movie is amazing to behold.<br />
<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/usa/in_the_mood_for_love.html">In the Mood for Love</a> remains the most visually stunning paean to lost love. A movie built around silences and blank canvases that leaves me stunned every time I watch it. Maggie Cheung, of course, takes my breath away dressed in the high-collor, bright palette dresses of 60s Shanghai. Tony Leung is an amazing actor who conveys in one look (on a deleted scene, no less) the deepest turmoil of a lover saying goodbye forever.<br />
ITMFL was shot while WKW was shooting 2046. That tells you how long of a gestation 2046 has had, since ITMFL was released in 2001. It continues, in an elliptical way, the character played by Tony Leung in ITMFL - except the movie takes place not in 60s Hong Kong but in the future of 2046. Zhang Ziyi plays a robot. I know it sounds weird but,..., it is Wong Kar Wai. The cinematography will be amazing - Christopher Doyle is the DP. It will be good. At long last, it is premiering at Cannes this weekend. To revisit those characters again will be amazing and I cannot wait until whenever it gets released here. Here is the first <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/cannes2004/story/0,14498,1221756,00.html">review</a> from the Guardian.<br />
