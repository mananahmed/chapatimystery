    Law. More bombings. And the eventual drain of all that capital that had accumulated
    in the country in the past 8 years. Zimbabwe, here we come. Unless, US and China
    can come to their senses and do some actual diplomacy. The status is bleak. Let
    us say that Musharraf resigns and leaves. The Supreme Court declares an election
    date, the new government solves the Baluchistan issue, th US redeploys significant
    troops to Afghanistan (and keeps them there), the Pakistani military combats within
    cities and mountains of Pakistan. War. Chaos. Uncertainty. And this, my gentle
    readers, would be the best case scenario. A more likely option is a military state
    somewhere between Mugabe's Zimbabwe circa 2005 and Gandhi's
    India circa 1976. I must be proven wrong. [...]"

  content: Dark hours have just gotten darker. For a brief time justice seemed to
    prevail for some miserable souls of Pakistan and rekindled hope in many others
    but the dark lord could not have let this happen. To be honest I didn;t have high
    hopes from the lawyer's movement or all this talk about free and fair elections.
    There is far too much wrong here that can be fixed by a few black coats and robes.
    I have been a Pakistani long enough to know that there is no silver lining, at
    least not in the foreseeable future. I don't  mean to sound too cynical but "to
    have seen what I have seen, see what I see!".

    the same old thing is happening in Pakistan with regards to Bhutto and Musharraf's
    shenigans, suicide bombings, massive numbers of people killed in the NWFP, Balochistan,
    Swat? It's like how inured we've become to the daily violence in Iraq. And am
    I the only one who whenever she sees pictures of either BB or Musharraf, an incredible
    urge overcomes me to smack their faces?   One thing for sure is that Musharraf,
    in full exposure of the world, is showing shamelessly desperate he is to implement
    any measure at his disposal to stay in power. And that the US keeps aiding him
    reminds me of how a flailing tinpot dictatator is supported no matter what large
    amounts of people think to the contrary (you can think up of examples here...)"

    is even bigger than you suggest.  Before the troops came in and put the Court
    on ice, a seven-justice bench managed to convene and issue an order <a href=\"http://thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=31604\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">invalidating the emergency declaration and PCO and enjoining
    anyone from acting under their supposed authority</a>.  (Talk about quick thinking
    under pressure.)  So I think it's more appropriate to say that there is no \"new\"
    Chief Justice -- Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry remains Chief Justice of Pakistan,
    and all of these pretenders who purport to act under the authority of the PCO
    and emergency declaration, and who have sworn oaths to it, are violating the Court's
    order on pain of contempt or worse.  And may be acting mala fides, even. ;)"

  content: "The straightforward answer to the above question is: to set the score
    straight with the Judiciary. The declaration of Emergency, as has been made clear
    by the text of the proclamation, which also shows that General Musharraf is first
    and foremost the Chief of Army Staff, and his speech, is in reality a declaration
    of war against the Judiciary and the Constitution of Pakistan. This time around,
    the General has decided to play the game in a clear-cut way rather than engaging
    in any complex legal deliberations.  The proclamation of Emergency-cum-Marshall
    Law leaves no doubt about its key target: &ldquo;some members of
    the judiciary&rdquo; who are working at the &ldquo;cross
    purpose with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism and
    extremism&rdquo;!!! Although the General has completely flushed the
    constitutional theory down the drain, he has also expressed his misconceived perception
    that he is only hope left of the people of Pakistan against rampant terrorism
    and extremism. What rubbish! He is the one who should be carrying the burden of
    blame for the mounting religious militancy; for he towed the Imperialist line
    in the 'war in terror', not the members
    of Judiciary. If the members of the Judiciary were offsetting the role of the
    notorious intelligence agencies and calling for transparency in the system in
    the favor of fundamental constitutional rights, what was so preposterous about
    that - except for the fact that the higher-ups in these agencies find any interference
    from the 'non-intelligent' civilians extremely
    distasteful?"

    it&#8217;s surprising how familiar it all sounds. The level of outrage with what
    is happening in India has diminished along the way. [...]"
---
<p>The wag will say that the nation has never left the state of emergency, but that is just being silly. </p>
<p>We now have a legal <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7076670.stm">State of Emergency</a> in Pakistan. Actually, it is officially being called "Emergency Plus" - more than "Emergency" but less than "Martial Law". Just right.</p>
<p>The move is hardly surprising considering the chaos engulfing Pakistan at the moment - from political (Supreme Court deliberations on the fate of the "election") to military (the tribal/militant conflict has spread to Swat and Peshawar) to ideological (Baluchistan) to international (Rice has decided she wants democracy).</p>
<p>According to the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) <a href="http://daily.urdupoint.com/todayNewsLive.php?news_id=48149&featured=1&cat_id=2">declaring emergency</a>, the steps were taken because of the recent terrorist attacks, the release of terror-suspects by the judiciary, the lack of oversight of the judiciary and the low morale of police and army in the nation. See the text <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/11/03/img/proclamation.pdf">here</a> [pdf].</p>
<p>The emergency law, <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part10.html">Article 232</a> of the Constitution: (summarized) The Proclamation of emergency is issued by the President if he deems that the country is threatened by internal or external violence or disturbance. The Federals can take over the Provinces, the High Court. It has to be affirmed by joint Assemblies within two months or it will automatically end. All the supreme courts in the country will have to re-take their oaths to the state and they will be barred from issuing any orders against the army or the state. </p>
<p>Musharraf has suspended the tv broadcasts - and prohibited any "print or electronic media discussion or analysis that hurts the national interests".</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, which was expected to rule on Musharraf in a few days, is currently boarded up. Cities like Sarghoda, Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad have mobilized <a href="http://express.com.pk/epaper/PoPupwindow.aspx?newsID=1100291767&Issue=NP_LHE&Date=20071103">against suicide attacks</a>. </p>
<p>Emergency Rule, maybe Martial Law, the replacement of Klashnikovs with Suicide Belts, the Vanished ... Pakistan needed our help a year ago. It needed a genuine push for democratic processes back in March. We left unchecked, and unhindered, a megalomaniac<br />
"enlightened moderator". We keep insisting on our own interests ahead of the interests of the people of Pakistan. We remain steadfast in our belief that those people are not as developed nor as functional as we would like them to be. Pakistan needs a strong dictator. The fallacy ... the gross oversight ... has always been that he was never in control. He did not control Baluchistan where a genuine call for accountability and justice was quashed by horrific military violence - including missile assassinations. Baluchistan should have been afforded our attention in 2005 - but we were too busy in Iraq. It became, contiguous with Waziristan, the outpost and then the center of Taliban/extremist insurgents over the next two years. We insisted on supporting the one person who had no legitimate power to negotiate or fight for over 40% of territorial Pakistan. Can you imagine that?</p>
<p>Next up? Martial Law. More bombings. And the eventual drain of all that capital that had accumulated in the country in the past 8 years. Zimbabwe, here we come. Unless, US and China can come to their senses and do some actual diplomacy. The status is bleak. Let us say that Musharraf resigns and leaves. The Supreme Court declares an election date, the new government solves the Baluchistan issue, the US redeploys significant troops to Afghanistan (and keeps them there), the Pakistani military combats within cities and mountains of Pakistan. War. Chaos. Uncertainty. And this, my gentle readers, would be the best case scenario. A more likely option is a military state somewhere between Mugabe's Zimbabwe circa 2005 and Gandhi's India circa 1976. I must be proven wrong. </p>
<p>For now, we have a new <a href="http://www.topnews.in/hameed-dogar-sworn-new-pakistan-chief-justice-25145">Chief Justice</a> of Pakistan Supreme Court. But in an unprecedented move, only 4 judges have signed on to re-take the oath under PCO. This is big, big news. See <a href="/archives/homistan/lawless_in_pakistan.html">this backgrounder</a> for the significance. </p>
<p>Musharraf is to speak on &ldquo;Meray Azeez Hum Watano&rdquo; at 11:00 PST. Please see Aitzaz Ahsan - under arrest - being interviewed while in a toilet on <a href="http://pkpolitics.com/2007/11/03/emergency-update-oneworld-update-4/">the constitutional crisis</a> by the Pakistani equivalent of Debbie Matenopoulos: "duniya mein a kar farishtoon nay declare illegal karna hai?" </p>

<p><b>update:</b> Apparently SMS (TXT messsaging) is shut down across Pakistan on the order of the State. </p>
