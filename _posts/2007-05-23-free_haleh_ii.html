  content: "Thanks for keeping this topic alive at your site and providing links to
    updates and related cases. As I've looked around at commentary and responses appearing
    at other sites, a couple of things struck me.\r\n\r\nOne commentary concluded
    that it is foolish for American citizens to travel to countries where they have
    been officially warned not to go, and then rely on government action and public
    outcries to bail them out when they're trapped like Dr. Esfandiari. As Shaul Bakhash
    pointed out in his interview, they did not perceive this possible threat or she
    would not have gone. Well, they were mistaken, but I hope it isn't foolish to
    count on our officials and the public to apply whatever means are at their disposal
    to work for her release, or of any other person where the case is so clearcut.\r\n\r\nWhich
    brings me to another observation, which is that inevitably some will raise the
    issue of all the other cases of illegally incarcerated people all over the world,
    chastising us for caring only about this one individual belonging to a special
    group (in this case an academic). In fact it is a reasonable issue to bring up,
    but the implication that everyone interested in Haleh Esfandiari must by default
    \ care ONLY about her is, I am confident, a grievous overgeneralization. One has
    only to go to a site like Amnesty International (or to any number of blog-sites
    like this one) to get a broader perspective on the detained and the disappeared,
    to say the least. I think the right attitude is to be neither complacent nor cowed
    by guilt when taking any step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes"

  content: "About Robin Wright's article: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201406.html?nav=emailpage\r\n\r\nI
    think this is true:\r\n\r\nAnalysts suggested that the new tensions may be related
    to talks Monday in Baghdad between U.S. and Iranian diplomats on Iraq's future.\r\n\r\n\"There
    is a clique of powerful officials who have entrenched financial and political
    interests in Iran's status quo isolation and don't want to see any improvement
    in the U.S.-Iran relationship,\" said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment
    for International Peace.\r\n\r\nBut that is deeply counterproductive and plays
    right into the hands of those factions in the government that want to block dialogue
    between the US and Iran:\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the House introduced a bipartisan resolution
    yesterday demanding that Iran free Esfandiari. It was co-sponsored by Reps. Chris
    Van Hollen (D), Elijah E. Cummings (D) and Wayne T. Gilchrest (R), all of Maryland,
    along with Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) and Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).\r\n\r\nAnd Zalman,
    I agree that groups like Amnesty International care about more than Haleh Esfandiari,
    but given that she has a relationship with Washington, don't
    you think it's interesting that Congress has passed a resolution
    about her? Who else have they done that for? Anyone being held in countries that
    are political allies of the US government.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    it's right that's she's
    been arrested and the spate of arrests is worrying in general. But I think we
    need to keep in mind the general context of up coming talks (and the power struggles
    in the US government), as well as the generally hostile policy of the US towards
    Iran. Witness the show of force in the Gulf and the continuous attempts to undermine
    Iranian sovereignty across all its borders. Any action taken for Haleh and other
    scholars must be taken with this in mind so as to not aid the designs of reactionary
    forces in Iran and the US."

  content: "Maggot:\r\n\r\nI agree with you on every point. We should always have
    in mind the overall political context whenever we look at these cases. On the
    other hand, I always hope the wider implications won't prevent us from doing the
    right thing for the individuals involved. In any case, we obviously have to do
    a lot more than sign petitions; certainly as citizens we have to act wherever
    we can to move our politicians from both sides toward active dialog and viable
    political solutions."

<p><a href="http://www.gmu.edu/robinson/bakhash.htm">Shaul Bakhash</a>, Clarence Robinson Professor of History, George Mason University, Brookings Institution senior fellow and husband of U.S. Middle East analyst Haleh Esfandiari, will be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/05/23/DI2007052301352.html?hpid=topnews">online Thursday, May 24, at 12:15 p.m. ET</a> to discuss his wife's detainment by Iranian intelligence for "crimes against national security" and personal and worldwide reaction to the situation.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that the <i>WaPo</i> reporter <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/articles/robin+wright/">Robin Wright</a> has been doing an amazing job keeping this scholar's plight in the news. She just <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201406_pf.html">reported</a> that <a href="http://www.kiantajbakhsh.com/">Kian Tajbakhsh</a> - another Iranian-American scholar - has been detained in Tehran.</p>
