<p>As you know, <i>The Atlantic</i> has opened up its archives for free - following <i>NYT</i> etc. </p>
<p>I recommend, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/193604/young-kipling">The Young Kipling</a>, December 1887 -  extracts from letters and diaries of a young American girl living in Allahabad and getting to know Kipling.</p>
<p>"<i>How Kipling does love those wild men of the North! He calls them his own folk. They are savage, boastful, arrogant, and hot-headed, and these vagrant loafers, snaky-lipped and vulture-eyed, come to pay their respects to him.</i>"</p>
<p>Mighty good reading - for yourself or your class. </p>
