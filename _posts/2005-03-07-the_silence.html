    Last year I attended a lecture by an anthropology professor who had been studying sufism. He discussed an interesting case where he came across a manuscript written by one of the Moroccan sufi orders that detailed breathing techniques. It attributed the techniques to the "al-Jokia" sufi order. He did a bit of research and deduced that it was actually referring to the "Jogis" of India.

    Sorry, I know that doesn't answer your question, and well, it doesn't have much to do with the topic at hand... ermmm... okay...

  content: how about south of the deccan? not that i have too many sources, but i
    did see some interesting stuff from the sufis and kings of the deccan. certain
    forms of bharatnatyam and other traditional dances were throughly studied and
    their manuals translated by the muslims of the deccan. additionally, the sinhala
    buddhist texts in pali were published by muslim merchants of yemeni origin (still
    in pali) in sri lanka. so maybe more crossover and interest in the south?

  content: "The question of why the medieval period relationship between Islam and
    Hinduism in South Asia is characterized above all by a mutual textual 'silence'
    is one that has been posed several times from both sides.  As our gentle blogger
    points out, there are no comparable parallels to the much-celebrated Ummayad and
    Abbasid Greek-Arabic translation projects.   'Heresiologists' such as al-Biruni
    (and we can perhaps also add the later figure al-Shahristani) are notable exceptions
    to a scenario in which sustained state-sponsored inquiry into the religious practices
    of 'Hindus' (a category which did not exist in anything like the present form
    until the late Mughal period at the earliest, and debatably the British colonial
    period) simply did not occur.  Likewise, it has often been noted that for the
    entire career of the first South Asian Muslim dynasties, the Delhi Sultanate and
    the early Mughals, only very rarely are Muslims or Islam mentioned in Sanskrit
    texts, and then usually in terms ethnic difference (no attempt is made to understand
    the peculiar cultural practices of 'Turushkas').  There are of course some exceptions
    on both sides (dharmashatra texts prescribing rituals for purification of captured
    and converted brahman women, the work of Biruni and Shahristani, etc), but the
    general scenario of 'silence' between the Muslims and other religious communities
    in the subcontinent prevails.  Why this scenario, of what seems from all accounts
    to be a mutual indifference?   I am not convinced by the idea that Sepoy floats
    here that the reason for Muslim lack of interest in Hinduism is 'idolophobia'.
    \ Certainly, some of the dynamic driving translations in Damascus and Baghdad
    may well have been the fact that a lot of the issues raised in Greek and Aramaic
    texts would have been shared by Muslim religious scholars (prophetologies and
    messianic ideas of Abrahamic monotheism).  To a significant degree, however, I
    suspect questions of practical utility impelled the production of most translations
    into Arabic here.  Specifically, the scientific (medical, architectural, agricultural)
    and political knowledges enshrined in these texts would have been very useful
    indeed for the elites of newly emergent polities grounded in a civilizational
    formation (Islam) that was just beginning to define itself, at the same time as
    rapidly expanding into new and diverse regions (the Abbasid period signals a crisis
    of identity from which time Islam gradually ceases to be a characteristically
    Arab religion). Following this line of argument, then, translation into Arabic
    apprears not so much as a matter of desire to understand a Greek or Aramaic 'other',
    but because of a percieved utility of these knowledges (or to put it in other
    terms, an attractiveness of the political and civilizational aesthetics present
    here).    Thinking along these lines, one has to question why translations
    from Sanskrit would have been produced by Muslim rulers in Delhi in the first
    half of the second millennium CE (thinking about why Sanskrit writers did not
    write about Muslims is another question entirely).  No doubt specific forms of
    knowledge (architectural, military, agricultural, literary) that existed in South
    Asia were important to the articulation of Muslim authority there.  But perhaps
    the situation was fundamentally different from that in the 'old Islamic lands'
    in a way that made translations, especially from Sanskrit, completely unnecessary.
    \   While you have a very high level of conversion to Islam and Arabization
    in the Ummayad and Abbasid periods, and extensive Arabic influence on what was
    to become classical Persian; there is much less conversion in South Asia excepting
    regions that were not yet extensively into settled agrarian and textually dominated
    societies, and even that was more of a gradual acculturation process.  The rapid
    extension of legal zimmi (often translated as 'tolerated minority) status to Hindus
    and Buddhists, the continuing numerical predominance of the latter and the general
    trend of maintenance of established textual traditions (for a while at least)
    suggests a different scenario than in lands further West.  Evidence of the integration
    of vernacular styles into early South Asian Muslim mosques suggests the collaborration
    of 'native' architects and artisans.  Whether because of relative military weaknesss
    of Muslim dynasties, the pervasiveness of subcontinental socio-religious allegiances
    (I will leave aside Nirad Chaudhuri-esque notions of the siren-like and transformative
    attraction of Indic culture's inscrutable essence), the history of Islam in South
    Asia is very much a story of the success of projects to accommodate cultural differnce
    towards the end of running a stable and productive society.  This being the case,
    I think it makes sense to develop different scholarly languages and categories
    to talk about Islam in South Asia (and perhaps other regions that remained only
    incompletely Islamized such as subsaharan Africa or Southeast Asia), ones informed
    by evidence of the accommodation of difference and related persistance of both
    major vernacular and alternative civilizational ways of being.  Muslim architecture
    in South Asia  from the beginning demostrates significant influence of vernacular
    styles and collaborration with native artisans and builders.  The case is similar
    with regards to music, cuisine, military technology, scientific knowledge and
    so forth.     Why might Sanskrit in particular not have piqued the interest
    of Muslim scholars in the subcontinent?  Some of it might have to do with the
    character of Sanskrit literacy - access to Sanskrit was rigidly circumscribed,
    and principles of exclusion were most important with regards to 'Hindus' of lower
    social status.  Secondly, if we follow Sheldon Pollock, by the time of the Delhi
    Sultanate Sanskrit for the most part was a language of high rhetoric and political
    poetry; emerging vernaculars were already used to convey anything related to the
    nuts and bolts of material life (laws, land grants, taxation records, etc).  So
    making translations from Sanskrit would not have been of any great practical utility
    to Muslim rulers in the subcontinent.  If Muslim political elites needed to access
    any forms of knowledge enshrined in Sanskrit, there were professionals attached
    to the courts who could do the needful with regards to medical, legal, architectural
    knowledge.  I think the case with vernaculars is a whole different story, and
    here is where cultrual exchanges in the fields of mysticism, literature and performative
    traditions (often closely linked) such as those Wanderer refers to make the scene
    (both the north and south bear numerous examples, from Ali Adil Shah Sani's dhrupads
    to Jayasi's jogi-esque poetry).   I would by no means accuse Sepoy of taking
    up cudgels on behalf of the two nation theory anachronistically applied (an accusation
    which he attempts to fend of in advance), but I tend to see the frequent derisions
    of idolatry (shirk or but-parati) in Persian and Urdu literatures (not too familiar
    with the Arabic) not so much as an explanation for indifference towards Hinduism,
    but more as a rhetorical device that goes along with conquest of resistant states
    and carting off booty by the truckload.  The question of why and when exactly
    alternative modes for representing non-Muslims in classical Islamicate literatures
    (Persian and Arabic) and substantive translation projects begin to emerge in South
    Asia is a different one.  I would be interested to hear views on how conditions
    or perspectives change such that this becomes the common practice (I also do not
    find the notion of Akbar's Din-i Ilahi or 'wacky new-agey religion' to be especially
    compelling)."

    "If one compares the translation projects of Greek and Armaic sources into Arabic during the 9th-11th centuries in Damascus and Baghdad with the projects undertaken for Sanskrit, one realizes that there were no projects undertaken for Sanskrit."

    This assumes the Muslim Indian dynasties (and the greatest of them, the Moghuls) had the same interests as the Abbassids. Is the translation of non-Islamic religious works an integral feature of Muslim empires? What allows us to make this assumption? Perhaps in the Abbasid empire "intellectual" pursuits (science, philosophy, theology) were more valued than in the courts of the Moghuls who valued so-called "decedant pursuits" like art, poetry and literature? Maybe there is something about the confidence of the intellectual culture in latter-day Muslim empires that meant the challenge of "other religions" was not so important anymore (cf. with the early theological debates where kalam gradually gained acceptance after initially being rejected). Or maybe there are a multitude of "causes"?

    Still I wouldn't be surprised if, at a local level, there was some sort of _rapprochment_ which had important consequences for popular religion (which is not always the same as the bookish religion of the intellegentsia).

    "Is it the hubris of monotheists amid polytheists?"

    The Greeks were a pretty polytheistic bunch. Christianity is regarded in many Muslim quarters as "polytheistic". Also, is it neccesary to regard the various "sects" of Hinduism as "polythestic"? Some appear, to a layman reading from quite a distance, close to Christian/Islamic "theism".

    "Is idolatry just the rawest of raw nerve of Islam?"

    Self-evident I'd have thought.

    "One thinks of the cathartic idol-smashing of Muhammad on his triumphant return to Mecca...One thinks of Somnath itself"

    Difference between the two being that the former claimed Mecca as the home of the One True God of Abraham (whom the Arabs recognised as their father) that had been corrupted. He was "restoring" the Original True Religion. Ghazni et al. claimed to be bringing the True Religion to new lands in the service of their One True God.

    "One thinks of the severity of iconoclasm established in the earliest centuries."

    We're a pretty iconoclastic bunch, aren't we? The insides of churches were, however, not too affected. Nor were, it seems, ancient Egyptian artefacts during this period.

    "One thinks of the Wahhabi reaction to the rise of the Sufi shrines."

    Also see a history of the ahl-e-hadith in India. Many orthodox reformers of India were also Sufis, starting with Ahmad as-Sirhindi.

    dacoit: Yes, there are a lot of "silences". And your point about "practical utility" has been made elsewhere. My question, though, was really towards religious understanding. Not administrative, scientific or medical knowledges. Medieval Muslim kings, when not fighting for their political life had opportunities to put forth a program of study: It could  have been as simple as representing the 'other' as heretics or as serious as trying to understand the faith of those you govern.

    Anyways. This was just some idle doodling on Monday morning. I don't want to go too much into the production of various literary cultures.

    thabet: umm, ok. Let me go see a history of ahl-e hadith in India. Must have missed it.

  content: 'My memory is a bit rusty on this but two thoughts come to me in regard
    to your question:  1) the initial and indeed most of the Greek translation project
    was the product of Greek schools still existing in the early Muslim period and/or
    the product of Christian translators.  2) The great Muslim incursions into India,
    other than early trade delegations were Turkish dynasties (fleeing from other
    Turkish dynasties) who depended on Persian court culture, i.e. a culture to which
    they were not native and which must have resulted in a the least some serious
    cultural diglossia - for a great period of time their cultural eyes were fixed
    far to the west.  From what I remember of the Ghaznavids, for example, I don''t
    think that they exhibited much religious curiosity even toward their own putative
    religion.'

    in the early fourteenth century, did have some theological debates with jain monks

    who's written the big book on MBT.... barni particularly reviled him for this... and
    amir khusro, with his unabashed hinduki, did serve seven sultans... the rulers,
    imho, probably kept away from 'hinduism' becuase of the fact that the sufis were
    \ so open to it... and the sufis served as oppositional forces to the throne,
    so you needed to rely on the more conservative ulama as a sort of support base...
    and hence you couldn't be seen as being too inquisitive about those damn infidels...
     what i find realy interesting is that akbar's syncretism 'from above' comes
    about a century after the beginning of a great syncretic movements 'from below'...
    kabir, nanak, dadu... which take elements from both 'hinduism' and islam but refused

    Anand: Good point re: Tughluq's conversations. The sufis, though, weren't all that interested in Hinduism per se.

    Recently, I sat through a paper that posited a revision of Dara Shikoh on various grounds; chief amongst them being that his interest in Hinduism wasn't to understand that cosmology but to "incorporate" it into Islamic cosmology. Hinduism [a particularly theistic interpretation] becomes an earlier, corrupted message of  God - a message perfected and renewed by Islam. Sounds Macaulayish.

    I should perhaps say more about this in a sep. post.

<p><img src="/img/prince_ascetic.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>A bit curious, historically, is the lack of interest the Muslims rulers of India took in Hinduism. If one compares the translation projects of Greek and Armaic sources into Arabic during the 9th-11th centuries in Damascus and Baghdad with the projects undertaken for Sanskrit, one realizes that <i>there were no projects undertaken for Sanskrit</i>. Not until Akbar, was such a project carried out. That's the sixteenth century! Muslims and Hindus have been rubbing elbows since the sixth.<br />
So what accounts for this lack of curiosity in their religion? Is it the hubris of monotheists amid polytheists? Was only the intellectual family of Abraham worthy of study? [hmm...they did wipe those Zorastrians out pretty quickly]. Can I ask the same question re: Buddhism? [harder that, because of the Great Escape of Buddhism from India early into the Muslim reign].</p>
<p>Let's do a faulty memory review. Leave aside <i>Kalila wa Dimna</i> which was a Sanskrit text translated into Pahlavi and from there into Arabic by AbdAllah ibn Muqaffa in 750 or so. We know that Indian physicians and alchemists were present in the 'Abbasid courts where they presumabley gave the Arabs the numeric system [and the number Zero] but nothing survives of any texts that they translated. In any case, these were not religious texts. The only early Muslim intellectual who paid any attention to the Hinduism as a religion was al-Biruni [d. 1048].  He translated portions of the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and Patanjali's <i>Yogasutras</i>. After him, silence again from the Muslim intellectuals. The <i>Mahabharata</i> was translated into Persian in Kashmir way later in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Akbar, they say, instituted a system of translations to augment his wacky new-agey religion. I am not a fan of that particular hypothesis but let's keep moving on here. The fact is that he did commission an amazing amount of Sanskrit works [<i>Mahabharata</i> becomes <i>Razmnama</i>] to be translated into Persian and vice versa. The translated works were used mainly as poIitical histories of India by Muslim chroniclers [Farishta, for example, uses the <i>Mahabharta</i> as a chronology of Indian history]. It was Akbar's grandson Dara Shukuh [d. 1659] who really set the ball rolling in terms of puranic and yogic translations - as religious texts. He oversaw the translations of the Upanishads [<i>Sirr-i Akbar</i>]. He had in his court <i>munshis</i> like, the one CM friend Rajeev is working on, Chandarbhan Brahman who translated vedantic works into Persian. Dara Shukuh's project was more about mingling the twin streams of mysticism then a serious inquiry into the religious life of the populace. He treated the Upanishads as literal equivalents of the Qur'an. This study by analogy will sound pretty familiar to the colonial translation projects that will follow shortly. Cue William Jones and the EIC initiatives.  </p>
<p>Back to our Monday Morning Quaterbacking. Why were the Muslims not interested in Hinduism? Either, Hinduism becomes a colonial created text [which would explain the immense output of persian translations in the early modern period but which will also take this post in an entirely different direction] OR:</p>
<p>Is idolatry just the rawest of  raw nerve of Islam? Idolophobia? [my neologism for the day] One thinks of the cathartic idol-smashing of Muhammad on his triumphant return to Mecca. One thinks of the severity of iconoclasm established in the earliest centuries. One thinks of the famous episode when Muhammad b. Qasim enters a temple for the first time [ok, only I think of that since no one else even knows about that]. One thinks of Sa'adi's Indiana Jonesesque adventure in Somnath. One thinks of Somnath itself. One thinks of the rise of Sufi shrines. One thinks of the Wahhabi reaction to the rise of the Sufi shrines. </p>
<p>I am just wondering out aloud. I don't really have an answer for this silence. Lack of curiosity is not something I can accuse Muslim rulers of India in any other area of. I am also aware that my over-generalization leaves me up for ridicule on the "immutable category of 'Muslim' against 'Hinduism'" front. So, I am an idiot. But my question remains. Why were the Muslims of India not curious about the faith of those they governed? Especially since they did show such curiosity with respect to Judaism, Christianity and Zorastrianism. Why did this cow not moo? </p>
<p><b>unrelated</b>: One of these days, I will look for my interest in politics. It is around somewhere. For now, I find the recent triumphalism [after Lebanon's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4315223.stm">Gucci Revolution</a> - look Rob, cleavage!] of Bush's agenda a tad moronic. I mean millions show up when Hamas or Hizbullah throw a parade against the Israelis or the Americans and that is not a "revolution!" for terrorism? David Adesnik can go plow the fields of Iraq for his democracy. Juan Cole <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2005/03/foreign-occupation-has-produced.html">says</a> something right and something not quite but I approve of his general thrust.</p>
