    the DPs, of course) for a generation or three, if we don't get sane pretty damn

  content: "Manam you are somewhat exaggerating the issue in my view. What the paper
    is suggesting is to outsource more of the war to Pakistan - more action against
    Afghan Taliban and in return more aid, better trade relations, efforts to improve
    Indo-Pak relations and commitment to Afghanistan for the long haul. Seems rational
    from their perspective: much cheaper (economically and politically) to get Pakistan
    to fight than get into the business yourself.   And really. What makes you
    think Pakistan is somehow better off with not taking action against the Taliban?
    Local grievances are legitimate but they do not justify taking the law in your
    hands. If I think I should be allowed to drink and get laid before marriage, it
    doesn't mean I can take up weapons against the state.  The Americans are
    not in Pakistan for state building or nation building and they shouldn't be. That's
    our job."

  content: "To A., your blind faith in the state or law is a glaring example of the
    brainwashing success.  How does one equate law and state to be moral or right?
    Tell your more aid as an incentive to the millions of families that have lost
    their homes, thousands who are losing families or limbs, perhaps they can be soothed
    by the prospect of more aid to pakistani military who did this to them or improved
    indo-pak relationship as it means a lot to them while they are living for a few
    generations in tents, their women more likely to be raped, their kids instead
    of going to school learning to beg, perhaps some of those people who got the aid
    every now and then can spare a few coins when these children beg from them but
    mostly likely ignore them or better curse at them for making their new car dirty
    with their hands touching it.  Certainly seems rational from the imperialistic
    perspective to get the \"salves\" to do the dirty work but even if you and those
    benefiting from the aid and better trade etc. don't see themselves in the same
    category as the ones getting bombed out of their homes and thus can arrogantly
    dismissive their grievances as national building for you, maybe it will help to
    realize as Harry Belafonte compared Colin Powers and Condi Rice to being \"house
    niggers\" who gets to enjoy the inside of the masters house as long as they do
    what the master wants but that you are still a \"nigger (i am assuming he meant
    enslaved to master's game plan for you)\" as is the plantation one.  Alas, the
    British leaving our region did not end our enslaved mentality."

    to do anything against Quetta. I read the responses; nearly half were Americans
    unhappy about Pakistan and its government's duplicitious nature. The other half
    were self-important Indians. Very Self-Important Indians.  There was maybe
    one person from Pakistan itself.  And going back historically, the real
    reason for going into Swat and Waziristan can be summed up in three letters. T.T.P.  There
    is no TTP in Quetta. And war is wrong unless the state is threatened."

    am simply suggesting that the editorial is calling for a grand bargain whereby
    both the US and Pakistan govts.  make efforts. It is more than the usual \"bomb
    balochistan\" crap. And the tone of the first quote of this post is typical of
    the normative nature of the times editorials. It is also misleading when presented
    out of context.  It is asking for the US to show a long term commitment
    to Afghanistan and make efforts to improve Indo-Pak talks. What they are saying
    is that enough needs to be done so that the US and its allies can be on the right
    side of Pakistan's strategic calculation. Read again. I am not saying its rational
    from our perspective. I am saying it is rational from <i>their</i> perspective.
      Second, are you suggesting that people in Swat were somehow happy living
    under the Taliban? You choose: 1.5 Million Pakistani under Taliban rule or 1.5
    Million Pakistani IDPs most of whom go back to their hometown within 4 to 6 months.  And
    lastly who do you think will benefit from Special Economic Zones in FATA?"

  content: "Professor, this is written in common man language, so please translate
    into proper terms in your head as you read it: The problem is this:  the GREAT
    SATAN (I am not being sarcastic) America was attacked by Islamist terrorists.
    These terrorists were headquartered in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Their whole network
    was protected and nurtured by Jihadi officers in the Pak army. When one part of
    this network attacked America, probably without the knowledge of the ISI, there
    was a violent response ...which is what the jihdadis wanted...these are cold blooded
    killers whose aims stretch out to generations. They WANTED a war with America
    and they got it, they are not unhappy with the situation, they are reveling in
    it.  At that point, the morons who lead the Pak army suddenly realized that
    this terrorism game (which they were really playing against low quality players
    like India and Uzbekistan) was not \"khala ji ka ghar\". It was deadly serious,
    with the emphasis on \"deadly\". So the head moron, Musharraf, had the bare minimum
    common sense to switch sides.  But being a moron, he still hoped that one day
    Amrika will leave and we and the good taliban and  \"good jihadis\" like Lashkar
    Tayaba will go back to playing our little games with India. Well, that has not
    happened. Even a peace loving nice guy like Obama is not willing to just leave
    and give everything back to the jihadis. So the choice is this: 1. take a stand
    for jihad and face whatever the infidels (USA, NATO, India, Afghanistan, Iran
    and Russia, with even China sympathizing with them) can throw at you.  OR 2.
    Really switch sides, and help the infidels isolate the terrorist network till
    its a police problem and there is no chance of their capturing a state or using
    the resources of a state.   Both options involve pain. But then, that is
    what we have been saying for 30 years. This is not \"bachon kee duniya\", this
    is nasty business. The best choice would have been to never get into this dirty
    game. Now, you have to get out kicking and screaming, or beat everyone else at
    it. Take your pick..."

    isolating the buggers is/was never a problem in Sindh (I'm in Karachi); it's doing
    the same in Punjab, Balochistan and especially NWFP that is the real challenge.
    And Azad Kashmir as well.  If you just stick to Punjab, there's Jhang, a
    festering hole of sectarian hate (thats coming from a Karachi-ite, LOL). Then
    theres the various support networks offered by the legitimate Islamist parties.
    Add to that sympathisers in the educated classes linked to the political Islamist
    parties.  And most importantly the madrassas and a lack of real education
    options to travel around in for poor people.  Then there's the bigotry within
    the official education system as well.  And multiple ungoverned areas within
    NWFP, Sindh and Balochistan.  Should I go on?"

    don't know if India is interested in lowering tensions so that one section of
    Pakistani society can force out of strength the parts of Pakistani society that
    thrive on hatred.  And yes, add to that the fact that the fanatical element
    is trying rouse the lower classes to carry out an Islamic Revolution al&Atilde;&nbsp;

  content: "The best way to disprove NYT's assertion is to  check the hospital logs
    in Quetta for the period (1995-97). If there is a sudden spike in shrapnel wounds,
    then our enterprising historian will attempt to find who paid for the treatment.
    He/she also love archives and hates to bend facts to the service of narrow ideological
    schemes, so he/she will proceed to the obituary sections for the local newspapers
    and/or ask the natives for the number of dead during that period. The intrepid
    historian will also find out the few large tent and party supply businesses in
    Quetta and ask to see business records for the period, or simply ask the owners
    to recollect whether they did cater to funerals and fundraisers, and if so, who
    for. Just to make sure, may be she can check the archives for the Guardian too
    (circa. 2003). Then we will know that the Taliban were just \"discovered\" in
    Quetta, and not there all along, and we will all laugh so hard at NYT! It will
    be a riot.   Pakistan has done quite a lot in fighting the Taliban, for
    example shutting down Afghan refugee camps and throwing them over the border (http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1060936.html).
    \ So No! Just as Mexico has no right in demanding that the US control its arms
    market, the US has no right to ask Pakistan to control entities within its territory
    that threaten the sovereignty of its neighbor that is just emerging from conflict.  (P.S.
    I am not defending the \"striking at the heart\" business. Not everything can
    and should be reduced to war.)"

  content: "\"The most common American complaint one now hears about Pakistan's
    security establishment&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;expressed yet again by Hillary Clinton
    at a congressional hearing on Thursday&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is that it is &ldquo;obsessed&rdquo;
    with India. Her exasperated tone makes this obsession seem purely irrational,
    an unnecessary diversion from the urgent task of combating anti-American extremists
    in the region. But Pakistan is growing ever more fearful of an economically stronger
    India and its new intimacy with the United States. Convinced that America will
    turn away from Islamabad just as it did after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
    in 1989, Pakistan's military leaders will be increasingly reluctant
    to fall in line with Obama's announced objectives. They may
    well launch a few token crackdowns on militants, but they are unlikely to abandon
    the possibility of allowing some of them to remain in reserve in order to unleash
    them, at a later date, upon India-ruled Kashmir. As always, the road to stability
    in Pakistan and Afghanistan runs through the valley of Kashmir, and Obama's
    failure to even mention a likely solution to the subcontinent's
    primary conflict will doom his new strategy just as surely as his other decision
    to continue assassinating suspected militants with drone missiles.\" Pankaj Mishra

    - By the way, Omar, I have never, as best as I can recall, thrown any terms at
    you and I don't believe in \"loyalty pledges\" either (with us or with the terrorists,
    with us or with the Infidel/Kuffar/AmericanHinjews etc. etc.).   &ldquo;Can
    you keep your militarism and eat it too?&rdquo; is a valid question
    one needs to keep in mind while fulminating about the jihadis of Jamia Qadsia.
    Hannah Arendt talks about the boomerang effect and about the means deployed against
    \"them\" coming around to be used on \"us\" eventually. Aim&Atilde;&copy; C&Atilde;&copy;saire:
    [Hitler] \"applied to Europe the Colonial practices that had previously been applied
    only to the Arabs of Algeria, the coolies of India and the Negros of Africa.\"  Other
    than \"The Duel\" and a few articles, I haven't read much of what Tariq Ali has
    written, so I'll welcome the opportunity to read/hear an assessment of him. May
    be we won't have to wait for the arrival of the Trotskyite utopia, for you to
    shed some light on your fascination with Tariq Ali or at least why you incessantly
    refer to him."

    you have read or not read. Like you, I am arguing with imaginary persons. Allow
    some leeway.  Tariq Ali comes up a lot in many of my arguments because some
    of my Pakistani liberal/leftist friends used to quote him a lot. As we get to
    know each other, our arguments can become more specific. I will stop using his
    name to you. About using \"those terms\". No need to get offended. Did I say
    you used any of those terms? I was imagining our adda in lahore ten years down
    the road and flippantly throwing in some terms that get used in such addas. You
    dont use any of them, good for you. Dont take it too personally. \"Can i keep
    my militarism and eat it too\"? I dont think so.  Or at least not to some infinite
    extent. On the other hand, \"I\" have been keeping it and eating it for a hundred
    years, so it seems it takes a while to run out, especially if you are rich and
    are doing it on behalf of a whole slew of rich countries that will sort of help
    out with expenses.  If you are a near bankrupt small country, then its much
    harder to have your jihad and eat it too..... This is not a \"my dick is bigger
    than yours\" argument. I just mean that there is such a thing as punching above
    your weight. I think the ISI has figured that out by now (which is probably why
    they are getting bombed every day). Someday, maybe they will tell Ahmed Qureshi
    to let the rest of the country know... The world is not fair. I am not approving
    of its unfairness. Like Bill Clinton, I feel your pain. I just think that in this
    particular case, push has come to shove and I think its best to give in on this
    issue and drop the jihadi dream.   In fact, i think that is being done already,
    but in Pak army fashion, they have managed get the hundred onions as well as the
    hundred slaps. But, it is what it is. You and I are both out of the loop, so lets
    not fight.  Baqi aap kee marzi."

  content: "\"Do people understand that Balochistan is an entire problem unto itself?
    Newsflash, brainiacs at the NYT editorial board: there has been a low level civil
    war simmering in Balochistan since 2004. This follows the medium level civil war
    in Balochistan in the mid 1970s. Both times, the military went in, and both times,
    as the Pakistani military is wont to do, there wasn't a great deal of demonstrated
    concern for collateral damage.  The people of Balochistan have been denied
    basic political and economic rights, both by the central government and their
    nationalist so-called leaders for fifty years now. The last month has seen significant
    developments in this conflict, with the center -- in the hands of the PPP -- presenting
    a reform package aimed at placating Balochi nationalism, without much success
    (at least at this early juncture). If you opened a Pakistani newspaper in the
    last thirty days, you would know this. It has dominated the news, even more so
    than the Taliban war.  Why do I bring this up? Because launching drone strikes
    in Balochistan, and the inevitable civilian casualties that will result, will
    exacerbate this problem in very serious and predictable ways. I feel stupid even
    writing this. But apparently it is needed.  Here's how it will play out:
    Balochi grievances will congeal into both an anti-Pakistan narrative and an anti-anti-Taliban
    one. The storyline will be that the state has sold out Balochi land to foreign
    forces, when it wasn't even theirs to sell. Balochistan has long chafed under
    the hard-nosed attitude of Pakistani central governments, both military and civilian,
    toward provincial autonomy and federalism. Can you imagine how it will react if
    and when Pakistan gives the go-ahead for American drones to strike in Quetta?
    Or even less ambitiously, can you imagine the military making a foray into Balochistan
    again? At this time?  Get a clue, NYT.\" http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/12/08/strategy_and_war_in_pakistan_and_afghanistan"

    and centre, how could the Baloch fail to see a tacit complicity of the Pakistan
    military behind every drone? \"  http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/08/pakistan-cia-unmanned-drones-balochistan"

  content: "Would the Balochi nationalists really be that upset at drone strikes aimed
    at Pashtun radicals emplaced and enabled by the Pakistani Army? If JUI's presence
    in Balochistan is weakened because of said strikes, I'd imagine the Bugtis and
    their allies would be quite pleased.  That said, I don't think we will see
    drone strikes in Quetta despite what Seth Jones would like. A major metropolitan
    area like Quetta is a big difference from a small town in FATA. Note the complete
    absence of any drone strike anywhere near such a major city even in Afghanistan."

  content: Given how accurate the drone attacks have become, I dont see why the Baloch
    nationalists would feel precision strikes against the jihadi network are in any
    way harmful to them. The people scared of drone attacks are the jihadis and their
    supporters, not the Baloch nationalists (and yes, I have asked some of them and
    they would like nothing better. How many have you checked with before you came
    up with your theory?)

<p> "Yet the Army leadership is refusing to strike at the heart of the Taliban command in Baluchistan Province." declares another editorial from NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/opinion/08tue1.html">today</a>. If only these Pakistanis would realize - <em>why won't they just realize</em> - that this is their wars, not ours.</p>
<p>Think back to March 2009. Then, the Taliban were on a march to Islamabad - mere 60 miles away - and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27mon1.html">editorial </a> chided the Pakistani army and civilian elite of not understanding their mortal threat. Invade Swat, became a mantra of pundits and editorials alike. After hemming and hawing - and filling up its coffers - the Pakistani Army did. It went in with guns blazing from every hill-top. It watched the million walk out of the valley with their houses gone and their livelihoods vanished. Never did the NYT or the Administration pause to even consider what were the local histories, the local demands, the causes which would have allowed the Taliban any foothold at all in Swat. Not once was Swat's precarious constitutional structure discussed or attention paid to the Swati demands for expedient justice, equal opportunities and resource sharing. Not once. The drums of war drown out any other voice. All the Empire seeks is immediate action. In the here and in the now. </p>
<p>Then, in August 2009 came the second wave. The real battle is in Waziristan, not Swat where the Taliban's real base exists. Why won't the Pakistani army move in there already? Why are the wasting time in Swat? The timing was also good for a Pakistani "invasion" since Baitullah Mehsud had just been killed. Once again, the Army dithered until just long enough before finally launching an operation into N. Waziristan. Once again, the local population fled - but this time there were no IDP camps and no relief efforts. Apparently "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/20/islamabad-university-atta_n_326886.html">most had relatives in the region</a>". Go figure that one out. </p>
<p>And because frontiers are "always empty", the Taliban are now going to Baluchistan. So, let us send the Pakistani Army after them. It is fun, no? This chasing. Like a global game of tag. Get serious, Pakistan Army! Get into Baluchistan and crush those Taliban. Once again, who cares if the reality matches any of our discourse. Who cares that Baluchistan is not empty, and that it already <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091105/REVIEW/711059990/1192">has a war</a>. </p>
<p>All clear?</p>
<p>Step 1: NYT (representing the Administration, of course) decries Pakistani Army needs to get serious on Taliban.<br />
Step 2: Pakistani Army provides a suitable window of dithering, during which time a number of prominent pundits add their voice to the enfolding crisis.<br />
Step 3: Pakistani Army gets more $ and then moves in to the "central area" in order to combat the Talibothra.<br />
Step 4-40: Ignore any local issues; ignore the blowback of drones; ignore the constant bomb blasts in Peshawer, Lahore, Multan; ignore any political realities. Enjoy! </p>
