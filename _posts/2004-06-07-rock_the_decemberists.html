<p><img src="/img/decemberists.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Friday night we went to see the <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">Decemberists</a> at the Metro. The opening bands were kinda boring (the Long Winters' last song did rock) but, no matter, since we were there solely for Colin Meloy and his crew. This was the second time I have seen them - caught them at the Schubas April 1 as well.<br />
The concert was amazing. These are some serious musicians who know how to use discordant harmonies, melodic transformations and 19th century vocabulary to construct one hell of a rock song. The best thing about this Portland quartet is the way their lyrics interact with their music. The highlight of the night, for me, was the extended version of Chimbley Sweep with Rachel Blumberg doing some amazing vocal tricks.<br />
Anyways, highly recommend you give this original (i call it grad-rock) American band a listen and catch them live if they come to your neck of the woods.</p>
