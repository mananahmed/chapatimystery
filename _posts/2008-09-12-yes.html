  content: "\"Muslin is a type of finely-woven cotton fabric, introduced to Europe
    from the Middle East in the 17th century. Its first recorded use in England was
    in 1670. It was named for the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul,
    in what is now Iraq, but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is
    now Bangladesh.\"\r\n\r\nI'd wear that."

  content: "Obama himself didn't do much to quell this particular \"slur\". \r\n\"What
    is disturbing about the campaign's response is that it leaves unchallenged the
    disgraceful and racist premise behind the entire \"Muslim smear\": that being
    Muslim is de facto a source of shame. Obama's supporters often say they are being
    \"Swiftboated,\" casually accepting the idea that being accused of Muslimhood
    is tantamount to being accused of treason. Substitute another faith or ethnicity,
    and you'd expect a very different response. Consider a report from the archives
    of this magazine. Thirteen years ago, Daniel Singer, The Nation's late, much-missed
    Europe correspondent, went to Poland to cover a hotly contested presidential election.
    He reported that the race had descended into an ugly debate over whether one of
    the candidates, Aleksander Kwasniewski, was a closet Jew. The press claimed his
    mother had been buried in a Jewish cemetery (she was still alive), and a popular
    TV show aired a skit featuring the Christian candidate dressed as a Hasidic Jew.
    \"What perturbed me,\" Singer wryly observed, \"was that Kwasniewski's lawyers
    threatened to sue for slander rather than press for an indictment under the law
    condemning racist propaganda.\" \r\n\"Occasionally, though not nearly enough,
    Obama says that Muslims are \"deserving of respect and dignity.\" What he has
    never done is what Singer called for in Poland: denounce the attacks themselves
    as racist propaganda, in this case against Muslims. \"\r\nhttp://www.thenation.com/doc/20080317/klein"

  content: "Sepoy, \r\nWell-written open letter :-)\r\n\r\nObama isn't using the inflammatory
    rhetoric of the crusader president in foreign policy matters pertaining to the
    \"Muslim World.&rdquo; and that kind of tone will have a positive effect
    on matters regarding Muslim Americans. However, will he directly address the matters
    of the Muslims at home is the golden question. \r\n\r\n\"Is it easier for the
    American administration to reach out to the &ldquo;Muslim world&rdquo;
    than it is to deal with Muslims in America?\" http://www.agenceglobal.com/Article.asp?Id=1963
    \r\n\r\n\"Bringing it all back home: Obama's efforts to repair relations with
    Muslims abroad are admirable. But what about those living in the US?\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/apr/09/barack-obama-islam-muslims-us\r\n\r\nBtw,
    I noticed your use of the term \"Islamicate\". I think, it was Marshall Hodgson
    who coined this appropriate and inclusive term. I know that some people like Carl
    Ernst use it but by and large it is still the \"Muslim world\" or the \"Islamic
    world.\" Do you think that it will ever catch on, at least with \"experts\" or
    intellectuals? I have by and large resigned myself to using imprecise terms like
    the Middle-East (and the less ambiguous term - Muslim world), which can pretty
    much mean whatever one wants it to mean and includes whichever country one wants
    it to include."
