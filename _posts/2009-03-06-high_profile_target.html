  content: "*TEARS* for the innocent people and the shrines. I always assumed that
    no matter what happens in Pakistan, the shrines and cricket would be safe.  I'll
    pull all my hair out and wear white forever if they touch the shrines of Bahu,
    Bulleh or Waris (okay, I'm exaggerating, but I'll still feel like doing that!)  Is
    it possible that the Taliban were motivated by recent reports by the RAND corporation
    about supporting Desi Sufi Islam to counter Taliban and other extremist movements?
    A sort of pre-emptive strike to make sure they remain powerful? (really I don't
    even know what this means, aren't the Chishti's and Deobandi's Sufi's too? Hasn't
    Sufi thought influenced almost all Muslim theology to some extent in South Asia
    regardless of sect/adherence?) Plus, some of these shrines are really powerful
    and wealthy institutions (I'm thinking of the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar),
    so maybe the Taliban just wanted to loot them (not surprised). On the other hand,
    they say its because women visited there. Whats your take sepoy?"

  content: Also, thanks for the translation of Baba Rehmans poem. I've always wondered
    about Pashto poetry, being more familiar with Punjabi and Urdu myself, and I'm
    glad I finally know where to look for starters.

    a more serious note, where is the popular outrage? After every atrocity, I hope
    against hope that people will shout \"enough\", storm the nearest mosque popular

    a bit too much, but again... where is the popular outrage?"

    talking about Pakistan is the drug mafia. The Taliban elements of the north west
    have certain alternative means of funding, now that they have become more tolerant
    of the poppy cultivators. The international illegal drug trade is worth 8 billion
    dollars, and most of the illegal poppies come from the frontier areas of Afghanistan
    and Pakistan.   The global drug mafia has no organized presence to carry
    out a wholesome war, but it can very much inflict terrorist attacks and hold a
    country for ransom. This has happened in Mexico, Colombia and certain other South
    American countries in the past. To prevent his extradition to the USA, a drug
    mafia-lord in Colombia has conducted a series of regular bomb explosions to terrorize
    the population.   The way these fundamentalists in NWFP of Pakistan inflict
    terror : murdering artists, politicians and bombing girls schools, and most pertinently
    : murdering journalists who are taking a neutral position and are just providing
    a coverage of events : indicate they have links to the underworld. Some of the
    acts of these fundamentalists are even against hardline Islam : <b>digging up
    graves and hoisting the dead-bodies in public is not in Islamic custom.  However,
    such gruesome acts were done by the drug mafia to terrorize the locals in other
    areas of the world. </b></i>"

<p><a href="http://www.rahmanbabadiwan.com/index.htm">Rahman Baba</a> (~1650-1715) is perhaps the most beloved folk poet and sufi of the Pashtu speaking world. He is one star among the pantheon of Sindhi, Punjabi, Saraiki, Balochi and Pashto poets of the early modern (Shah Latif Bhitai, Sachal Sarmast, Waris Shah, Sultan Baho, Bulleh Shah etc). Writing in vernacular, but drawing extensively on Arabic and Persian poetics, Rahman offered a critical look at the 'orthodoxy' and his verses strive for a world (standard for Sufis) of abandonment toward God and dedication towards the fellow humans. <i>Rather than the unacceptable worship of the hypocrite, I prefer to be drunk on Saqi's wine.</i> His verses are frequently seen transcribed on trucks, rickshaws - or, just his name, imbibing the vehicle with his grace. His kalam is easily <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh7PP05v7yg">heard</a> around the country. His tomb, on the outskirts of Peshawar, is a frequent gathering place. </p>
<p>Major H. G. Raverty's <i>Selections from the Poetry of the Afghans, from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century, Literally translated from the Original Pushto; with Notices of the Different Authors, and Remarks on the Mystic Doctrine and Poetry of the Sufis</i> (1867) begins with a chapter on Rahman Baba (or Mulla Abd-ur-Rahman, as Raverty calls him)</p>
<blockquote><p>[Rahman Baba] is one of the most popular, and probably the best known, of all the Afghan poets. His effusions are of a religious or moral character, and chiefly on the subject of divine love, being, like the poetical compositions of all Muhammadan poets, tinged with the mysticisms of Sufi-ism, already described in the Introductory Remarks; but there is a fiery energy in his style, and a natural simplicity, which will be vainly sought for amongst the more flowery and bombastic poetry of the Persians...after a time, when the gift of poesy was bestowed upon him, he became a strict recluse, and was generally found by his friends in tears. Indeed, he is said to have been in the habit of weeping so much, as in course of time to have produced wounds on both his cheeks. His strict retirement, however, gave opportunity to a number of envious Mullas to belie him; and they began to circulate reports to the effect, that Rahman had turned atheist or heretic, since he never left his dwelling, and had even given up worshipping at the mosque along with the congregation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a matter strictly enjoined on all orthodox Muhammadans. At length, by the advice and assistance of some of the priesthood, more liberal and less bigoted than his enemies, he contrived to escape from their hands, by agreeing, for the future, to attend the place of public worship, and to pray aud perform his other religious duties, along with the members of the congregation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here is Raverty's translation of a very popular Rahman Baba verse</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>If I say aught regarding separation, what shall I say?<br />
0f this agony, without a remedy, what shall I say?</p>
<p>I have no power to breathe in the dear one's presence :<br />
Since I have no power, powerless, what shall I say? </p>
<p>When I gaze upon her, I forget myself entirely&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
When I know nothing of myself, what then shall I say? </p>
<p>Of the state of my own heart, unto her I cannot speak&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
Of that, without name or vestige, what shall I say? </p>
<p>Of love's mystery, that hitherto no one hath explained&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
Of the inexplicable and indescribable, what shall I say?</p>
<p>I am o'erwhelm'd in tears, through grief for my beloved&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
Concerning such a flood as this, what then shall I say? </p>
<p>I, who have sunk down upon the furnace of separation&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
Of the rose-bower of conjunction, what shall I say? </p>
<p>She plundereth one of life and goods, and stealeth the heart&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
Regarding such a heart-ravisher, what then shall I say? </p>
<p>She is still far better than all that I can explain&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<br />
What then of the loved-one shall I, Rahman, say?* </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, his tomb was <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=20760">badly damaged</a> by a bomb. The claimants being the Taliban - of Pakistan or of Afghanistan or of Mars. The impulse to bomb shrines is certainly Wahabi. They prove, again and again, that they are ruthless in their militancy. But those guns will run out of ammo, one day. <i>Chand ko gul karaiN, to hum janaiN.</i></p>
<p>In the meantime, the intelligentsia of Pakistan best stop fucking around with conspiracy theories. Pardon my fucking Urdu.</p>
