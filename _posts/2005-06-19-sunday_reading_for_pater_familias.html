    Thanks for the link to Mishra's new article.  He writes, I read.

    And warm congrats to East Bengal.  Now they know how we Liverpool fans feel.

    Cheers.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/sunday.jpg">Love, hugs and kisses to abba gee on this Father's Day. the weather is nice today but it is supposed to REALLY heat up this week. Ugh. Next weekend, the iowocity crew is coming to town [hopefully], so I am psyching up for it. Anyways, off to the links, eh?</p>
<ul>
<li>Prithvi called to attention an <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1143126.cms">op-ed</a> by Ashis Nandy in thursday's <i>TOI</i> called <i>Shifting Sand of History</i> on the Advani/Jinnah controversy. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,1508063,00.html">Here</a> is the best summary/background of the whole incident that I can find. As always, Nandy is provocative and thought-provoking. Though, when he wants us, " to move beyond history, indeed, ..., to defy history", I think he means "historical narratives" - which aren't as monolithic as he gives them credit. Anyways, there is tons to think over and mull in a simple op-ed.
<li>When Pankaj Mishra <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n12/mish01_.html">writes</a>, I read. In the <i>The 'People's War'</i>, <i>LRB</i>, he points out that, "Histories of South Asia rarely describe Nepal, except as a recipient of religions and ideologies &Atilde;&plusmn; Buddhism, Hinduism, Communism &Atilde;&plusmn; from India; even today, the countryís 60 ethnic and caste communities are regarded as little more than a picturesque backdrop to some of the worldís highest mountains. This is partly because Western imperialists overlooked Nepal when they radically remade Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries." A must read.
<li>In <i>The Independent</i>, is the <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/features/story.jsp?story=647304">Second Coming of Sartre</a>. "Hell is other people." Yeah.
<li>In the <i>NYT</i> is news of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/arts/music/19sont.html?ei=5088&en=ba25fe0ed7c11a5e&ex=1276833600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">MTV-Desi</a>. MTV [and hybrids] are so 90s. If MTV really wants to get the edge, how about <i>Real World: Lahore</i>? A Jama'ti straight from a madrasa, a KC party-girl, a LUMS over-achiever, a closeted NCA, the daughter of commissioner, a punjabi zamindar, a sindhi vadeera. When things get real, indeed.
<li><a href="http://www.1421exhibition.com/">1421</a>: Singapore's 600th Anniversary <a href="http://www.visitsingapore-zhenghe.com/index.php">Celebration</a> of Zheng He's "discovery of the world". Special discounts for sceptics.
<li>Finally, from <i>Boston Globe</i>, what drums did you <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/06/19/daddy_what_did_you_do_in_the_mens_movement/?page=full">beat</a>?
<li>Also finally, go see the perfect father's day <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/batmanbegins">movie</a>.
<li>Also, also finally, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4108028.stm">THIS</a> is unbelievable. Someone cast the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4098556.stm">movie</a>.
</ul>
<p><b>update:</b>I couldn't find the link yesterday to Peter Bergen's <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20050620&s=bergen">review</a> of <i>The Power of Nightmares</i>.</p>
