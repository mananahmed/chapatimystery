  content: I get all my news from Pat Oliphant, and, according to him, <a href="http://www.ucomics.com/patoliphant/2005/07/26/"
    rel="nofollow">there are no condemnations of jihadist terror coming from above</a>.
    So I don't get your point.

    firstly--a rather passionate post. i will also add that this association of terrorism with islam has psychologically crippled Muslims. I remember 9/11 in high school. Following the attacks, I started distancing myself from Islam out of my ignorance. It was later when I read Fanon, that I was able to reconcile myself with the reality of being Muslim, separated from the rhetoric.
    Brilliant, btw. I have become a fan :-)

  content: I do feel a bit sheepish about my "passion". This blog has been under a
    "No Snark" policy for a few months. Mr. Adesnik just caught me in a weak moment.
    And I have no formal relation with Iowa but I killed many hours, and brain cells,
    there with some literary geniuses.

  content: You know, I am kind of proud of America in that it doesn't seem to have
    that many homocidal Salafis among its Islamic population, especially when compared
    to Europe.  This is not patronizing or orientalizing, but rather admiration of
    a system that seems to not produce people desirous of killing their fellow citizens
    in wholesale lots (though obviously a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh"
    rel="nofollow">slip through the cracks</a>). <p>While it's fairly obvious that
    no one takes Irshad Manji seriously (except for Western unbelievers), there's
    the kernel of a good point in there.</p>

    We aren't going to "do our part" as American muslims by rejecting our faith. We can "do our part" by living as good citizens as we have always done, and continue to protect our traditions and culture from all assaults - internal and external alike.

<p>Not that I am interested in bashing David Adesnik, but the man writes some serious inanities. In his latest <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/2005_07_31_oxblog_archive.html#112296772583266680">post</a> - sticking up for Irshad Manji - he concludes: "Wouldn't it be curious if American Muslims became the driving force behind the anti-terrorist movement in the Islamic world? These days, Americans talk more and more about exporting democracy to the Middle East. But who ever thought that Americans would also be exporting a new and more enlightened brand of Islam to the Muslim world?". What hubris!</p>
<p>Are the Muslim Americans part of some "other", so much "better" Muslim world? Are these "American" Muslims so distinct from the "world" Muslims? Did they not _come_ from that other Muslim world? And what exactly are they "exporting"? Imams? Self-flagellating Mujahids? Care Packages [ahem]? Are the many, many <a href="http://www.muhajabah.com/otherscondemn.php">condemnations</a> of jihadists [also <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~kurzman/terror.htm">this</a>, via J. Cole] by "those" Muslims in that there Muslim world awaiting <b>American Muslim</b> legitimization? Or just David Adesnik legitimization?</p>
<p>What is this fetishization of quotes and press releases condemning terrorism by those Muslims? Why is it so important to segment the faith and those who practice it or look like they might practice it or seem like they should practice it? What rhetorical and argumentative role is being played when the media eggheads ask, nay demand, that every Muslim be asked and tell how severely they condemn terrorism, how sorry they are that <i>Islam led them to this place? </i></p>
<p>Is it because the scribbled-in-Arabic-and-fossilized-in-seventh-century Islam allows the media the incomprehensible <i>other</i> they can safely point to <i>over there</i>? Orientalism redux? Yes, AlQaeda uses Qur'anic quotes to solicit and justify heinous acts. So, let's say we take ALL offending quotes out of the Qur'an. What then? AlQaeda recruitment ends? No one will strap a bomb on because SUDDENLY they will figure out that they will get 70 white raisins and not seventy virgins? Are you kidding me? </p>
<p>Is all this really that hard to understand? Most recent terrorists are Muslim. Most recent terrorist belong to a certain social class that allows them freedom of movement and travel. Most recent terrorists are male. Most recent terrorists are members of organization involved, pretty vocally, in anti-Zionist or anti-imperialist actions. Most recent terrorists like blue jeans. Is it possible that we can look at the whole matrix of commonalities - perhaps some that cut across race and religion? Is it possible that there is more to this story than Islam - a faith of BILLIONS - ALL of whom do not appear to be in armed revolt against America or hedonism? </p>
<p>I will say it again. Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is not a religion of war. Islam is not this or that and here or there. Islam is a living tradition with a complex history of fourteen centuries. Islam did not stop evolving in the 7th century. It actually has a history of transformations - grave transformations. It has a history of secessions and renewals and new modalities. Start <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226346854/qid=1123026637/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8027709-1872645?v=glance&s=books">here</a> and work back. I condemn terrorism with all of my rational, moral and ethical being. I do not need to be a Muslim to do it. I just need to be a human. The jihadists are waging <b>a political war</b>. They do not need to be Muslims to do it. They just need to believe in their own twisted cause.</p>
