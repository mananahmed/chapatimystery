    only copies of the movie available would be pirated!   I've heard blogger

  content: That's odd.  I would think that a Muslim nation would be thrilled with
    a film that sets out to diminish the divinity of Jesus.  After all, a Jesus who
    is only a great moral teacher is much more in light with the religious climate
    of Pakistan than that a belief in the Trinity.

    @Andrew Reeves: FYI, Muslims have great respect for Jesus <i>and</i> Mary. See http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/nabi.html#mary.



    The Pakistani blasphemy laws cover punishment for blasphemy against any of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.

<p><a href="http://www.dawn.com/2006/06/05/top18.htm">Dawn</a> reports that Pakistan Govt. has decided that "screening of the film [DaVinci Code], or possession of it on video cassettes or discs, was prohibited and unlawful" because it is "sacrilegious to all religions". Apparently, there have been <a href="http://www.pakistanchristianpost.com/newsviewsdetails.php?newsid=543">protests</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5045672.stm">demonstrations</a>...though, I haven't really seen anything in the Urdu press about it...and now <a href="http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2006-06/05/06.shtml">everyone is happy</a>!! Don't forget <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C05%5Cstory_5-6-2006_pg11_3">the book</a>!</p>
<p>Save us, Haysuess. </p>
