  content: "I am extremely happy that finally Ashk would be read in English through
    your long commitment and hard work. Depending upon the success of the collection
    of his short stories, it would be quite appropriate to bring out an English translation
    of his best known novel &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Garam Raakh&acirc;&euro;\x9D. It has
    all the ingredient of a story well told in the background of pre-independent Lahore
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the centre of literary activities of northern India and of
    the people who ran and manipulated the cultural activities and their idiosyncrasies."

<p>About seventeen years ago, I started a project translating a collection of the Hindi author Upendranath Ashk's short stories. The project has had a checkered career but is finally coming to fruition in March 2013 from Penguin India. The collection will be called Hats and Doctors, and two excerpts are now available online, one from <a href="http://www.caravanmagazine.in/fiction/hats-and-doctors">Caravan</a>, and one from <a href="http://pratilipi.in/2013/01/upendranath-ashk-story/">Pratilipi</a>. (the image is a brilliant illustration for the short story "Hats and Doctors," published in <em><a href="http://www.caravanmagazine.in/fiction/hats-and-doctors">Caravan</a></em></p>
