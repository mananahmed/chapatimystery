  content: "Hi, first, happy birthday. I came across your blog thru amardeep singh's
    which i read from time to time. i'm a grad student at harvard working on south
    asian history- more specifically, how school history textbooks reflect changing
    notions of national identities in the subcontinent (and the controversies therein).
    i'd be very interested to know if you've done any work on how mohammad bin qasim
    is viewed in pakistani textbooks, and i'd be interested in your thoughts on pakistani
    nationalism and nation hood in general. since this post contains my email id,
    i'd be grateful if you could email your contact details (if that's okay with you)
    so I could pester you with some more questions about ur research. \nregards,\nantara
    datta"

  content: "You guys are making me feel too good for breathing. Thanks a whole, whole
    bunch. All of you have been very kind in reading the blog, mentioning me on your
    sites and being involved in my conversations. So, cheers to all of you.  Antara:
    I have a whole chapter on Muhammad b Qasim and pakistani textbooks (one of the
    written ones, in fact, not the imaginary kind). So, I will be happy to discuss
    anything re: that. As to my thoughts on pakistani nationalism, they are scattered
    around here (mostly in the homistan category). more later and soon."

<p><img src="/img/bday.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>September 22 is a good birthday to have, I think. Frodo and Bilbo Baggins share it with me. Also Ronaldo. It is the last day of the summer. Last day of the Eleusinian rituals of rebirth. I hate my birthdays. Its not the getting old part, its the "taking stock of life" part. It is torture really.<br />
This one is off to a good start. Drove to Madison with sven last night to see the <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">Decemberists</a> at Limey's Pizza. Ok, maybe not at limey's pizza but nice name, no? The show was really good. Colin is maturing as a performer. He actually bantered as opposed to the usual: this song is about a dead girl / this song is about a turkish prostitute / this song is about an architect. Though he still did that. This is my third show for them and that is extraordinary for me. Good band, I guess. After the show, I got to talk to them for a small bit. New album in March called <i>picaresque</i>. Look forward to that.<br />
On the way back, a speeding ticket.<br />
Hey! it's all good. Going to see <i>Sky Captain</i> and get some sleep tonight. Thanks for the kind wishes from friends real and virtual. And my dad send a great email which made my day. He is a cool dad.<br />
<b>update</b>: I am def. NOT feeling better now. Someone broke into my car today and stole my iPod and digicamera in broad daylight! Bunch of savages in this town. I curse thee with the power of a thousand suns.</p>
