  content: Null, the whisky glass test is sensitive but not specific (and only applies
    to Muslims; if your religion does not enforce prohibition then this test is irrelevant).
    That means that if a Muslim friend does NOT look askance at your whisky glass,
    then he is not a jihadi but if he does look askance, then he COULD be a jihadi.
    The test has too many false positives in the case of women and should only be
    applied to young muslim males (who are the demographic most likely to explode,
    so that objection does not nullify the test)....hope that clears things up.

  content: "Omar; dude congratulations for the piece in outlinkindia.com asmentioned
    above. To me  though CM is the ultimate form when talking about homistan(off course
    I am biased). Not that I want to rain on your parade but do you seriously think
    that this guy was trying to revive Caliphate  with the help of 3 Propane cylinders,
    firecrackers and non-combustible fertilizer while his personal life was unravelling.\r\nAs
    \ physicians  could we  not broaden the  differential diagnosis to include;\r\n\r\n1)May
    be this guy has gone over the deep end\r\n\r\n\"This is somebody who left the
    keys to his apartment in the ignition of the would-be car bomb, and had to call
    his landlord to be let into his Connecticut digs. He spent all of a month planning
    the attack, and used the wrong kind of fertilizer for his bomb &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    the device could never have gone off. So much for all that \"training\" he supposedly
    received from the Pakistani Taliban. And one little detail does stand out, amid
    all the leakage coming out of law enforcement circles. According to Newsweek,
    when federal agents boarded his Emirates flight to Dubai on the runway at JFK
    airport, Shahzad said: \r\n\r\n\"I was expecting you. Are you NYPD or FBI?\" \"\r\n\r\nhttp://original.antiwar.com/justin/2010/05/06/is-faisal-shahzad-crazy/\r\n\r\nOr
    2) May be he is a useful idiot\r\n\r\n\"In an extraordinarily open and transparent
    recruitment drive, Dennis Blair, who as director of National Intelligence is the
    country's top intelligence czar, held a round-table discussion last week with
    the Pakistani-American community in Washington to seek their cooperation and offer
    jobs in US agencies. \r\n\r\n\"We need you to help us build a better relationship
    between the United States and Pakistan,\" Blair told some two dozen Pakistani-Americans
    who came to the meeting. Citing a common threat faced by both nations, Blair said
    Pakistan is an important US ally in the fight against terrorists and violent extremists,
    but \"understanding needs to be improved on both sides and Pakistani-Americans
    can help bridge the gaps\". \r\n\r\nTheir language skills and cultural expertise
    would make them extremely valuable professionals in the Intelligence Community,
    he added. \r\n\r\nThe roundtable discussion was the first of its kind under the
    umbrella of the Intelligence Community Heritage Liaison Council, which is a sounding
    board for Blair on recruiting first- and second-generation Americans for employment
    in US intelligence agencies, his office said in a statement. The Office of the
    Directorate of National Intelligence, headed by Blair, oversees 16 federal organizations
    that make up the US Intelligence Community, including CIA and FBI among others.
    \r\n\r\nWhat was remarkable about the outreach meeting was the presence there
    of Pakistani ambassador to the US, Hussain Haqqani, amid strong resentment in
    Pakistan about the activities of the US intelligence agencies there and the uneasy
    relationship between the CIA and the ISI in the Af-Pak theater. \r\n\r\nFar from
    being shifty or secretive, the statement from Blair's office suggested the Pakistani-American
    participants were quite gung-ho about cooperating with US intelligence agencies.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/Once-bitten-US-still-seeks-Pak-American-spies/articleshow/5493369.cms\r\n\r\n3)May
    be we do not know the whole story yet?\r\nHere is Steve coll\r\n\r\n\"WERMAN:
    Tell us how someone like Faisal Shahzad, an American citizen with family connections
    in the Pakistani military apparently, he turns up in a place like Peshawar for
    bomb making training.  How would he have been received by jihadis?\r\n\r\nCOLL:
    Well he probably would have been assessed as a potential U.S. spy, carrying a
    U.S. passport and not necessarily having deep connections to the jihadi movement,
    so there would most likely have been an air of caution around his claims as a
    volunteer.  What you can see, circumstantially, is something that has definitely
    occurred in other cases like his where the jihadi groups say to a new arrival
    of that type, much as a street gang might say to a 14-year-old volunteer, oh you
    really want to play in the big time?  Well go do something and then come back.
    \ Go bring me the broom of the wicked witch of the west.  I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    fully trust you, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not going to take you into our headquarters
    and reveal anything that you could betray, but if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re here
    to tell me that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re truly a volunteer, then here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    an opportunity. Go back to your country and do something, then we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll
    know you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re for real.  That is give him enough to do some damage,
    but not enough to damage you in terms of information about your own operations.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theworld.org/2010/05/05/times-square-suspect/\r\n\r\n4)
    Let us say media and government Annonymous sources are telling the whole truth,
    then some well informed people have the following take;\r\n\r\n\"What do we know
    about the drama of the SUV? It was spotted burning, the fire was put out, propane
    tanks, fireworks and fertilizer were ominously packed inside, and the owner was
    arrested as he was about to fly off to Dubai. Certainly these are suggestive and
    even alarming facts. But little more is known about the suspect, an American citizen
    born in Pakistan, or his actions.\r\n\r\nWithin hours, however, purported details
    attached to this incident spewed out like ash from a hyperactive crater. Faisal
    Shahzad, the 30-year-old suspect, received terrorist training in Waziristan; he
    was in league with Taliban groups in Pakistan; he had met with radical Taliban
    leaders; his father was friendly with Pakistani radicals; he was angered by deaths
    of militants killed by U.S. drones operating over Pakistani territory; he was
    coached by Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born imam targeted for assassination
    by the Obama administration; he was captured in the nick of time by secret military
    spy planes scooping up cell phone calls over New York City; his wife&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    relatives lived in the same Colorado town where Najibullah Zazi, the would-be
    subway bomber, lived. All of this supposed information, dripping with conspiracy
    and 21st century terror, was leaked by anonymous investigators or federal officials
    to newspaper and broadcast reporters here and abroad.\r\n\r\nHow do these alleged
    links and facts hold up to what is actually known? If nothing else, questions
    should abound about the quality of terrorist training going on in Waziristan.
    If Shahzad created a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;car bomb&acirc;&euro;\x9D he was profoundly
    inept. He packed away fertilizer that does not explode and he sought to ignite
    it with firecrackers designed not to detonate each other. The tanks of propane
    gas did not have their caps removed, rendering them useless as explosives....\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.juancole.com\r\n\r\nand
    here\r\n\r\n\"And then there's the question of why he tried to do this. Based
    on the still-sketchy information I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve read so far, it seems
    likely that he wanted to kill Americans in New York City because he didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    like our killing people in Central Asia. (Most of our victims are suspected terrorists,
    but we sometimes kill innocent civilians by mistake). Whether he was acting alone
    or in cahoots with Pakistani extremists, his abortive attack was probably a response
    to our efforts to eradicate terrorist groups in Pakistan via drone strikes and
    other special operations. In short, he decided to enlist in the \"war on terror,\"
    but not on America's side.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://walt.foreignpolicy.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    speed with which all the information about alleged attacker,  his colloboration
    with now dead, now alive Hakkem ullah Mehsud, getting instructions from Mullah
    Bradar and our Sec. of State, reading riot acts to Pakistan, makes this ongoing
    saga very interesting to say the least."

  content: "Salman, \r\nOf course I was joking about the \"kicked off the airwaves\"
    part. \r\nAkbar, Thank you for aggregating all the conspiracy theories in one
    place. Personally, I am sticking with the NYPD's version in this case. \r\nBut
    this is a liberal blog, you are free to pick any theory you like, or even better,
    not pick one and list all of them and invite people to ponder.\r\nOR, you could
    interact with a lot of the young men I grew up with and still communicate with
    liberal blogs are not my only hangout). It helps to narrow things down (in this
    case, not in all cases) to Islamist or dupe, both of which are fully compatible
    with my theory of \"Islamist moron\" (not saying all islamists are morons, some
    are actually very very smart).....\r\nAnyway, people who deny that Pakistan is
    illiberal are implicitly saying that its good to be liberal. As liberals, how
    can we not approve of that? And if someone is against colonialism, imperialism,
    islamism,  nationalism, essentialism, orientalism and fascism and  prefers to
    take this opportunity to bash the American establishment, why not? Its all good.
    We are on the same side, even when we argue. In fact, especially when we argue."

    thinker like Wright,  is not obvious on moral grounds. It depends. Do they do
    more harm than good?  He thinks they do more harm than good. Other people disagree.
    But in his world, this is an emprical argument and in principle, he could be FOR
    drone attacks if the evidence shows more benefit than harm. I would keep that
    in mind before getting too close to hazrat Wright.'
