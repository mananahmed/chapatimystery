  content: "You know, a while back, <i>Mother Jones</i> had an article about Christian
    groups sending people into Islamic countries with the sinister goal of \"wiping
    out Islam.\"  Upon actually reading the article, it turns out that they were missionaries
    trying to convert Muslims to Christianity. <p>That Tribune article likewise
    shows that basically irreligious people are utterly clueless when it comes to
    dealing with a proselytizing faith like Islam or Christianity.  In the case of
    the <i>Mother Jones</i> article, you see people trying to understand Muslims as
    oppressed people of color rather than practitioners of a religion.  Likewise,
    while \"Islamic State in America\" may sound creepy, that whole conversion of
    unbelievers thing is what Islam is about.   <p>Out of curiosity, when teaching
    on subjects that run into religious/pre-modern mindsets, how often do you find
    that your undergrads wind up Not Getting It?</p></p>"

  content: 'Andrew: I will have an answer to your question by Monday when my first
    writing assignments is due. I asked them to historicize and contextualize a "religious"
    event. Lets see what they get. I will keep you posted.'

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg" align=left hspace=22 vspace=6>A few things that caught my eye, I submit for your consideration. Now, I am going to go enjoy that late September sun.</p>
<ul>
<li>From Chicago Tribune [r.r.] comes a rather alarmist report on the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-0409190261sep19,1,3910166.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Muslim Brotherhood</a>. The <i>Ikhwan</i> have not had much ink spilled on them in the US media. Here is their sinister goal in America - convert Christians to Islam.
<li>From Express India, comes the rallying cry of K S Sudarshan who wants  Hindus to have more children (to counteract the breeding Muslims) and  expose the <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=36218&headline=America~is~India's~worst~enemy:~RSS">aims of CIA in India</a> - convert Hindus to Christianity.
<li>From the Guardian, comes a <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,1307092,00.html">review</a> of Mark Mazower's <i>Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950</i> by Jan Morris that recalls a time when conversion wasn't all that sinister - or hot.
<li>In Daily Times Lahore, Khaled Ahmed <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_19-9-2004_pg3_4">writes</a> about this whole virgin-raisin "controversy" among the believers. He is referring to this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,,631332,00.html">review</a> by Ibn Warraq. Do you really believe these murderers kill for virgins?
<li>In the LRB, Andrew O'Hagan writes about the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n18/print/ohag01_.html">God Squad</a> at the RNC. He finds "manifest destiny" in NY. Ouch.
<li>Not be outdone, is Alan Wolfe in the Boston Globe. He writes about the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n18/print/ohag01_.html">God gap</a> at the DNC. He thinks religion was the white elephant in the Fleet Center.
<li>Moacir went ahead and <a href="http://www.1984produkts.com/donkeyhottie/wordpress/archives/2004/09/19/in_lieu_of_watching_meet_the_press_this_morning/">read Hunter S. Thompson</a> and reminded me to continue to believe that they are wrong for this country and this world.
<li>In the meantime, all I have to do is believe that the Pakistanis will take the Champions Trophy, oh babay! They did right to India <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/3670542.stm">today</a>. Next up, the W. Indies.
</ul>
