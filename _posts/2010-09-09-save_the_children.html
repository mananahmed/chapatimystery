  content: "come on professor.  You got to be kidding me.  I have seen this kind of
    \r\nsentiment in other pakistani blogs that success of India is very bad for pakistan.\r\n\r\nThis
    comes from the fact that Pakistani believe they were wrongly thrown out\r\nof
    India by conspiracy of WhiteMan and Hindus.  That god gave this.  THis\r\nis the
    mission of Pakistan.  This is the Political interest of Pakistan.\r\nThis is the
    same kind of thinking plagues the rest of muslims, if only\r\nMongols hadn't destroyed
    their perfect empire, we would still rule the world.\r\nVery weak thinking.\r\n\r\nOr
    how about this.\r\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/article/anarchic-republic-pakistan-3917\r\nOnly
    if a liberal technocrat would take over Pakistan and Islamist\r\nand Right wing
    just give up power then everything will be alright\r\nwith Pakistan.  Standard
    clap trap aimed at liberals."

<p>I have a piece up in <em>Express Tribune</em>, '<a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/48125/'if-you-have-understanding-then-why-this-hubbub'/">If you have understanding, then why this hubhub?</a>', Sep 9th, 2010, in reference to, <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/47274/punjab-govt-goes-after-hindu-mythology-cartoons/">Punjab govt goes after Hindu mythology cartoons</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The politicians are afraid, I assume, that watching the Amar Chitra Katha cartoons — which depict stories from the Mahabharata or Ramayana or Jataka or Panchatantra — will turn impressionable Punjabi Muslim children into Hindus. I would reassure the politicians — the Panchatantra tales were translated into Arabic and distributed in the late seventh century as Kalila wa Dimna, for the edification of courtly children, and failed to make the Umayyad or the 'Abbasid or the Buyid sultans Hindu. Subsequent translations and re-imaginings of Ramayana, of Yogavashistha in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth century Mughal courts were also done without the fear that exposing innocent Muslim children to these narratives will make them &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; — leaving aside the glaring logical fallacy that mere knowledge about the stories and rituals associated with a faith makes one a convert. That this statement is being made on Punjabi soil, however, is one of those ironies that make you cry.</p>
<p>Punjab, after all, is the land of Shah Hussain, Bulleh Shah and Waris Shah — mystics whose poetry, lives, ethos were drenched in divine, both lil-lah and Krishna. Their kafi and their qissa drew equally on Perso-Islamic and Sanskritic mythologies, stories, folk-tales to illuminate daily lives, teach love, moderation and acceptance. The love of Shah Hussain and Madho Lal is itself legend. Their words and verses are, undoubtedly, the very definition of &ldquo;Punjabi&rdquo;, and there they stand, historically &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; in the views of Punjab politicians with &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; signs, symbols, stories and themes, corrupting Punjabi children for nearly 400 years.</p></blockquote>
