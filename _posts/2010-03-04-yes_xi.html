  content: An exceptional post! Thinking to myself that this is the sort of fodder
    that conservatives in America need to fuel their confirmation biases. No American
    passport or birth certificate would stand a chance against this revelation!

<p>Since moving to Berlin, I haven't watched any Fox or gone to political websites or kept up with all that stuff. Guido keeps me up. Check this, though. Huma Imtiaz and Rahma are twittering across Sindh/Punjab and beyond (follow them <a href="http://twitter.com/Rahma">here</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/HumaImtiaz">here</a>) and snapped this at a bazaar in Multan.</p>
<p><a href="http://tweetphoto.com/13198072"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/03/x2_c962f8.jpeg" alt="" title="Obama&#039;s Pakistani National I.D. Card" width="528" height="411" class="size-full wp-image-4802" /></a> </p>
<p>The reason it makes it a worthy induction into the Yes! series is that the entry for "Distinguishing Marks" reads <em>Aasteen ka Sanp</em> - literally the snake which lives in one's sleeve. An idiomatic phrase, this is a contraction of <em>Aasteen mein Sanp palna</em> - to nurture snakes in one's sleeve - meaning to keep one's enemies at really close quarters. As Mushafi (1748-1824) said, Daytah hai apnay dil mein us zulf ko jo jahGah/Goya kay Aasteen mein wo sanp palta hai - Whoever gives that (curling, maybe) Lock (of hair) a place in his/her heart; It is as if he/she grows a snake in his/her sleeve. Wow, that is the least effort I have ever made in a translation.</p>
<p>So, Obama then, in Multan, is a snake, hiding in someone's sleeve (Zardari?). Brilliant.</p>
