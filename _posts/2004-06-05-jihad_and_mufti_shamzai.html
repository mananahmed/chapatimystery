  content: "Dear Sepoy,  I witnessed a very interesting drama on Mufti Sahab's
    death in Karachi. It was staged by Muttahida Majlis e Amal. The Mullahs tried
    to blame MQM (another local ethnic political party) they also tried to blame establishment
    (even though they have always being considered the part of establishment by many
    Pakistanis) and then they tried to blame the entire Kafir world for killing Mufti
    Sahab. An article from the daily Ummat would give you a lil different view about
    how Mufti's death was utilized in Karachie and how riots were organized not to
    support the Jihadis but to destabilize the government in Sindh. If you browse
    the front page and other articles in this newspaper you would be surprized to
    find out the propaganda by the so called Islamic parties.  <a href=\"http://ummat.com.pk/ejazmangi31052004.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">http://ummat.com.pk/ejazmangi31052004.htm</a> the other day
    there was a bomb blast in a Imam Bargah and Majlis successfully hijacked the blast
    mixed it with Mufti sahab's death and staged the scene of fear and panic in the
    city. They called for a strike on Friday and the strike was more successful in
    Karachi than in NWFP.  The international Media was reporting the events as
    sectarian violence in the city which was absolutely wrong. The Jafria alliance
    held a press conference in Karachi on saturday where the told that during the
    funeral of blast's victims some police officers intentionally used language to
    create anger among the shia crowd. Jafria Alliance also told in the conference
    that the shia community was suprized over the violance. They demanded an investigation
    on the riots during the funeral. Local press was trying to show it as some
    conspiracy against Karachi's peace (Karachi never had peace since Zia ul haq planted
    Afghans and Pakhtun illegal immigrants in the city during the Afghan war).   I
    personally see it as an attempt to conquer the Country's economic backbone politically.
    Considering the huge number of Afghan immigrants, Jihadi's from every part of
    the country who come here to take refuge and the carelessness of federal government
    it is quite an easy job."

  content: "first of all people should think before saying to such a eminent personalities
    in such a derog. way  \"mullahs\".they should think onced that who they are.and
    how much they are following islam and how much they are sincere with thier religion. they
    must feel shame.such people can neither serve thier there religion nor they can
    be sincere with thier country. they just know how to support thier evil party
    MQM.an hostile party.who not only deface the reputation of mohajirs but also the
    name of pakistan. this is altaf hussain who said\"establishment of pakistan
    was an biggest blunder\" he said that in india. onced he also said that \"if
    i get authority i will ban the prayers of jumma and prayers of Eidain\". people
    who think he supports mohajir people they are wrong.he is not supporting mohajir
    people but he is USING mohajirs by involving them into his evil activities."

<p>I have been reading a lot about Mufti Shamzai ever since his assassination. My initial <a href="/archives/homistan/roosting_chickens.html"> post </a> was harshly critical of him and the jihadi program of his seminary. I wrongfully accused him of being sectarian. I apologize for that. Still, my initial assessment stands true: his teachings led, directly and indirectly, to sectarian and jihadi violence.<br />
Today's <i>Jang</i> Daily has an <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/jun2004-daily/05-06-2004/editorial/col7.htm">op-ed</a> written by Jawaid Chaudhry that really captures the political importance of this man of God and shows that even in his death, he is being utilized for the very cause that claimed his life. Jihad.  My translation follows....<br />
<b>update:</b>A heart-wrenching <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/000028.html">post</a>  on the riots that followed Mufti Shamzai's death can be found at Danial's blog [english translation is linked as well].<br />

<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif"><center><b>The Mujahideen Factory</b><br />
Jawaid Chaudhry<br />Saturday, June 5, 2004<br /></center></p>
<p>This happened in 2001; the world Trade Center had been destroyed, America was preparing to launch attacks on Afghanistan, Pakistan had become a no-cost defensive ally of America; at this delicate juncture, a revolt started in the Northern areas. The Shari'ah-enforcers came down from the mountains and took control of the Silk Highway from Chalas to Gilgit. They encamped in the middle of the highway. They had heavy weaponry and were ready to die. The situation was very delicate. The entire country was enveloped in American hatred. People had love of the Taliban in their hearts. In this conditions, if the Government mishandled the Shar'ah-enforcers, events could take a turn for the worse. The mini-revolt could flame out all over the country. There was lengthy discussion and brainstorming and everyone's eyes rose to the same one person. It was decided unanimously, if he agrees, then these people would go back to the mountains. The Government send some senior military officers to Karachi. They appeared before the gentleman and pleaded their case, "If those people do not release the Silk Highway, the very foundation of Pakistan will be endangered". Hazrat (His Honor) listened to this plea with utter calm, and thought for a little while, and asked for half-an-hour to decide. He came out after half-an-hour with a small briefcase in his hand and said, "I am ready. Tell me where to go." Hazrat arrived at the Silk Highway and pandemonium broke out, people started congregating around him. He started to explain things to them. He lived among them for one week. In those seven days, the tents started to come up and people started to leave for their homes. When he returned, the traffic was normal once again on the Silk Highway.</p>
<p>This was Hazrat Nizamuddin Shamzai. He was born in a small village in Sawat. From one small madrasa to another, he reached Banuri Town and revolutions started to happen from his teaching and preaching. The Taliban were his students. On that side of Khyber Pass, he was an icon. From Jalalabad to the Amu Darya River, he was the father of the Taliban. Whether the Taliban were in power or seeking it, they respected him above all. Mullah Omar was also a student. Before the American assault on Afghanistan, the Pakistani Government decided to reason with the Taliban. They were contacted but Mullah Omar was not prepared to meet with any Pakistani dignitaries. Once again, Hazrat Shamzai's help was sought. Mr. Shamzai went to Kandhar with Gen. Mahmood. Just as he showed up, Mullah Omar agreed to talk and sat and listened to the General with great concentration.</p>
<p>Hazrat Shamzai had three or four qualities that made him unique among other 'ulama. For example, he did not believe in the differences between Shi'a, Sunni, Ahl-Hadith, or Barelwi. He proclaimed, "Such differences will destroy the entire world of Islam." He wanted Muslims to unite. He had close ties with many Shi'a scholars. Whenever there was a terrorist attack in the country, whenever a Shi'a mosque or a congregation was attacked, he was the first religious scholar to publicly condemn it. He used to say, "No Muslim can fire upon another Muslim". He was a proponent of modernity. He thought that Media was the battleground of this new age, and the Enemy has been defeating the Muslim in this field for too long and we are stuck in 'Are pictoral representations legal or not?!'. For the last two months, he had been trying to get the scholars to debate  about Television. There had been several gatherings on the subject of Television. Mufti Shamzai thought, if the scholars can all agree, we will start a public t.v. channel for Islamic teachings. He was a man who carefully weighed everything. He was not agreeable to calling Muslims non-believers. One of our friend asked him, "Should prayer be read with hands folded or by the side?" He quietly replied, "Man should concentrate on prayer alone, not on hands and feet." And his greatest characteristic was Jihad. Though this became his tragic flaw which led to his death. He was in favor of Jihads all around the world. Whether it was in Palestine, Chechenya, Kashmir, or Afghanistan, he supported Jihad with his speech, his writings and his pockets. He used to say, "Jihad is the salvation for Muslims. If they left this, they will become slaves of the other nations". This thinking of his proved to be his greatest crime and he became an obstacle in the eyes of those organizations who want to stop Jihad in this world.</p>
<p>I remember quiet vividly the seminar on Jihad held two years ago at the Carnegie Institute in America. The experts there declared: "As long as the factories producing Mujhadeen are not closed, Jihad will not stop." Mufti Shamzai was one such factory. Everyone who reached his social circle, found in himself the desire for Jihad, the desire for self-annihilation. Thus, the "crime" of Mufti Shamzai was an unforgivable one and he was sentenced to death just like <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7995E32C-9686-40DA-97AD-2E0D5EABF6D1.htm">Ahmad Yasin</a>. He was also martyred.</p>
<p>The martyrdom of Mufti Shamzai is a tragedy for the entire Muslim world. Even more than a tragedy, it is a cause for alarm. It tells us that like Mufti Shamzai, all the erstwhile figures of the Islamic world are in danger. America and its pets are targeting the factories of Mujhadeen.  Hence, we have to protect our religion and our reliogiou leaders like Mufti Shamzai. <img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>When will this end?</p>
