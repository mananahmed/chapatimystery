Much earlier, as in 2012, I wrote a series of small things that were meant for a book that I was then planning and researching. My intention was to write a cult(ur)o-geography of Lahore, a riff on the psychogeographies of Guy Debord and friends. For a few years, then, I had been doing ethnographies and collecting ephemera around Lahore--print and visual materials, tapes, some objects. I had planned the book around a series of walks across bits of Lahore that I imagined as sponge-like, for their capacity to both be full and empty (I mean here meaning as well as people). My first walk was to begin, I remember writing it in my mind, from the vestibule of my house, through the main gate, across the agricultural land that stretched in front until the haphazard *mohalla* lanes with their open-sewer brackets, onto the main road that came to a sudden intersection colloquially called "joint". The crossroad here merged pathways from two different worlds--one was clean, organized, richer, the other dusty, jumbled and poorer. I would continue walking letting the dirt accumulate on my shoes, jumping over puddles of garbage, standing water, bricks, on a straight line that will eventually turn right, and lead me to Lahore Railway Station. It was not a long walk--it would to take me around two hours.

On a city level, this walk would traverse the British colonial Lahore, to the grand Railway station from the edge of their cantonment quarters keeping more or less parallel to the railway tracks that were speeding towards Amritsar. This was the first line of partition in Lahore, beginning in 1860s which sliced the city across colonial and colonized, Mughal and British. I cannot recall why I wanted to start with this walk.

I am eleven years removed from that writing and it is only now that I can pick up those threads and begin anew to write that book. I still carry some of the sentences I wrote then in my mind--you are welcome to revisit them here--<a href="https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/slow_burn_lahore_ii_meeting_old_masters.html">II</a>, <a href="https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/archives/homistan/slow_burn_lahore_iii_this_is_my_culture.html">III</a>, <a href="https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/slow_burn_lahore_iv_see_through_cement.html">IV</a>, <a href="https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/slow_burn_lahore_v_archeology_of_space.html">V</a>, <a href="https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/slow_burn_lahore_vi_a_footnote.html">VI</a>).
"Stretched across Lahore are stories of invisible beings and visible non-beings," I wrote.

Storytellers make the city and I need to make a new one now.
