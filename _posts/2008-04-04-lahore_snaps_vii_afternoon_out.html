  content: When I first looked at it I thought - the citizen, after having invoked
    the law, principles of civics, and basic decency, has just switched to one precious
    uncleji in a powerful position. The leader of the pack is still trying, but the
    others have realised that kuchh nahin hone waala, sab time waste saala, jaane
    do isko.

  content: Well, just come across this site today. I was at Cathedral from 1959-1962
    (long time ago!!). Anyone here from that time? I was back on a short visit in
    2005, going to the school again brought tears to my eyes -- the place has meant
    a lot to me over the years.

<p>There wasn't much time to visit anyone or any place. I saw maybe a fraction of Lahore, and that maybe on two trips. Even if I had time, I had little inclination to go places. I am a nostalgic guy but I hate nostalgia. You feel me? Not to mention that Lahore was cordoned off under the bomb threats.</p>
<p>I did partake in a tiny bit of nostalgia. I went by my high school, Cathedral High School.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2387579305/" title="Cathedral High School by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2289/2387579305_29071af41c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cathedral High School" /></a><br />
<!--more--><br />
I gazed forlornly at the ground where I played my very first cricket match (I was posted at third man boundary. I let the ball go between my legs. I was ridiculed, mercilessly, by my classmates for the next 6 years.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408040/" title="Cathedral High School 2 by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2364/2388408040_51d7647a2a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cathedral High School 2" /></a></p>
<p>While I was taking pictures, a chaprasi (attendant) came by and said that some teacher was angrily demanding that I explain myself and my shutterbugging habits. I told him I am an alumni but that didn't seem to placate anyone. Casually, trying not to run, I retreated to the car. </p>
<p>We drove to Mall Road to visit <a href="http://www.ferozsons.com.pk/">Ferozsons Ltd</a>. I had wanted to find these adventures of Hatim Tai that I used to read - but they only seemed to have the kid's tales version, which was not what I had in mind. Fun, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408540/" title="Scary readings. by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/2388408540_58c62223a7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Scary readings." /></a></p>
<p>Then, I walked down the Mall (followed by two C.I.D. guys, I think, who grew concerned when I started snapping pictures of an anti-Danish rally on the mall) and looked at the General Post Office, where I used to spend ungodly amounts of time. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2387719657/" title="Anti Danish Rally by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2387719657_8b8a990c30.jpg" width="500" height="290" alt="Anti Danish Rally" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408602/" title="General Post Office by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/2388408602_5ae2389554.jpg" width="500" alt="General Post Office" /></a></p>
<p>and, thought about mailing some postcards but couldn't find any ... postcards. Sorry, everyone, whom I promised a mailing from Lahore. I suck.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2387579865/" title="Postal Box by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2071/2387579865_76390923f9.jpg" width="500" alt="Postal Box" /></a></p>
<p>I was distracted, briefly, by the sight of headgear - it being hot and muggy that day. And I really needed some shade for my eyes. Nothing really appealed, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408396/" title="Love Thy Neighbor by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2327/2388408396_6d359984fe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Love Thy Neighbor" /></a></p>
<p>Then, I was distracted by <i>The Mummy</i> in Urdu. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2387579633/" title="Urdu Dubing by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2037/2387579633_414b9566da.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Urdu Dubing" /></a></p>
<p>But only momentarily. Soon, the A/C car was there, and we could jet back home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408132/" title="Work Commute by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3038/2388408132_60532e7a5b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Work Commute" /></a></p>
<p>But, not before we caught this exquisite, and routine, street kabuki theater.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2388408180/" title="Getting out of a Ticket by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2388408180_66e74b4136.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Getting out of a Ticket" /></a></p>
<p>I _love_ the bored slouches of the two public servants on the left.</p>
