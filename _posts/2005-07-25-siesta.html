    THE MASTER IS BACK! but chanwook is no master storyteller... \t4/5\n\t\t \nghghwndtlf:
    Chanwook is just trying to cash in this exquisite style. 1/5\t ghghwndtlf:
    Difficult.. The ending is groundlessly twisted.\t 2.5/5\t ksm0905: Ugh.. mannerism
    without a solid plot. Chanwook seem totally self-absorbed.  It just manifests
    Chanwook's cockiness... 1.5/5\t jpctec: It changes all of your 5 senses. Learn
    Chanwook before you open your 2-bit mouth. 5/5 baukunst: The performace of
    the cast was good. 4.5/5\t kkkssshhh2: Not as good as the expectations, but
    Young-Eh's performance is revetting. 3.5/5\n\t\nguriguri28: Unique visuals, supreme
    scenario... 4.5/5\t taeji7879: Comic violence, nonsensical plot, Oh, boy, I
    miss Old Boy... 4/5 kurosh:  You call this a movie? Chanwook, you pervert!!
    \ .5/5 sosimculb: SFLV is a black comedy about revenge, but it does not have
    the same sense of emotional salvation in the end as in Old Boy.\t4.5/5\n\t\nhoony073:
    It's a masterpiece where violence and tenderness are in perfect oscillation. 4.5/5 kissman87:
    vintage Chanwook style, but sub-Old-Boy plot.. 4.5/5"

<p>I will be quite busy over the next few weeks. Things are gathering momentum and if I don't make a stand, I might get swept away. What will you have of your lowly sepoy then? </p>
<p>My crew, my peeps, my homies are also busy with things and cannot entertain you sufficiently. They have my love and thanks for all they did. Maybe, now and then, one of them will pipe up.</p>
<p>I will try and keep posting the Sunday Readings series...at the least. Also, there is one special Empire post scheduled next weekish at Cliopatria. I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>In dubious traditions of dkos and atrios, I will leave an open thread post at the top. For those who wish to have a conversation, I will lurk around. Stay in the shade, and have a martini [gin [Raj], shaken, olive].</p>
