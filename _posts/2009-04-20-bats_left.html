<p>Things have been dour here, lately. I was thinking we needed to talk cricket, today. And, as if by magic, dear e. sent this awesome shot of President Hussein getting schooled by Brian Lara (Mr. <a href="/archives/not_baseball/400.html">400</a>). </p>
<p>The IPL has started in South Africa. India's biggest sporting event was moved due to security concerns to SA. The first few matches have already pit Shane Warne, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff against each other. I think no one won. I will try and catch some on youtube or elsewhere. The <a href="http://content.cricinfo.com/iplpage2/content/site/">IPL Page 2</a> site from cricinfo is quite, um, interesting?</p>
<p>In happy news, let it be noted that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/matthewpinsent/2009/04/batting_for_afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a> will be playing <a href="http://content.cricinfo.com/iccwcq2009/content/current/story/400167.html">international cricket</a>! As Hamid Hassan right writes, <a href="http://blogs.cricinfo.com/btw/archives/2009/04/the_most_famous.php">It is the most famous day in the history of Afghanistan cricket.</a> </p>
<p>In sad news, Pakistan lost the chance to host the 2011 world cup. Read <a href="http://content.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/400231.html">Osman Samiuddin</a> to get a sense of the loss. </p>
<p>Finally, as we contemplate President Hussein's stiff elbow, wide stance and off-positioned head, we should <a href="/archives/not_baseball/sultan_of_swing.html">remember that American Presidents don't make good cricketers.</a> </p>
