    a thing about Pakistan -- he suggested at one point on Slate that the US/UK etc
    prohibit all immigration from Pakistan.  (Hitchens should ask his friend Rushdie
    what colour was the passport that he traded in for British citizenship.)"

  content: Factual errors aside (most of Punjab is NOT in India), Hitchens piece should
    be reviewed AS an op-ed on an internet website, not an academic paper (freshman
    level or higher). One can (and probably should) take issue with the idea that
    the Western world has interests in that region or any other region. But as long
    as you are within that framework (and what mainstream commentator is not?) then
    his criticism of Pakistan is not far off the mark. Pakistan (or more properly,
    the pakistani army that more or less runs the country) has an expansionist ideology,
    based on some religious convictions that the rest of the world does not necessarily
    share. They have supported (and continue to support) various groups of free lance
    "militants" to serve their policy goals. Those goals are opposed to the policy
    goals of the US and its allies. He is warning the American reading public of this
    fact. From that perspective, why is his piece especially laughable?

  content: "Omar:  \"From that perspective, why is his piece especially laughable?\"  Because
    his entire argument is based on a name. I understand the politics of naming (like
    renaming Bombay as Mumbai, or referring to India as Bharat) and I don't necessarily
    discount these politics, but Hitchens' piece is laughable in that he sits there
    dissecting the name as if it were THE guiding force for people's actions and political
    cultures. Pakistani politics cannot simply be reduced to an infantile analysis
    of what 'P' stands for.  \"Factual errors aside (most of Punjab is NOT in
    India), Hitchens piece should be reviewed AS an op-ed on an internet website,
    not an academic paper\"  I seem to get the sensation that you expect less
    from journalistic pieces. Rest assured, journalistic op-eds are NOT supposed to
    be factually inaccurate, and have ridiculous arguments, even if reality tells
    us otherwise. I suspect that with Hitchens being a big name, either his editor
    didn't really go through this piece, or gave him a lot of leeway that other lesser
    known journalists wouldn't have.   And I don't think anyone was expecting
    a Ph.D style thesis or academic paper. Good journalistic pieces on Pakistan exist
    out there (even with the constraints of tone, style, word count and space limit);
    unfortunately, this Hitchens' piece wasn't one of them."

  content: I think its a good TACTIC to attack Hitchens by saying his whole argument

    thing to make a point about Pakistan's dominant/official ideology. Thats frequently
    done in op-eds and should not cause so much heartburn or misunderstanding. But
    again, if I were, say, the ISI's psyops officer, or Karl Rove hired to demolish
    Hitchens, then I would definitely take the name thing and run with it. When you
    want to demolish someone quickly, thats the sort of thing you do. But Karl Rove
    would know that Hitchens didnt really mean that the name is the root of the problem,
    and I hope you do too :)

    so much heartburn or misunderstanding.\"  What do you mean by \"tactic\"?
    I'm not out to attack Hitchens because he is Hitchens; I am taking issue with
    his argument, and that is perfectly legitimate. There is no denying that Pakistani
    politics are messy, etc (I mean, just look at CM-- it takes incisive jabs at what's
    happening there all the time, and Sepoy should be smooched all over for this).
      So, I AM serious, because his entire argument IS based on a name, and
    I think it's legitimate to attack his piece precisely for that, it has nothing
    to do with \"tactic.\" No one here has said that Pakistan's political scene is
    rosy-colored; commentators are taking issue with the basis of his assessment.
      Furthermore, I am being all the more serious because I have worked in
    both the American and South Asian media, and I have to say that there are writers
    and editors who hold up higher standards than this piece demonstrates. I for one,
    as a writer, never sought to make a weak, unrelated, or facetious claim to prove
    a larger point, and 2) my editors wouldn't have allowed me to get away with that
    in any case. There are blogs that are more well written than this, for god's sake.
    And really, where was the editor for this piece? On a three-day vacation?  And
    no, in my eyes, it is NOT an acceptable way to make a point about a larger picture
    by using a claim that really has little do with politics in action. The fact that
    this is done 'frequently in op-eds' is no justification for this. Just because
    it is a recurring practice (publishing a meretricious argument) and people like
    Maureen Dowd and Thomas Friedman get national and global airtime to spiel crap
    that they wouldn't even allow in J-School doesn't mean it's correct and we should
    accept it and not criticize. Demand more of the press, I say! :)"

  content: "\"Factual errors aside (most of Punjab is NOT in India)\"  The fact-checkers
    (\"editorial interns,\" in journalistic parlance) were probably taking a well-deserved
    weekend off for the first time in a long time, and this ignorant error slipped
    by. The poor things, overworked, overwhelmed, and living on slave-labor wages.
    Though fact-checkers should adhere to stringent standards, ultimately, factual
    accuracy is on Hitchens as the journalist and the editor (who, as I mentioned,
    was most likely on a three-day vacation).  It reminds me of the Newsweek
    error which stated in its print edition that Iran was a part of the \"Arab world.\"

---
<p>Christopher Hitchens, of much ill-repute, tries his <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2200134/">hand at Pakistan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The very name "Pakistan" inscribes the nature of the problem. It is not a real country or nation but an acronym devised in the 1930s by a Muslim propagandist for partition named Chaudhary Rahmat Ali. It stands for Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, and Indus-Sind. The stan suffix merely means "land." In the Urdu language, the resulting acronym means "land of the pure." It can be easily seen that this very name expresses expansionist tendencies and also conceals discriminatory ones. Kashmir, for example, is part of India. The Afghans are Muslim but not part of Pakistan. Most of Punjab is also in India. Interestingly, too, there is no B in this cobbled-together name, despite the fact that the country originally included the eastern part of Bengal (now Bangladesh, after fighting a war of independence against genocidal Pakistani repression) and still includes Baluchistan, a restive and neglected province that has been fighting a low-level secessionist struggle for decades. The P comes first only because Pakistan is essentially the property of the Punjabi military caste (which hated Benazir Bhutto, for example, because she came from Sind). As I once wrote, the country's name "might as easily be rendered as 'Akpistan' or 'Kapistan,' depending on whether the battle to take over Afghanistan or Kashmir is to the fore."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, so the <i>word</i> alone is enough! Who cares a whit about history, politics, culture, yadayada. Let's <i>divine</i> like oracles from Hafiz! Oh and quoting yourself? Priceless.</p>
