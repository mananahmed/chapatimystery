    These days it's better to have a puppet without a beard than the one with a beard for quite a few reasons. as far as economy is concerned i don't think it has anything to do with the puppet with no beard but it's  mainly because of the martyred former bearded puppet party of a certain neighbouring country who refused to hand over the puppet with sleepy eyes and immense money to the master of the masters and made it easier for the master puppet to hold the show.
    Why not keep the butcher of Gujrat fulltime PM.
    Imran khan and Jamima goldsmith have been divorced???????????saaaaaaaad.
    and also as a citibank account holder might i benefit from this comming set up.

  content: Yes, I do agree with you on the second point. The first time in history
    of Pakistan, our army seems to be profoundly heading towards disintegration. Never
    you could see that sense of resentment from the officers about the General in
    command. Also, I also agree with you on the account of hopes of our economy being
    improved. Shaukat Aziz might have said excluding IMF from future Economical decisions
    of Pakistan and it may very well be realized, but billions of aids would still
    be needed especially if Musharaf faces a real big backlash not from the moron
    politicians but his own staff officers (probably someone not from cabinet or GHQ
    guys though).

  content: Ejaz, we Pakistanis are so used to the way our country is run that I am
    reminded of Faiz's nazm which rings so true i.e "apni himmat hai keh hum phir
    bhee jeeyay jatay hain" (it is our courage that keeps us going on living like
    this) We have such low expectations from politicians that we do not mourn about
    the death of institutions any more. No one is looking at a deeper message being
    sent by the PML leadership sitting in the front row while Jamali announced his
    resignation that is :at the alter of politics, it is the guy from smaller provinces
    that has to relent whether in the form of forced resignation or other means (like
    1979) which have become sad part of our political history. Again Faiz is a harbinger
    of eternal optimism and even the nazm from which I have quited ends with "ik zara
    sabar, kay zulm kee miyaad kay din thoray hain" (a little patience, the days of
    injustice are numbered). Till that day dawns upon us when institutions are strong
    enough in Pakistan, we keep on living with this optimism. Rgds Naveed (Karachi)

  content: Yes, Deevan, you are certainly right and I admit being part of this at
    least. Well, again, I may be as passive and typical as I may sound, I think whatever
    happened to Jamali was much better than what "could have" happened. As I told
    Hemlock you could tell how a politician is living his life in Pakistan, how he
    dies is unimaginable. You can tell how Musharaf is living, how and in which circumstances
    would he die is something I have no vision to predict. Btw, it's very nice feeling
    to read Faiz sab. after a long time on web.

  content: Please guys I think it was a blesing in disguise getting rid of Jamali.
    The most incompetant, unpresentable person that has ever taken public office in
    Pakistan. Do you actually think that it was wise to keep Jamali on? What good
    was he? And who was he in the first place? I had never heard of him until he was
    announced as Prime Minister. I am no staunch supporter of Aziz but don't you think
    it is good omen for our country that a technocrat is taking over rather than a
    feudal politician. What good are feudals ?History has proven time and again how
    useless these creatures are and have been. Reason for the averse conditions of
    our country are due to these bastards and yet we want to keep them in power. It
    is time Pakistan accepts technocrats/beaurocrats in power because if they have
    performed in their careers they surely can perform in public office as well.

    <strong>New PM but Same Ruler</strong>

    Pakistan is having a change of Prime Minister, though it will still be ruled by Jamali&#8217;s boss, President-General Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan&#8217;s Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali has resigned following a meeting with the country&#8217;s Pr...

    <strong>Off with his head</strong>

    Islamabad's new rubber stamp It was inevitable. Poor Mir Zafarullah Jamali had to go. The manner in which his resignation was announced, and the palace intrigue sorrounding the choice of a successor sounds more Kremlinesque than democratic - in spite o...

<p><img src="/img/aziz.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Poor <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/ap20040626_468.html">Jamali</a>. He was doomed ever since he started "speaking from the heart" and getting too chummy with the <i>Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal</i> (MMA). For the last 2 months, numerous rumors of his resignation or firng circulated. The writing was indeed on the wall. Chosen as a rubber-stamp PM, he did his job admirably until his relationships began to undermine Mushy. Especially, the uniform mess.<br />
Shaukat Aziz, the Finance Minister, is now taking center stage (in 45 days). Anyone who saw the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/photos/Apr2003/030415-D-2987S-003.html">reception</a> awarded to Aziz on his April trip to D.C., could easily tag him as the US Candidate. That's him on the left up there with Wolfowitz who had the following to <a href="http://www.embassyofpakistan.org/news59b.php">say</a> about him:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">On a personal note, he praised Mr. Shaukat Aziz, saying he is the one person whom "I know quite well." "He was in John Hopkins, and he was later the most senior and successful executive in Citibank when he decided to go to Pakistan and offer his services-trying to repair Pakistan's economy that was in bad shape- a country which had seen sanctions. He said he saw Mr.Shaukat Aziz as "a man who was concerned and very determined to serve his country under the leadership of President Musharraf."<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Aziz brings that "spokesman" cred that Musharraf deliberately avoided in Jamali. Now that can mean two things:<br />
1. The US is tightening the screws and making Musharraf back off from playing Dictator or that<br />
2. Musharraf himself is losing his support in the military and needed a third-party neutral PM who has a good reputation as a can-do guy with no pesky loyalty issues.<br />
As Shujaat Husain, head of <i>Pakistan Muslim League</i> (PML) is the interim PM, I would go with option two. PML is the military rubber-stamp party.<br />
Either way, I don't think this was entirely a decision made in Islamabad. </p>
<p>Here is a most recent <a href="http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/aziz.cfm">interview</a> with Aziz that is filled with FM speak.<br />
I have to say that the one thing improving in Pakistan is the economy. And he gets credit for some of it (the rest of the credit goes to the billions in aid). </p>
<p>So, let's watch what happens now because with the ousting of Jamali, goes MMA. Maulana Fazlur Rahman, the head of MMA, was arrested in Karachi last night. He was arrested because <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.php?id=68805">MMA leadership has been banned</a> from Sindh, yet, he decided to fly into Karachi International. </p>
<p>Watch this <b>really</b> carefully.</p>
