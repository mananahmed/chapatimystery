    Interestingly, ditto in Russia: smiles valuable, American smiles considered cheap. Or so it is often generalised...

    I think, personally, that it's not just smiling. The superficiality of American civility in general confuses me (this is the pompous, "as a Brit" moment). I had to deal with a lot of Americans last summer on a fleeting, anonymous basis. 90% would introduce themselves with "how are you?", and I'd <em>always</em> fall for it, thinking they actually expected an answer, not realising that the question part of the question had no significance; or at least, a different significance.

    "How are you?"
    "I'm OK, yours--?"
    "We'd like to..."

  content: There are corresponding theories regarding the artificicality of people
    in the various regions of the US where folks are 'nice' and 'friendly' (and also
    smile lots).  Accordingly, only the very occasional friendliness of the usually
    grumpy folks in New England and the mid-Atlantic are truly genuine, whereas the
    warmth of the populace of other regions is somehow false or sinister (southerners
    are secretly racist, midwesterners are just going through the motions, Californians
    think they are better than you, etc).  Does this mean that people from Boston,
    New York and Philly (or the subcontinent, for that matter) do not brush their
    teeth as much?

    Rob: Favorite moment from my "Orientation" was when the International Advisor told us that: "When American girls say 'See You Later', it does NOT mean you have a hot date that evening."

    Dacoit: One can keep peeling an onion, no? And they def. don't brush their teeth in NYC. sheesh.

    I remember as a kid we watched American TV programmes and found the *teeth* somewhere between hilarious and terrifying. HUGE. WHITE. SMILES.

    The more you spent on your teeth, the greater the compulsion to show them off?

    Interesting thoughts. After more than 7 years in the US, I still haven't caught the smile bug. I wonder why.

    As dacoit points out, even in the US, smiles vary. I have not seen a New Yorker (city, not state) smile, for example. When my wife moved back from Jersey to Atlanta, she was surprised at how many people here say hi to strangers.

    The Pakistani sneer I have never liked, especially when it is so status-conscious. And at the wedding, no one allows the bride to smile. I have seen family elders admonishing the bride whenever she smiles during the ceremony.

    There is a stereotypicality to the idea that American smiles are fake but smiles, "hi", "how are you?" to strangers here are just that, nothing more.

    dil ke tukde tukde kar ke muskara ke chal diye...

    smiling, when you don't really mean it, is one of the crullest things you can do in the hindi film song tradition, a direct continuation of the hinustani-urdu poetry tradition....

    and oh, i've had a whale of a time in lahore without anyone smiling much - except once they figured i was indian. then the wattage came on, and the conversations, and the discounts/freebies.  and boy, did that feel great...

    people in delhi/elsewhere get really puzzled becuase i have a big goofy absent minded grin on my face a lot... 'why does he smile this much?'

    i would recommend watching the newwest indian advertisement for 'happydent' gum - a bizzzare twist on both sub-coninental 'smiling' and chris pinney's camera indica...

  content: "It's all about good teeth, innit?  American is a dental superpower, and
    the introduction of tooth whitening technolofy (the famed 'Revolution in Dental
    Affairs') has extended America's lead over the world, and even created in a significant
    dental gap (no pun intended) between the US and countries like Canada, which had
    previously been able to match the USA in toothsomeness.\n\nPakistanis don't floss,
    don't use mouthwash, don't wear braces in childhood, don't have electric toothbrishes,
    don't whiten, don't use waterpicks -- what do they have to smile about?  \n\nHairy
    Mango pits and sugarcane are not substitutes for flossing, and cardomom is not
    a breathfreshener.  Keep your yellowed teeth to yourselves."

  content: "the best is when the groom is frowning like a badass while wearing pink
    flowers AND TINSEL around his neck.  \n\nso, ok, i know it's crazy, but just for
    the sake of science let's say that  it's occasionally possible for an american
    smile to be FELT and MEANT.   the question that plagued me most in the land of
    the pure was not, why aren't they smiling, but, what are they FEELING?  (since
    \ my regular signposts - words and faces - were no longer reliable). let's set
    aside the smile of the Beloved for a moment (along with the arch of her eyebrow
    and her fragrant curl).  let's get down to brass tacks with ordinary internally
    mirthful, loving folks.  certainly non-smilers feel what i would consider to be
    smiley-feelings (love, happiness, a general bubbling over of warmth)  in at least
    some circumstances similar to those which make smilers smile.  i wonder how those
    feelings (where they come from, where they end up, the pictures they create or
    emerge from in the mind...) might  be different when they have no physical manifestation.
    \n\ni tried, as an experiment while in pakistan, to resist the upward tugging
    of mouth muscles when i felt a tiny leap of glee or a sweep of gratitude or appreciation
    (ok i'm not counting sitting in a chair being solemnly presented with wedding
    money by a string of aunties while the tv in the background blared the good, the
    bad and the ugly...).  in those situations not smiling felt much like holding
    in a sneeze, only harder.  \n\nso...i guess for me the question is:  are the non-smilers
    holding back, are they stifling an impulse ?  (perhaps without much effort, having
    practiced from any early age.)  or, is the facial impulse simply not there, are
    the muscles not connected to the emotional center in the same way?  \n\nthere's
    gotta be a study...."

  content: I'm from the Midwest. I was raised by Southern Black people who believed
    in good manners which meant that you smile and greet people. I went to college
    in New York and everyone was aghast that I smiled and spoke to complete strangers.
    I guess I was raised by hopeful people. I really hate this idea that American
    smiles are so insincere. DARN IT! I smile because I want to. I smile because I'm
    feeling blessed to be living my life. I understand why some people aren't smiling.
    Of course, my angry look scares the hell out of everyone. I also get a lot of
    "angry Black woman" b-s from non-Black people. So, I can't win. And I'm trying
    to prepare for my travels around Southeast Asia, India, & the Middle East by not
    smiling at people, especially males, but it is so hard because I'm happy to have
    the opportunity to travel.

    There is nothing wrong with a smile and they could certainly use lots of them back home. It took me some time to learn to smile back. But, I still find it creepy even to the point of feeling dirty when a complete unkown whitey smiles at me for no good reason. And knowing they are all fake smiles(at least most of them), I even get a little pissed because I have to show the same fakeness back.

    Seriously, It's bad enough enduring their oppresive ways and now they want us to smile at them? We're not your monkies! We don't dance for no one White-Devil! ;-)

    about cleaning of teeth- it's been my understanding until now that the goras discovered the
    toothpick long before the toothbrush(and quite reluctantly at that). and in the sub-continent you'd find the brush among other items of personal use excavated from mohenjodaro. the neem twig ,i hope, is what the toothbrush would evolve into when it grows up.

    I smiled at her and Said, "Assalam-O-Alaikum!" n I find it very rude and I was

  content: I am an American and yes I do have a tendency to smile alot to strangers
    and in public. Yes, there is SOME false pretense smiles in certain individuals
    that is used to get what they want in our culture. But for the most part our smiles
    are sincere in one degree or another the possible reason for this is because we
    as a country havent had to deal with dictators, communist, or just plane tyrants
    so we have had the ability to express our own emotions without worring about offending
    someone or worse getting thrown in jail or shoot for smiling at the wrong moment.
    So as some of you would say I am just another pompous American for thinking in
    such a way then yes I am pompous and those how are offened should for once think
    for themselves and not be controlled by others, instead try indulging in a little
    bit of everyones culture if you do then you could get a better unstanding. As
    for the rest thank you for trying to understand.

  content: As an American I can see why our smiles may be considered "insincere" but
    to truly understand you have to first understand why we smile. To do that you
    have to put yourself in our shoes.  In most places, or even in simple conversations
    it can be thought of as rude if you don't acknowledge someone politely and for
    us, it goes hand in hand with a simple smile. It doesn't mean much more than that
    if you're a stranger. In our culture, (depending on the situation) not smiling
    can be considered rude, hostile, or give the impression that somethings wrong.
    We are taught that not smiling is associated with depresssion, sadness, shyness,
    unfriendliness, and a whole list of other negative things.   Although you can
    use New York as an example of people not smiling, they are only one state and
    clearly one of the exceptions. Even a New Yorker will ask "how  are you?" and
    not care for the answer. On the flip side if you ask an American that you just
    met how they are doing, it's normal to get a short response or sometimes no response
    at all.  To call it "insincere" is really not understanding it.  True, we may
    not value a smiles' meaning as much as other cultures.  It may seem superficial
    and unusual for us to smile at you but rest assured we are simply being polite,
    nothing more.

    fear and sorrow\r\nSmile and maybe tomorrow\r\nYou'll find that life is still

    you must keep on trying\r\nSmile, what's the use of crying\r\nYou'll find that
    life is still worthwhile\"\r\n\r\nI think these lyrics sum up most Americans attitudes
    about smiles. Some say our smiles are insincere. But to this I say bah. Americans
    are optimistic people. We know we are not perfect.  But in our heart of hearts,
    we would like to think we are honest and hopeful. This is why we smile. \r\n\r\nI
    know as a woman. I have had entire conversations with other women who I did not
    even know just by smiling. The smile conducted between me and a little old lady
    said this:\r\n\r\nMe- hello little old lady, I respect you as my elder, so here
    is a smile. I hope it brightens your day. \r\n\r\nOld lady- thank you for smiling
    young lady. You seem respectful, and lord knows there are so many young people
    who aren't. So I thank you for your smile. Have a nice day young lady.\r\n\r\nMe-
    Thank you mame. I will and I hope you do to.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what our smiles
    said, and I held the door open for her as she left the library because she had
    a crap load of books. \r\n\r\nNow you do have contradictory situations. Where
    the smile is more of a feral act of bearing your fangs towards your enemy. I think
    the best example I have seen of this was the during  the last vice presidential
    debates. Biden and Palin seemed more like they were snarling at each other than
    smiling.\r\n\r\nBut even then. There was still some optimism because both debaters
    were trying to project confidence and create a political victory. They were both
    smiling because in their own minds they were manifesting their victory, and in
    America winners smile (especially on the box of wheaties cereal).\r\n\r\nThis
    is the beauty and power of a smile. You can enrage, frighten, and disarm an enemy
    by smiling in their face. But you can also use the same smile to shower feelings
    of love, respect, and warmth on loved ones and strangers. If anything. I would
    say Americans have gathered an understanding of the smile from frequent practice
    and use.  We respect and love what smiles stand for, and can't imagine not having
    those frequent reminders in our lives as Americans."

  content: "It's not that American smiles \"aren't sincere,\" as is often the interpretation
    by those outside the culture. In the U.S., smiles are used to express a larger
    number of different emotions and nonverbal cues than they are in other cultures.
    \r\n\r\nIn America there are \"over 50 different types of smiles,\" whereas in
    some other countries there may be only 1 type of smile (in which case a smile
    is typically only used to reflect a limited range of emotions, usually happiness
    or love). Hence the confusion on behalf of many new to the U.S. \r\n\r\nAmericans
    use smiles to express a wide range of emotions and unspoken meanings. Smiles can
    mean anything from a sign of mere acknowledgment or a greeting, a sign of true
    happiness, a sign of love, and even a sign of spite, resentment, or condescension.
    \r\n\r\nIn this way it may be similar to speaking Mandarin. The word for \"love\"
    means something completely different based on it's verbal tone. In American culture,
    a smile means something completely different based on it's physical \"tone.\"
    If you never grew up experiencing these tones, you might listen to someone speaking
    Mandarin and think that they love you or that they're not genuine when they use
    the word love. (This is probably an exaggeration, but it's the same type of \"lost
    in translation\" situation.). \r\n\r\nIn another similar example, in Italian culture
    it is not atypical for someone to hold your hands while you speak. Americans view
    this as an act of Italians being friendly, since physical contact is only used
    as a sign of affection (much like smiles are only used as a sign of affection
    in other cultures). However, many Italians do this as a sign that they want you
    to shut up (lol). If you weren't brought up with the different types of physical
    contact in Italian culture, you might not recognize these differences. This might
    shock some foreigners or cause some to think Italians are \"insincere in their
    physical contact.\" \r\n\r\nAs such, it might be difficult for someone who isn't
    raised in American culture to tell the subtle tones of one type of smile from
    another (in some cases being culturally brought up with only one use for a smile),
    and so they may have a difficult time adjusting to the smiley Americans or simply
    cast the phenomenon off as \"Americans just aren't genuine with their smiles like
    we are.\" \r\n\r\nOverall, although the U.S. is largely a more verbally expressive
    country, Americans are much more non-verbally communicative through their smiles
    than many other cultures are. This just may take some getting used to."

    a person or anything that has to do with people. For example in Spanish you can
    say I love my country or I love my home, being that your country and your home
    are made of people.\r\n\r\nSo if a smiling American says to you, \"I love your
    hair!\" Don't think they are trying to convince you that he/she has affection
    towards your hair, or that your hair brought out such a great emotion that it
    caused a rare smile on his/her face. Just enjoy the compliment, smile, say thank
    you, don't read too much into it and move on with your life."

  content: "Some people are just genuinely happy and smiley. There's this one girl
    at Walmart who can brighten your day just by being within 15 feet of you. She's
    so happy and perky, and if any of it is fake, she sure fools me!\r\n\r\nHowever,
    she's a definite minority. As weird as this would sound to most people, since
    I've been researching other cultures, I've been trying to cut down on smiling.
    A decent amount of my smiles are definitely fake. It's a defense against how badly
    I'm treated where I live. In school, I'd smile constantly to show the people who
    bullied me, \"You haven't broken me, and you CAN'T break me!\" Years later, I
    barely even know how to smile sincerely anymore! American fakeness is all-pervasive
    and quite pathetic."

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/smile.jpg" align=left>I stood in the International Student Registeration Line a long time ago. Barely two days in the States, I was expected to know which classes to take and how to take them. A california sky-kissed beauty welcomed me with a radiant smile, "How can I help you?". My first reaction, I remember vividly, was the thrill that she TOTALLY wanted to marry me. She was <i>smiling</i> so warmly. My second reaction, after some thought [and the lack of any marriage proposals], was how insincere Americans are; throwing their precious smiles at strangers. It took a long time for the second reaction to wear off. It took even longer for me to learn to smile at strangers. </p>
<p><img alt="No Smiles Allowed" src="{{site.baseurl}}images/Akhbar-e-jahan_shadi.jpg" title="No Smiles Allowed" width="292" />There are no public smiles in Lahore. Strangers greet each other with a poker-face. Those above you on the social power-relational scale [clerks, traffic cops] greet you with a hostile sneer. Those below you [clerks, traffic cops] get greeted with a contemptuous sneer. There are no smiles when you complete a transaction at the store. There are no smiles when you open the door for someone. There are no smiles when you find yourself looking at the same thing or sharing the same public space. There are no smiles when you ask directions to Mall Road. We don't even smile at our weddings [aside: I used to love "reading" the newly-wed pictoral in <i>Akhbar-e Jahan</i>. Some real stories in those snaps. For example, look at Mr. Majid' wife (column one, row four)]. Why not? Are we humorless prigs? Isn't smiling a universal emotion? When I asked some desi friends [two were f.o.b's], they said that American smiles were hollow and empty. "They just show you their teeth. There is no warmth". </p>
<p>On the contrary, they claimed that, desi smiles were genuine and heartfelt because of their rarity. A smile <i>is</i> something precious in Indo-Persiante culture. The smile of a beloved, in classical Urdu and Persian poetry, is all that one needs and pines for. <i>Khandidan</i>, <i>tabassum</i>, <i>muskarahat</i> are playful words for a beloved's smile that can be easily found in the works of Rumi or Hafiz or Mir or Ghalib. Why isn't it more accepted then? Perhaps, it is the poetics that have made the smile into such a loaded category. We cannot smile without thinking of Mir or Ghalib. Cultural barriers of propriety and shame are so entrenched that a smile is almost always transgressive.     </p>
<p>Why, then, do the Americans smile so much? Did Shakespeare and Whitman asked them to? Or is this a genetic issue? A cultural one? Is it learned? I am neither a sociologist nor a psychologist. But, I am sure the answer can be found in the literature of those fields. Little I know, from reading Thomas Frank and Steven Fox, is that smiling was not always so <a href="/img/SmileStudy.gif" target=blank>prevalent</a>. It was the WWI army that introduced teeth-cleaning to US men. <a href="/img/WPA1938_Teeth.jpg" target=blank>Public projects</a> re-inforced the message and the advertising agencies selling <a href="/img/TeethAd1926.gif" target=blank>toothpaste</a> told everyone to smile brightly. See. We can blame the ad agency for almost ANYTHING. </p>
<p>All this because a dear friend visited Pakistan for the first time recently and was struck by <i>"how very few people smile at newcomers in a welcoming gesture of cheerful unilateral acceptance? not a one. guess i never really knew just how american i am."</i> [quoted without permission and with apologies]. Everyone I know who came from homistan to vilayat had this run-in with the smile. Everyone I know who went from here to the old country, asked me why everyone is so grim all the time? It is an odd sign of our collective other-ness. Unsurprisingly, I am constantly reminded by my friends and relatives of how American I am [the no-accent thing is my inside joke]. I do smile at strangers. I even mean it sometimes.</p>
