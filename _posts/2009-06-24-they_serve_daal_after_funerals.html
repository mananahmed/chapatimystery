  content: "<i>U.S. officials concede missiles fired from drones have targeted suspected
    militant leaders in the tribal zone for months, but they do not comment on individual
    strikes</i>  Algebra of Infinite Justice  by Arundhati Roy  \"Here's
    the rub: America is at war against people it doesn't know, because they don't
    appear much on TV. Before it has properly identified or even begun to comprehend
    the nature of its enemy, the US government has, in a rush of publicity and embarrassing
    rhetoric, cobbled together an \"international coalition against terror\", mobilized
    its army, its air force, its navy and its media, and committed them to battle.
      The trouble is that once America goes off to war, it can't very well return
    without having fought one. If it doesn't find its enemy, for the sake of the enraged
    folks back home, it will have to manufacture one. Once war begins, it will develop
    a momentum, a logic and a justification of its own, and we'll lose sight of why
    it's being fought in the first place. \"  http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1003-09.htm"

  content: "I agree with a lot of the criticism of the US empire, but its not correct
    to say that the empire \"invents enemies\". it has real enemies, like all empires
    before it. Its a war. Do you think the Mongols or the Arabs \"invented enemies\"?
    You conquer foreign lands you may find some real enemies. And sometimes the choice
    is between giving up the particular colony or killing those resisting you.   Will
    it be an improvement when the Chinese and the Indians and the Pakistanis and the
    Persians (and the Russians)  fight over the frontier lands but not the US?  That
    may be so..... while the US is a little  more careful of civilian casualties than
    the Russians or Chinese (or Pakistanis for that matter), its a far away power
    with too much firepower and too little local knowledge..maybe  in the long run
    its bombs will kill more people than the less discriminating Pakistani or Indian
    or Russian bombs?  As you can see, I am convinced SOME bombs will do some killing
    no matter what. Afghanistan is unable to control its own territory. Surrounding
    powers all have their proxies there. I dont see how the fighting can end until
    everyone knows they cannot win any further and moves towards compromise...and
    we are nowhere close to that stage yet."

  content: "Jan,   I am not talking about whether propaganda is used or not.
    obviously it is. But beyond the propaganda, there IS a real war on. And the US
    is not the most interested party (though it is the one with the best bombs). Afghanistan
    has fallen apart. Pakistan, India, China, Russia, Iran, all are fighting over
    who controls it. That war will go on, with or without American bombs (it was very
    much on BEFORE american bombs landed).  Local chamchas are not just chamchas
    of the US. There are lots of Pakistani and Indian and Iranian andRussian spoons
    in there. And they all bring less development money and less discrimination in
    target selection than the US. If i were an afghan, I would greatly prefer the
    American spoons in this struggle. I am not saying every afghan will agree with
    me. ..but if you tell me that they all hate America and want the taliban and the
    ISI and RAW to sort out their state free of American intervention then you have
    not met the same Afgans as I have..And yes, a lot of them would prefer to see
    ALL foreign intervention cease right now, but I am not describing my dream of
    Afghanistan, I am describing the situation that actually exists. In the actually
    existing situation an afghanistan without foreign intervention MAY develop if
    the Americans can stabilize a central govt and then leave. It will NOT happen
    anytime soon in any other scenario."

  content: 'Omar: I agree with much of what you say, but I do not think that (I''ll
    use the label here for ease of discussion) anti-imperialism is -- or ought to
    be -- animated by the view that those who espouse or advance imperialism are less
    innocent than others.  That is, IMO the point is not that the ISI, RAW, Pakistanis,
    Indians, whoever, are morally just as compromised as the Americans who are blamed
    by everyone in Pakistan for the mess in the region -- the question is whether
    they are potentially just as destructive.  Thus, the political elite in Bhutan
    is likely no purer than the one in India -- however, only one of those has the
    power to cast a relatively wide footprint, hence it is perhaps natural for people
    to focus on it and not on Bhutan.  In other words, anti-imperialism should attempt
    to engage with a systemic problem (and not with the personal guilt of individuals
    -- the latter is itself a worthy object of inquiry, but does not need any ideological
    apparatus beyond that of the criminal law, fact-finding missions, etc.).   [Not
    to mention that the other "actors" mentioned in your comment are themselves implicated
    in the wider neo-imperial power structure.  For instance, one would be hard-pressed
    to deny the destructive effects of the utterly cynical machinations of the Pakistani
    military-intelligence apparatus in Afghanistan, but those strategies have themselves
    been enabled by the wreckage/aftermath of a wider struggle between two contending
    Cold War great powers.  It''s simply impossible to tell what this or any other
    region would "look like" absent such great power-interventions.  Doubtless it
    would have its heroes and villains, its tyrants and knaves.  But their ability
    to wreak havoc on societies around them would hardly be so potent]...'

  content: "I think American aims have changed with time.  American planners calculate
    profit and loss like everyone else. If a \"friendly\"  govt can hold on without
    their direct presence, then they will leave. its always cheaper to have a local
    elite do the ruling. That may not happen too soon.  Again, I dont think its a
    good idea for america to be invading distant countries and setting up \"friendly\"
    govts.  I was not trying to present what i want, but more what I think is likely
    to happen. if it was up to me, I would prefer to see all countries shrink to the
    size of Denmark and then join in loose arrangements that allow free travel and
    trade and no one has big armies or invades anyone else. I dont see that as very
    likely in the near future though (and no, I dont think the Chinese will be a huge
    improvement over American imperialism either).  Of course its foreign intervention
    when america invaded afghanistan. Just as it was foreign intervention when the
    ISI did the same or when Russia and Iran and India propped up the northern alliance
    against the taliban.  Bhutan is not the best analogy.  As far as I know, the
    bhutanese ruling class does not have vast transnational ambitions. The jihadist
    faction of the Pak army (and that was the faction that was in charge till recent
    events led to some readjustments) does have very definite ambitions beyond their
    current borders. Left to themselves, they will not just creat utopia in Afghanistan.
    \  But I will also add that these are not well formulated thoughts in my own
    mind. I am trying to figure this out while we argue. I may end up on your side
    of the argument."

  content: These comments by Obama were featured on last night's "Daily Show," with
    Jon Stewart replying, "Making keema and daal and reading Urdu poetry is great,
    but now fix the fucking economy!" I respect and admire the way Obama is reaching
    out to other countries (and I'm sure it's a calculated response to his predecessor)
    but this may be going a bit overboard on the superficial factors and moving farther
    away from the policy. It seems that Obama's pronunciation of "Pakistan" is getting
    far more press than his actual decisions in the region.

  content: "<i>&ldquo;7. It takes a lot of incompetent people to run
    an empire. </i>  I read Graham Greene,s \"Quiet American\" a while ago but
    Andrew Bacevich has reviewed it again as it is  as pertinent  as ever.  \"Pyle's
    job is to devise this Third Way. As he undertakes this task, Pyle draws inspiration
    from a journalist named York Harding, a sort of proto—Thomas
    Friedman who parachutes into various trouble spots and then in best-selling books
    serves up glib recipes for advancing the cause of liberty. In Pyle's
    estimation, the challenge he faces does not appear all that difficult. York Harding
    provides the answer: &ldquo;you only had to find a leader and keep
    him safe from the old colonial powers.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Impregnably
    armored by his good intentions and his ignorance,&rdquo; Pyle embodies
    all that Fowler (and Greene) can't stand about Americans: too
    much money, too much confidence, and too little self-awareness. Cruising the streets
    of Saigon in oversized Buicks, air conditioning everything in sight (to Fowler's
    dismay, even the U.S. legation's lavatories), passing out cigarettes
    as if they exist in infinite supply, and quoting York Harding, zealots like Pyle
    proceed on the assumption that American know-how backed by American values can
    make short work of even the most perplexing difficulties. Born and raised a Unitarian,
    Pyle takes God's existence as a given, his faith reinforcing
    his conviction that America's purposes necessarily reflect
    God's will........   .......When not conspiring to steal
    Fowler's girl, Pyle is conspiring to devise the Third Way,
    his efforts to find the right leader centering on a shadowy figure known as General
    Th&Atilde;&copy;. As with the U.S. officials who in our own day fell under the
    spell of Ahmed Chalabi, Pyle has persuaded himself that General Th&Atilde;&copy;'s
    aims and America's aims align neatly. As was the case with
    Chalabi, this turns out to be a massive misjudgment.Positioning General Th&Atilde;&copy;
    as the anointed successor to the French requires first demonstrating the powerlessness
    of the colonial regime. This effort finds expression in a campaign of terror orchestrated
    by Th&Atilde;&copy;, using plastic explosives covertly provided by Pyle, but to
    be blamed on the Communists. Pyle purports to believe that the campaign will concentrate
    on military targets. In fact, Th&Atilde;&copy; organizes a savage attack on civilians
    in the center of Saigon, which Fowler and Pyle witness.   Momentarily taken
    aback by the bloody consequences of his handiwork&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;his shoes
    are spattered with human remains&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Pyle quickly recovers and
    assures Fowler that the victims of the bombing had &ldquo;died for
    democracy.&rdquo; Their deaths were a &ldquo;pity,&rdquo;
    he tells Fowler, &ldquo;but you can't always hit
    your target. Anyway they died in the right cause.&rdquo; Pyle's
    own sense of righteousness survives the incident intact. He knows he meant well.
    That knowledge obviates any need to take responsibility or to make amends. In
    his own mind, he remains blameless.  Fowler's own determination
    to avoid taking sides does not survive this episode. In his innocence, Pyle has
    become like &ldquo;a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering
    the world, meaning no harm,&rdquo; even as he contaminates everything
    he touches. The ease with which Pyle rationalizes and then dismisses the results
    of his own recklessness persuades Fowler that detachment has become untenable.
    So the observer becomes a participant. \"  http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/2009%20-%20Summer/full-Bacevich.html"

    of bombardment than actual attack, gamely embracing \"terror\" as its main tactical
    principle. As I discovered while researching Air Ministry documents, officials
    privately confessed that the public was not ready for the truth that air warfare
    had made distinctions between civilians and combatants \"obsolete.\" And the Middle
    East offered an ideal terrain for its education: this was the region in which
    civilian deaths would be easiest to stomach, air staff officials argued, since
    Arabs and Pathans \"love fighting for fighting's sake...They have no objection
    to being killed.\" In 1924, Squadron Leader Arthur Harris, head of Bomber Command
    in World War II, reported having shown Iraqis 'what real bombing means, in casualties

    automatic apologist for him occassionally.  That said, US policy is far

<blockquote><p>Any plan to visit Pakistan in the near future?'<br />
'I would love to visit. As you know, I had Pakistani roommates in college who were very close friends of mine. I went to visit them when I was still in college; was in Karachi and went to Hyderabad. Their mothers taught me to cook,' said Mr Obama.</p>
<p>'What can you cook?'<br />
'Oh, keema &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; daal &acirc;&euro;&brvbar; You name it, I can cook it. And so I have a great affinity for Pakistani culture and the great Urdu poets.'</p>
<p> 'You read Urdu poetry?'<br />
'Absolutely. So my hope is that I'm going to have an opportunity at some point to visit Pakistan,' said Mr Obama.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN AGENCY: The death toll in suspected US drone strike in the South Waziristan Agency has risen to 65, witnesses and officials said late on Tuesday adding that the missiles hit a funeral procession. </p>
<p>Sohail Mehsud from the town of Makeen in the South Waziristan tribal region said he saw three unmanned drones fired missiles on Tuesday afternoon at the funeral procession for suspected militants killed by a similar strike earlier in the day. </p>
<p>At least two missiles were fired at the funeral prayers, killing at least 17 people earlier and injuring several others but later in the day the death toll mounted to 65.</p>
<p>The missile attack targeted the hideouts of Baitullah Mehsud, where Commander Sangeen is reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>Commander Sangeen belongs to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>U.S. officials concede missiles fired from drones have targeted suspected militant leaders in the tribal zone for months, but they do not comment on individual strikes.
