    are you taking votes on which of these to actually write?  if so, im ranking them as follows:



    1) postcolonialism

    2) AIML

    3) zotero

    4) devji

    5) qutb



    it would be particularly interesting to see you try to combine 1+2 or 4+5.

  content: AIML, Devji, POCO, and Youtube. Saw your favourites, and this is quite
    a coincidence, as I posted one of your favourite songs on the blog just today.

<p>I wish to inform you that in the past few weeks, I should have written the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A review of Jonathan Lear's brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Hope-Ethics-Cultural-Devastation/dp/0674023293/sr=8-1/qid=1163642403/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4396133-0380737?ie=UTF8&s=books">Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation</a>.
</li>
<li>My thoughts on Sudhir Venkatesh's talk at the IHouse. He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674023552/downandoutint-20">Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor</a>.
</li>
<li>The inevitable Borat post.
</li>
<li>The next post in the <i>Polyglot Manifesto</i> series - which is the paper I presented at Madison.
</li>
<li>About <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>.
</li>
<li>What I have learned - and hope to put into use - from teachers of postcolonialism at Chicago.
</li>
<li>All India Muslim League - a conference we organized recently.
</li>
<li>My Thomas Paine project.
</li>
<li>A snarky post about how tone-deaf the major conferences are - in this case, <a href="http://www.aasianst.org/">AAS</a> - to standard internet practices. Even ones dedicated to computing, <a href="http://www.theaahc.org/">AAHC</a>, need work.
</li>
<li>A really snarky post about 8 kinds of wrong in Faisal Devji's ISIM article <a href="http://www.isim.nl/files/Review_18/Review_18-30.pdf">Global War on Terror as De-Militarization</a> [pdf link].
</li>
<li>A really really snarky post about Sayyid Qutb and the experts of GWOT and Islamism.
</li>
<li>A post about the up-heavels in Pakistan on all fronts. Nuts, really.
</li>
<li>A review of Dirks' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scandal-Empire-Creation-Imperial-Britain/dp/0674021665/sr=1-1/qid=1163642455/ref=sr_1_1/104-4396133-0380737?ie=UTF8&s=books">The Scandal of Empire: India and the Creation of Imperial Britain</a>.
</li>
<li>Insane YouTube clips of songs from the Golden Age of Hindi cinema, break-dancing, and mujras from Pakistan. You can see some that I added to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_favorites?user=sepoy">my favorites</a>.
</li>
<li>A post about the <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/31289.html">Annual Cliopatria Awards</a> for best of the history blogosphere. Telling you to go nominate your favorites.
</li>
</ul>
<p>HOWEVER, I confess that I haven't done any of the above. You don't need reasons, gentle readers. You and I go back - way back. You are indulgent. I will just mention that my hunt for a professorship, my somewhat increased biodegradability, and my work are to be blamed. I miss CM. The good news is that I can see the end of the insanity. Soon.</p>
