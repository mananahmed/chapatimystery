    fond memories of visiting my sister when she was at FJ Med. Coll. in the 1960s
    and riding tongas to Anarkali for chaat!   I remember quite a few when I
    was last in Lahore in 2001. When did become scarce?"

<p>I have a great story ... from when I was 10 ... and it involves a tanga, ice-cream in a cone and Fortress Stadium at night. There are no tangas left in Lahore anymore. Below is the only one I saw. The story is meaningless, without a tanga, isn't it?</p>
