    pins too much blame on women's groups, but then I started reading the comments.\r\n\r\nTo
    think I sort of pretended that moving to Europe was part of an effort to get away
    from this sort of thing (a na&Atilde;&macr;ve fantasy, of course, but still...)"

    court. Does anyone know how such an appeal might work?"

    is trying to reassure Muslims that Switzerland isn't really like that.... Yeesh."

    you need to check yourself if you want to make sense to the academic mainstream.
    \ I have no idea what this means (other than Jew-envy, perhaps?).  The position
    of Muslims, whether in the world at large, or in the West, has little analogy
    with that of the Jews.  Maybe the Parsis are an analog--numerous, illiterate,
    poor Muslims are not--sorry, big-guy."

    to detract anything from their acheivement, epecially beating a really good Nigerian
    team in the finals, where no one gave them much of  a chance; you should have
    mentioned that this is their U17 national team, not their international squad.
    The U17s are amongst the lower ranked youth teams in anycase.\r\n\r\nThe vote
    doesn't surprise me, Swiss society does have some reactionary streaks that tends
    to react adversely to what they see as 'outside influences'; the strong internalisation
    of parts of the country like Geneva, just adds to this tension."

  content: Yes, the U17 squad is very mixed, but even the squad that made the finals
    in South Africa next year features two players of Turkish origin, Inler and Yakin,
    with Yakin as one of the most-capped Swiss players currently active. Furthermore,
    the U17 squad is a sign of things to come, which is that Switzerland, including
    its national team, will get more and more Muslim and more immigrant.

  content: "Yes, the only thing I would say though, is that football is physically
    probably the most demanding and erratic sport at the moment in terms of player
    development and injuries; so apart from a few top players in every cohort, it
    is difficult to tell how many young players will make it after their early phases
    into the professional game.\r\n\r\nI didn't know Yakin was in the WC squad, thought
    he had been dropped since last year. He was good in the Euros though, from what
    I saw."

  content: "Yakin is probably transitioning out, as he was rode pine against Israel last month. However, Inler started, as did Derdiyok, who is all of 21 and who scored the point-saving second goal with his first touch off the bench against Latvia in Sept. So there were still two players of Turkish origin on the pitch at the opening whistle of the most recent Swiss qualifier. Yakin did come in off the bench in the previous match against Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nEither way, it's a safe bet that at least two of the three will go to South Africa this summer."

  content: "I wouldn't overrate the Swiss' decision to ban Minarets. \r\n\r\nThe Muslims
    here are reacting very reasonably, showing their disappointment but not acting
    enraged. There are 4 minarets so far - there were no big plans for many more.\r\n\r\n
    It's a little bit like the argument of a Sanaullah who commented in a Pakistan
    Labour Party Forum last week on the death sentence on one of the Gojra Christians
    on desecrating the Quran:\r\n\r\n>>It may sound ridiculous but I have heard that
    sometimes courts of\r\nfirst instance pronounce death punishment in such cases
    to save the\r\nlife of the accused as they know the weakness of the evidence will\r\nlead
    to acquittal from high court but death penalty may help the\r\nhounds [in that
    case the Jamaati Mullahs] to cool down and hopefully forget about the matter.<<\r\n\r\nWe
    give the SVP and the initiative founders their victory and they will stop/diminish
    their horrible populism on Islam that actually may lead to a rift in society at
    one point since support for them is rising. The minarets won&#039;t.\r\n\r\nLittle
    known fact, in one of Austria&#039;s provinces Minarets are banned now for quite
    some time already. And the same \"discussions\" (one sided media-digging-out-half-truths
    commentaries in newspapers) that have preceded the popular vote here and have
    turned quite nasty are quelling in Austria for years now. There its still getting
    worse. Here in Switzerland it&#039;s about to cool down again with the vent they
    got on Sunday."

  content: "If this is the attitude of the West regarding Muslims, then why should
    Muslims feel any tolerance for non-Islamic symbols in Muslim land? \r\n\r\nIt
    is only fair to ask.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Churches and temples continue to be built
    with full galore in Islamic countries. There is no talk of banning the church
    bell, or removing the cross. No Christian Nuns are harassed for wearing their
    headcover. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note Western sensibilities (rather  insensibilities),
    that they see Hijaab as demeaning to women but have no qualms about catholic nuns
    being forced to stay celibate as part of religious requirement  denying them the
    right of legitimate sex.  Similarly, on one hand all the hell break loose when
    Muslims request not making fun of their religious figures. The west takes that
    as violation of their freedom of speech.  On the other hand they are,hypocritically,
    quiet when a Jew violates the same freedom of expression if some westerner dare
    to draw a cartoon or criticize Holocaust.  Why can't Holocaust be criticized?
    Why can't you say that \"O Jews!!! enough of your Holocaust rant. Stop playing
    victims now. You are no more victims. You are actually perpetrating the same crimes
    to  Palestinians now...\"\r\n\r\nWhy don't you draw a cartoon on that? Why don't
    you force jews to assimilate? Jews still get to built their temples with full
    galore. Jews still get to celebrate Hanukah. Jews still get to wear the skull
    cap.\r\n\r\nWhy these double standards? Why are you silent on that? Your silence
    is deafening."

<p>I wonder what the world would be saying if this game had the bearded fella sporting peyots along with that sporty 'stache. But since Muslims are the new (old) Jews, this sort of pure <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6936267.ece">islamophobia</a> will skip by without comment from the cognoscenti.</p>
