  content: Was emailed a couple of YouTube videos, one was Chacha Wardi Landa Kyun
    nahin, which is still up on YouTube. Another was a parody of Main Hoon Na featuring
    the generalissimo, which seems to have been removed for "terms of use violation."
    Shame, it was very clever.

  content: "Re: Load shedding in Lahore...Velcome to South Asia!\r\n\r\nHere in Kathmandu
    it's up to 8 hours a day. Saturdays suck the most because the lights go out at
    8 PM. Can you believe that? Nothing to do but twiddle your thumbs under the candlelight
    with everyone else and then zonk out around 9 PM."

    around the same time, and maybe I can give you the hard-copy version of that article
    on hijras I owe you...

Gentle Readers,</p>
<p>I ask so little of you. And I give you so much. </p>
<p>Well, the fairy tale has to end some day, right? </p>
<p>So. </p>
<p>CM will be largely silent for the next few weeks and I need to make some announcements for your help.<br />

<p>1. CM will be participating in Aitzaz Ahsan's <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dcwznz68_22hg2p6tg7">Black Flag Week</a>. I am doing it a little early because I will be traveling for the next few days and will be away from the computer. You can make your own blog's stylesheet go black, put a banner on your <a href="http://achievingourcountry.blogspot.com/">index page</a>, wear a black arm-band or do something else that suits you. The point is simple enough: Pakistan needs a return to Law now that the elections have happened and the people have spoken. You can follow the issue at <a href="http://fastrising.blogspot.com/">Fast Rising</a> and <a href="http://www.teeth.com.pk/blog/">Teeth Maestro</a>. Help spread the word.</p>
<p>2. I need your help in writing a paper on dissent. I need any and all examples of jokes, poems, puns, satire of Musharraf that you might have received via email, sms messages, or however else. The deadline is kinda short so, if you ever want to pay me back for all the words I done wrote for you; now is the time. Details on the paper, and an acknowledgment of your contributions, will follow soon.</p>
<p>3. I will be in Lahore for the next two weeks. Posting will be light to non-existing. But, look forward to _tons_ of new visual material after my return.</p>
