  content: |-
    A comprehensive rating system is in order. It shall be based on a five monkey-head scale to measure the likelihood of one of these fruitcakes eventually going apeshit. For instance, Rabbi Meir Kahane, Pat Robertson and Mullah Hosein would each recieve four monkey heads. Pope John Paul II, The Dalai Lama and some reasonable Muslim cleric (I live in the US and therefore have never heard of one, but I'm sure he exists somewhere) would each get a monkey head, but only because they take thier faiths seriously. A clergyman like Al Sharpton, whose Bible's pages have likely merged via entropy, would not make the scale. In this way we can quickly and objectively, without ad hominem attacks, warn the world away from these high octane wingnuts.

    Also, I think "ad hominem" attacks are very useful. Sometimes, if you don't use them, you must  actually treat asinine arguments. That's not worth  your precious time, Sepoy. In strict rhetoric, it's not "ad hominem" to call a thing by its name, especially when it has become indistinguishable from its argument. It is, however, impolite to speak the truth plainly, espeically in academia.

    When my daughter finally asks me about the Nazis, I'm going to tell her Hitler was one of history's more colassal assholes and anything associated with him now or then is to be treated like a rag soaked in catpiss.

    Of course, I plan to say the same thing about a few ex presidents, a couple of UK prime ministers, most South American heads of state, most modern philosophers and authors, especially Dan Brown, all television stars and popular musicians and Vu Tran.

  content: It's good that Trinidad rejected the village, but your quote doesn't mention
    smoking. You would think that they would have to smoke *something* to keep their
    mind off of the fact that they really, really have to pee (if toilets are unclean,
    I'm wagering trees are too).

  content: I happen to agree with the "manic mullah." A Muslim village will do wonders
    for people whose values run opposite to so called liberal and profane trends of
    today. If people can prance around naked on the street and make alcohol available
    for general consumption, why can't others do the opposite. We all should have
    the right to islands of public sphere that suit our taste. And that the mullah
    is asking for his share in isolated village settings is kudos to him. I dont understand
    what the bitching is about. You all are welcome to contract aids and lose your
    self respect in the cities as you like. One wonders who is more intolerant, chapati
    face or the mullah.

  content: "The newspaper reported that my proposed Muslim Village would be for Muslims
    only. Yet the text of the report of my talk in the very newspaper made mention
    of my insistance that non-Muslims be welcome to live in the village on the condition
    that they are not hostile to Islam and that they respect our norms of public conduct.  The
    newspaper report also declared that there would be no toilets in the Village.
    Yet I said that toilets in the Village would be either detached or semi-detached
    from dwelling homes.  It is, I believe, too much to expect of those who
    use their wealth to buy and control newspaper publishing houses, that they would
    ever allow accurate reporting of news in matters that pertain to Islam. They fear
    Islam more than they fear their own shadow.   As for the declaration that
    the proposal for the establishement of a Muslim Village was rejected, that also
    was false. There are many people in Trinidad, Muslims, Hindus and Christians,
    who have indicated their desire to live in such a Village.  Imran N. Hosein"

    This is a free world. Everyone in this world has the right to bring new ideas,
    philosophies, systems etc. When you can tolerate people who introduce exploitative
    systems like excessive taxation, insurance business, usury, legalizing lottery,
    gay lifestyles, veganism, vegetarianism. Then what is so wrong with Maulana Imaran
    hosein's ideas. After all, he wants to establish a place were likeminded people
    can live their lives following their ideals. You might laugh at his denunciation
    of using toilets but think about this. Is not in the health circle, they talk
    about doing things naturally, using organic natural ingredients etc? There is
    already a group of people who grow grass on their roof tops since the \"green
    roof\" provides much more heat/cold than artificial systems. It is not difficult
    to understand to defecate in open air is much healthier than in the environment
    of poisonous gases in the enclosed toilets.   Don't throttle new ideas.
    Don't be so narrow minded. Taking a step back in life is not necessarily anti-progress.
    People are now going back to original ways of growing crops. They are fed up with
    chemical infested ones"

  content: "For those of you who have posted comments on here not just presenting
    your opposition to  the much respected Sheikh Imran Hosein but actually making
    a joke out of certain comments of his that were most certainly taken out of context
    should first and foremost try and ascertain the truth behind what you read and
    see. Much of what Sheikh Imran Hosein teaches is hard for the majority of us to
    comprehend because we are all living and working for this world rather than the
    hereafter.   It may be that these vile comments were a result of denial,
    a denial of the true fact that we are most certainly living in the final age.
    \ It is easy to character assasinate someone when they have spoken the truth because
    it helps us sleep easier at night.  The thought provoking material presented by
    Sheikh requires a deep understanding and so my advice to any haters would be to
    please take a moment to reflect on the teachings of Sheikh Imran Hosein.  For
    those of you who have simply read one out-of-context article I strongly recommend
    you listen to a lecture delivered by the Sheikh."

    The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, has stated that a Muslim should
    never embarrass his Muslim brother or humiliate him, or speak ill of him behind
    his back. If you do not agree with Maulana Imran's view of establishing a Muslim
    Village, you should have a discussion with him privately instead of using this
    website as a means to embarrass and insult him. You should be ashamed of yourself!

  content: "I only recently heard of Maulana Imran hosein from one of the pak alert
    \ emails. I listened to his lecture about dajjal , and honestly , since yesterday
    I have not thought of anything else . I was quite impressed by the way he explained
    the hadeeth about the dajjal . what I don't agree with is that Jesus will be
    sent down again. Many Muslim scholars have confirmed that the awaited messiah
    was Mohammed(saaw) and that jesus died. If Mohammed (saaw) is khatim al anbiya
    ,how can Jesus come back after him? I think these ahadeeth are compiled by
    christians to prove that jesus is after all \"the son of God'????? I am a clinical
    pharmacist, but am an avid reader and have travelled all over the world, not Trinidad
    ,unfortunately. I am hardly the expert to comment on the honored maulana's
    lecture, but as any educated Muslim , I would be honored if the Maulana explains
    how jesus can come after Mohammed(saaw), the saviour and master of this world
    ? According to Sheikh Deedat , Jesus is supposed to be dead and buried in Kashmir.
    The Quran says ,\"  wa itwafaina\" ie we finished his life, about Jesus.How is
    he raised alive again? I think he will be raised as all humans ,yom al qiyamah?  As
    for Mr. Chapati, how rude of you to twist the sheikhs words. In Europe there
    were no bathrooms or toilets up to the nineteenth century, they learned to bathe
    and have toilets from the Muslims. In England, people used to defaecate on
    the rooftops(yuck).  up till now the westerners do not wash themselves after
    relieving themselves, how clean is that? Just because the west decided that
    toilets should be inside the house, we decide the same?What a wannabe you are
    Mr. Chapati! What is wrong about a Muslim Village? I would love to live in
    one. If you can have Jewish, mormon, Aamish villages, how did Muslim Villages
    become so wrong? I lived in total comfort in Toronto with a great job, house
    and loads of money, after I got my daughter ,I decided to move to Dubai(24 years
    ago) when I felt it was the right place to bring up my children. I lived in a
    little house with a semi detached toilet, and have brought up my children far
    away from the dirty western schools. Mr. Chappati,you are so DENSE and narrow
    minded, also a liar, I must say!"

    kind of ppl there are in this world who try to press msgs which could change,

    possible way. well you said that Prophet Jesus DIED, point me out one place that
    stated that Prophet Jesus died. no he was taken up to heavens, and ever since
    awaiting his arrival. Y, Y is he arriving, as u said then the Christians will
    say "na auzbillah" he is the son of God. well my dear he will come to tell everyone
    first that he is not the son of God but a Prophet sent upon the ppl of Rome and
    jews, after his arrival when ppl will tell him to lead the friday prayer he will
    tell Imam Mehdi to come forth and lead us to the friday prayer, this will intern
    change the perception of all ppl about Prophet Jesus and will understand how can
    a prophet prey behind a man, he will then to everyone that i m not a God or Son
    of God but a Prophet of God to pass his message to the ppl here and lead them
    to sovereignty,

    misquoted him, I don't know why the motive, but only Allah knows. The Sheikh
    never said the muslim village will have no toilet. The quran warn us to verify
    information before we pass them on.  This is What Sheikh Hosein said: (paraphase)
    He was refering to the sunnah of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with him) and
    the traditions of muslims prior to this so called civilize world. He mentioned
    that the toilet were always kept detached from the house, because the toilet contains
    filts, therefore angels do not enter such places. If angels don't enter toilets
    when its outside, bringing it inside is just the same. Therefore, he said the
    muslim village will build toilets detached from the houses where people live,
    eat, sleep and pray. Please get your fact right. Whether you agree with the sheikh
    or not, you must make available the correct saying before jumping to conclusion.  May
    Allah All Of Us Ameen"

  content: "To the Person who has written this article,  I would like to first
    state that you do not qualify to judge such a great scholar as a matter of fact
    you are nothing more than an uneducated person trying to argue your point across.  You
    see, this man whom you are speaking of has a doctorate degree in many fields including
    economics. I am a masters student in the same field, and can assure you that from
    an economic perspective this man is 100% on the right track with every claim he
    stated and I will tell you why you ignorant piece of foreskin.  If you have
    followed through his lectures, and understood how money was created from ancient
    times, and how it evolved from being a barter exchange world into a monetary system
    than you would not be talking at the moment. All this man is stating is that the
    system, or matrix we live in today was created based on fraud. Its structure is
    not a strong one for it to last, in other words it is bound to collapse. The Quraan
    speaks of Riba being haram and some hadiths explain to you why it is so.  
    The creation of Englands central bank, and a new ideology of lending money on
    interest is the main cause of the problems of the world economies today, ask any
    economist who has knowledge of how markets shift and the history of economies.
    Since the creation of the Bretton Woods agreement as a fig leaf to hide the fact
    that paper could now be printed and used as money without any requirement that
    it be redeemable in the market in real money hence no intrinsic value, it paved
    the way for the establishment of the IMF with the explicit function of maintaining
    an international monetary system of precisely such non-redeemable paper currencies.
    By a policy prohibiting any link between gold and paper currencies other than
    the US dollar, it paved way for a delay in a country's recovery from an economic
    crisis and retard economic growth thus furthering economic and political stability.
    Countries were trapped with huge loans with money that constantly had no value.
    This new paper money system facilitated the banking system through fractional
    reserve banking to lend on interest money it did not possess or in words you can
    maybe understand LEGALISED FRAUD. The elimination of foreign currency restrictions
    would then expose a targeted currency to financial attacks that would create opportunities
    for windfall profits as the currencies lost value.  So this system emerged
    out of the Bretton Woods agreement succeeded in imprisoning the masses in the
    prison of permanent poverty and sometimes destitution. It could also be 90% proven
    that inflation is caused by manipulation of the money supply and not by forces
    of demand and supply as we have been preached about in schools and universities.
    Riba, money on interest is the source of the problem we are in today, and it the
    world followed proper banking according to the sunna, not modern day \"Islamic
    banking\", than the world would not  be in this situation. Moreover, when the
    electronic money, or currency that is soon to be the replacement of the current
    monetary system in the world, comes forth such would wheel in its wake financial
    slavery.   You must be a ignorant not to see how this man is proposing a
    solution to the problem when the real crisis kicks in and martial law and famine
    arises in countries. You are not even worth an explanation for you are nothing
    but a self-centered uneducated brain washed slave of the system who believes that
    you are living in a green world. I hope you one day get to where you want, and
    buy the Ferrari that you've been dreaming of all your childhood, and soon realize
    that you are living in a fraudulent mafia controlled world and loose everything
    and get thrown on the street.  WAKE UP, and go research and gain more knowledge
    about the issue before you go on criticizing people who have dedicated their lives
    to studying the matter. As i said nothing but a piece of foreskin."

    not want to offend your sensibilities as I can clearly see what happens to people
    who dare it. But I can not resist to ask, Is it the consensus policy of the group
    following  Maulana Hosein, to call people names who happe n to have different
    views about things or  was it your personal preferance. Also I would like to know
    if there was any precedence for such behaviour in Quran,Ahadith or Sunnah or for
    that matter in the Masters for economics curriculum.  Best regards Muhammad

  content: "How can anyone dare to call Imran Hosein a great scholar, when his book
    \"A Muslim Response to the Attack on America\", he advances the bizarre notion
    that the 9/11 terrorist attack was staged by Mossad.  And what words did
    Imran Hosein have for those moderate Muslims who recognized that the Taliban regime,
    which denied women all forms of basic medical care, and Osama bin Laden, leader
    of al-Qaeda, responsible for a previous attack on the World Trade Center, were
    not representative of Islam, and that the fact that the U.S. is not a predominantly
    Muslim country should not prevent it from defending itself from attackers who
    profess Islam?  \"The most dangerous and obnoxious of all creatures on the
    face of the earth today, or the most evil people beneath the sky, are those scholars
    of Islam or Muslim leaders who were totally deceived by the September 11th act
    of terrorism and who responded to it by blaming Arabs and Muslims for the attack
    and by extending patriotic support to Britain/USA/Israel in their war against
    Islamic Afghanistan. Usama bin Ladin and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan were
    completely innocent of that September 11th attack. The war against them on this
    account is manifestly unjust. Such misguided Islamic scholars and leaders ought
    to be universally condemned.\""

    you have watched all of his Lectures you might understand Especially a Lecture
    called \"Prophet Muhammad and the World today\" it is available on youtube to
    watch. I really think we need more people like him than most of the other \"spineless\"
    scholars of Islam. At the end of time there will not be many people who are Wise
    even though there is a lot of knowledge said in one Hadeeth. When Islam was attack
    on 9/11, the Media really had a Field day covering stories of islam (mostly lies)
    and Guest who collected money to buy Newspaper article pages to Respond to the
    Monstrosity attacks on Islam on a huge scale??"

    site plainly states \"His posts are often smug and superior in tone but you should
    forgive him. He is just an academic, after all.\"  In this case he appears
    to have authored his view based upon incomplete information. He, like all of us,
    is also human and can make mistakes. The informed few have clarified the Imam's
    actual message and it is time to move on.  No one is being forced to move
    into the proposed commune or prevented from joining in. Let's hope it will be
    a source of tranquility and not be one like Jonestown massacre  in 1978 or David

  content: "For starters, should you name God you will lead people to bringing that
    God n embarrassment and disgrace. Whatever you name the religion that has named
    the God, it will hold true. That does not mean that the sages among men, even
    those on opposing sides are devoid of all truth, even on whatever grounds their
    merit can be challenged.  Someone in the postings invited us to hear what the
    man actually said. Now considering we are in the country where a man can say he
    served on a Senate Subcommittee Debating on whether the internet should be released
    to the public, and has since quoted him falsely as claiming to have invented the
    internet. Good luck getting folks to listen to what was actually said pilgrims
    of the world, good luck.  So when you hear the Mossad accused of staging
    911, it certainly looks like someone did. Two magic airplanes without the fuel
    capacity to melt concrete and steel by the megatons, crumbling that much mass
    of even dry dirt, is less believable than a magic bullet multi-targeting from
    a Texas bookhold. We know the provided answers dont make any sense.   Hosien
    cant be completely nuts he want his village bathrooms built far from the kitchens.
    I would have see some plain spoken logic in that. He may very well present a truth
    about the Mossad.  The Mossad has tried to raid the Mexican Congress. Plainly
    they arent sweeties we need to protect and shelter as Americans, the sooner we
    stop sheltering them the sooner the problem of Muslims as hostiles toward the
    US will go away."

    we Muslims are busy fighting with 'Toilets' and so on lolz!    Overall I
    say Sheikh Imran is giving some solution for us to think about, right?  Did he
    say anything EVIL? Did he say negative things like 'Dont Establish A Muslim Village,
    Don't help Palestine, Follow the way of Dajjal, 9/11 is done by Muslims, Dollar
    is Not crashing so Invest In the Dollar,  Sea of Galilee is not drying up, the

  content: "Imran Hosein advocates the Muslim Village yet says Caliphate. Muslim village
    according to him can contain Hindus when Dar Ul Islam does not allow Hindus, only
    allows Christians and Jews. Further Caliphate advocates Dar Ul Islam and Ahle
    E Kitab allowed to live if of the Book, but must pay Jizya. Hindus cannot pay
    Jizya in Dar Ul Islam envt. So this is hypocrisy right there.  He also says
    work of surgeon is Dajjal, cutting in half and bringng back to life. That hadith
    only apply to Jabal Al Habshi. So my masjid ka imam is alive from dajjal fitna?
    He memorized Surah Al Kahf and anyone who memorizes Surah AlKahf is saved from
    fitna of Dajjal. And modern medical treatment originated from work of Muslims,
    Ibn E Sina's works are still used, in fact modern western society advocates Islam
    founded modern medicine and first medical school was in Iraq  I WILL CHALLENGE
    YOU TO A DEBATE IMRAN HOSEIN. COME OUT IN OPEN. IF ALLAH WILLED IT HE WOULD HAVE
    ALLOWED YOU TO FLY OVER USA BUT HE STOPPED YOU AND EVEN IN USA MUSLIMS DON'T CARE
    WHAT YOU SAY. ALHAMDULILAH WE ARE SAVED FROM YOUR FITNA IN WEST."

<p><img src="/img/mullah.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Here I do my duty as a sane human being by pointing out the absurdity that is the very <a href="http://www.info786.com/maulanaimran.htm">prolific</a>, Islamic scholar <a href="http://members.tripod.com/irif/nuflash.htm">Maulana Imran Hosein</a>. Let me just note what this particular 'alim wants to do: Establish a <a href="http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=30315245">Muslim village</a> in Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of the plan yesterday Maulana Imran Hosein said it was born of the need to protect and preserve Islam from the ills of society such as alcohol, fornication, adultery, illegitimate children, homosexuality, lesbianism and murders.<br />
He said there would be no mansions and since toilets were considered unclean places, buildings in the village will have no toilets.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Islam is this? This pure, antiseptically clean Islam that shuns toilets? The proposer of this grand idea is the ex-khateeb of Friday sermons at the United Nations mosque in Manhattan. He lived in NY until Sep 2001. You can read his <a href="http://www.onejamaat.com/page2.asp">brilliant take</a> on that as well. </p>
<p>I do not like ad hominem attacks. I hate calling people names. I do not believe that anything is served by me calling this guy a wacko. He can believe the Martians are responsible for Islam's woes. I do not care. But this guy has a following. People listen to him. Heck, all the people praying at the UN mosque listened to him for 10 years. And he is espousing such bigoted hatred, such millennialism as some Grand Elder of Islam. That is why I believe it is crucial to point out the absurdity of his claims. To be fair, the Muslim community in Trinidad has <a href="http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=30449869">rejected</a> this village with no toilets, murder or smoking. But what to do about Imam Hosein? Should we have a public rating system for Imams? Less than 2 stars and you are OUT. sigh.<br />
At the very least, we can expose them for what they are.<br />
