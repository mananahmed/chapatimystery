  content: Operation against Shiite in Fallujah was nothing but just mass killing!!
    A friend of mine returned the other day from Fallujah, and she told horrible stories
    about ONE SINGLE US SNIPER, who around killed 160 women ALONE!!!! in the streets
    !!  I think the situation now will be even worse than ever before. Just look,
    sucide bombing everyday!!

<p><a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20040416.wpsyop0416/BNStory/International"> Blasting loud rock</a> (what, no LimpBizkit?) and insults at the Fallujah uprisers is the current state of psyops in Iraq. </p>
<div id="blockquoted">At night, the psychological operations unit attached to the Marine battalion here sends out messages from a loudspeaker mounted on an armored Humvee. On Thursday night, the crew and its Arabic-language interpreter taunted fighters, saying, &ldquo;May all the ambulances in Fallujah have enough fuel to pick up the bodies of the mujahadeen.&rdquo;<br />
The message was specially timed for an attack moments later by an AC-130 gunship that pounded targets in the city. Later, the team blasted Jimi Hendrix and other rock music, and afterward some sound effects like babies crying, men screaming, a symphony of cats and barking dogs and piercing screeches. They were unable to draw any gunmen to fight, and seemed disappointed.</div>
<p>It seems like a weird tactic (do the insurgents even <em>know</em> english?) designed to provoke more than prevent. But that seems to be the modus operandi in Iraq. There is no attempt at all to connect to the Iraqis as people with a proud heritage who have yet to achieve their freedom. The tactics of war are good for just that: war. You cannot have a peace and reconstruction mission carried out by marines and soldiers. They are trained for something <a href="http://electroniciraq.net/news/1444.shtml">else</a>.<br />
Fallujah is a fiercely tribal place that will answer only with aggression. Wiser heads than mine, <a href=http://www.juancole.com/2004_04_01_juancole_archive.html#108209775381250582">Juan Cole</a>, have written on the need for temperance and restraint in Fallujah.<br />
Here is another account of a <a href="http://www.blogjam.com/wires/index.php?p=19">briton in Baghdad</a> pointing out the absurdity of peace-keeping with military tanks.<br />
All this is, rather, academic. Iraq has toppled into the chaos that was predicted before the war. Bush/Blair are leaving come July. Iraq belongs to the Iraqis. Afghanistan belongs to the Afghanis. We have done our job. To give them freedom.</p>
