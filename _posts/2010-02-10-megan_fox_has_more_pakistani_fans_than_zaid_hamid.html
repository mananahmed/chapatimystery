  content: "more hilarity: neither Megan Fox nor any hot laydeez appear in the top
    ten fan pages for Turkey.  Instead, we have: Mustafa Kemal Atat&Atilde;&frac14;rk;
    football team; another football team; Hz. Muhammad (pbuh); the Turkish Flag; Atat&Atilde;&frac14;rk
    again (sans given names); yet another football team; a deceased but beloved comic
    actor (male); a popular television serial based on The Count of Monte Cristo;
    and finally (wait for it) ATAT&Atilde;&oelig;RK (the allcaps version).\r\n\r\nI
    leave the drawing of conclusions as an exercise for the reader."

    countries then Megan Fox. Do we have a new envoy of peace? I think so.

  content: "As many of you know, analysis of pooled data from social networking sites
    and search engines is a hot field, already being used by public health authorities
    to track diseases (http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMp0900702) and
    (no surprise) by smart companies to track new trends and find new ways to make
    money.  I know that part or most of this particular discussion is in jest, but
    is there serious use of such data in your areas of academia?\r\nTo the extent
    that Sepoy wished to imply something serious in this post, can we assume that
    he believes that Pakistan is a \"normal country\" with \"normal people\", who
    really do spend more time with Megan Fox than the prophet Mohammed and Zaid Hamid?
    Are any of the anti-imperialists on the list shocked by the implications of this?
    Or has everyone already accepted our ironic modern world as being the norm and
    regards projects of establishing the United States of the Ummah as little more
    than \"politics by other means\"? Just curious..."

<p>Hasan demands that this headline exist somewhere, and so it does. <a href="http://fanpageanalytics.com/countryprofiles.html#location=Pakistan">Here</a> is a  statistical analysis of over 210 million facebook accounts which one can query by country etc. Pakistan's lists of group likes are quite instructive: Vin Diesel, for example, beats out the Prophet Muhammad. "I really hate slow computers" tells you something more. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-10-at-9.12.29-AM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2010-02-10 at 9.12.29 AM" width="548" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4561" /></p>
<p>Pakistan's aggregated Likes contain nothing along "national" lines. Contrasted, with Afghanistan, which has "Afghanistan", "Pushto", "Pushtuns", and local figures like Sardar Muhammad and Ahmad Zahir etc. India has the iconic national hero Zoozoo. Also, look at the relationships between Pakistan and US and further notice the lack between Pakistan/Bangladesh/India/Afghanistan. Bangladesh is the only country with a noticeable graph towards India. </p>
<p>And we are done.</p>
