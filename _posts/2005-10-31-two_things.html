<p>1. <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/2.html">Cliopatria</a> will be hosting the First Annual <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/17605.html">Cliopatria Awards</a> for History Blogging. Nominations are now open. I am one of the judges for the Best Individual Blog and Best Post categories. You cannot nominate me, if you had such a desire, for those categories. Please go and nominate blogs, bloggers and blogposts. We need a really strong South Asia representation. </p>
<p>2. I have been asked to participate in a conversation "to encourage academics with expert knowledge and a distinctive voice to use blogs and other internet-based vehicles to step beyond the boundaries of the academy to reach out to a broader public audience." This conversation is hosted by the fine people at the <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/">Institute for the Future of the Book</a> at the USC [their <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/">blog</a>]. Please go read their <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/sidebar/">statement</a> and tell me what you think. Obviously, this is a subject near and dear to my heart - since the only reason this blog exists is that I cannot imagine a scholarship that is not engaged with the public and political. But, that's just me.  </p>
<p>3. The leaves peeking in through my window look like heaven. This last item is a bonus item.</p>
