<p>Friend break-ups are usually painful, lonely affairs. But on September 13, 2015, a young man from Gujranwala, Pakistan, took the unusual step of publicly announcing on a social media network he was no longer best friends with one Mudasir, and had moved on to a new friendship that showed more promise, with a fellow by the name of Salman. Whether it was out admiration for Asif's boldness in making such a personal announcement so public, or for his unique skills in graphic design, or for his innovative use of language, coining as he did the term 'proudy' to describe his former friend, the original break-up announcement was 'shared' all over the world, and went 'viral,' attaining eventual 'meme' status. A month later saw a stunning turn-around in the fortunes of the two young men torn asunder by the proudy behavior of Mudasir: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/imaansheikh/a-rendezvous-with-asif">Asif announced that they were reunited</a>, and that he now enjoyed the company of two best friends, both Mudasir AND Salman. This portrait has been rendered to pay homage to the journey of that friendship, because, as Asif <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/friendship-is-all-about-compromise#.sf3gDLkZL">has written</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friendship is not a toy to play, if we consider it a toy to play, then we play with hearts in the name of friendship... friendship is the name of faith, the life is with the friends, I think that the life is nothing without friends...</p></blockquote>
