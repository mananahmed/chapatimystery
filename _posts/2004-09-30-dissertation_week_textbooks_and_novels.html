    It's sad to see disseration week end... it's been fascinating, great stuff.

    I was wondering if you might happen to know what type of role MbQ played in the social memories of other Muslim ethnic groups in South Asia... Pathans, Kashmiris, Bengalis, UP muslims? And in particular how is MbQ conceived in the literature of post-Partition Indian Muslims? I dunno if these questions are covered inthe scope of your research, but I thought I'd ask anyways.

    I am greatly impressed by ur work and research on MbQ, I remeber having read MbQ in our history books as Hero, who had rendered great services for Islam and we had great inspiration for his leadership in his younger age.The arabs,and sub- continent historians narrate about him differet
    stories  ( some out of grudge )about his invasion and goverance of Sind,we just say that he was a muslim and his stay in Sind,though very short had some impression of Islam on the local community.
    The GM Syed likes Raja Dahir as his great ancestors like Egyptians  feel proud to call
    themselves " Sons of Pheron" These anologies may be right but people are reluctant to admit and admire the services of most of the great leaders of this world.
    I appreciate your efforts, research and study in depth on this subject of past history. that is our history. May Allah provide you the best opportunities, assist and guide you to achieve further excellences in your future plans. Amen

    that is a crucial debate as well.'

  content: hi, our national psyche has been permanently impacted by the islamization
    of our text books.In the context of 9/11 and hordes of amjad farooquis - their
    minds clouded with our glorious (sic) past, it is no wonder that there has been
    a huge backlash against minorities. nationalists carried a secular agenda. GM
    Syed's comment was in reaction to the assertion that MQB was a liberator. The
    real question is the basic psyche of the people - some have a long tradition distinct
    liberal voices - some endorsing the rulers and the rightwing values they espouse
    and this division between the left and the right is not unique to south asia

    It confirms the conviction that history has an agenda. It makes me wonder, should
    history be judged by the effects that it might have on people!

    It is the un fate of history that every invader intered in sindh with force of sward behind the curtain of sweet slogan.

    M.B.Qasim was one of those. He captured many girls belong to the family of Raja Dahar and sent to Iraq as a gift.

    We are not think that they were daughters of only Raja Dahar but  they were daughters of soil and no on has right to play with the honour of others

<p><img src="/img/mbq3.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6></a>My final post is about my final chapter. I deal with textbooks and novels before and after Partition. It is not easy for a historian to deal with novels, especially one trying to figure out "social memory". Do the novels represent anything more than the solo novelist or market forces? I only hedge my bets here. I have some theory but who wants theory on a blog, eh? Don't answer that, really. </p>
<p>From the mid 1970s, a dominant theme of unification and Islam arose in all the discourse of the state. Even the secularist Bhutto, sought to rally the people around the twin green flags (Pakistan and Islam). Two events shaped this: The dissolution of One Unit, in 1970 by General Yahya Khan and the bitter secession of Bangladesh, in 1971. A nation tied together by strings of faith - Islam - and language &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&plusmn; Urdu &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&plusmn; was challenged on all accounts by regional calls to sovereignty and national calls to own up to its Islamic <i>raison d'etr&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&nbsp;</i>. Not to mention the horrific reality of being the aggressors where they once claimed victimhood. The idea of Pakistan, nebulous to begin with, started to disintegrate: Sindhu Desh, Wazirstan, Baltistan, Siraikistan.</p>
<p>It was against this back-drop that the state of Pakistan embarked on a  comprehensive project to produce a streamlined history of the nation and to have that history taught at all levels and in every province. In a collective such as Pakistan, which seeks its legitimacy in a universal ideal of Muslim identity and politics, the state had to provide an unsullied history of the nation that performed both a spatial and a temporal jump to reach its goal: to consistently and constantly negotiate a shared past amongst the Sindhi, Punjabi, Balochi,  Muhajir and other ethnicities. It appeared to the State that only history could provide the rationale for nationalism.</p>
<p>A particular history of the nation was disseminated in official discourse, school textbooks, nationalist novels, and public commemorations to explain the ancestral and ideological formation of the citizenry. I stress again that it was a conscious  policy of both the state and <i>Islamicist</i> organizations, primarily the <i>Jama'at-i Islami</i>, to dove-tail the history of the nation-state of Pakistan with the history of Islam - divorcing it from the history of the sub-continent among others. </p>
<p>That this was a practice started after 1971 is clear when one examines school textbooks from the 50s and 60s. In the higher grades, those textbooks mention Hindus in a neutral tone. In fact, they were critical of Muhammad b. Qasim. Under Zia, the process of "Islamization" eliminated all doubts from the curriculum. As a result, MbQ became the first model citizen of the state of Pakistan. The compulsory textbook for 9th & 10th grade proclaimed:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs under Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan in the early years of the eighth century, and established Muslim rule in this part of the South Asian sub-continent.  Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus valley.<br />
For the first time the people of Sindh were introduced to Islam, its political system  and way of government. The people here had seen only the atrocities of the  Hindu rajas... the people of Sindh were so much impressed by the benevolence of Muslims that they regarded Muhammad bin Qasim as their savior<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>In contradiction stood other regional accounts which cast doubts on MbQ and his contribution to Sindh. J. M. Saeed's mid-70s pamphlet <i>Sindh Jo Soomro</i> [Heroes of Sindh] had as the first hero, Raja Dahar:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">...On the one hand was such a generous Raja Dahar and on the other hand was the Muslim conqueror and general Muhammad b. Qasim. He was the one who attacked Sindh and enslaved 3000 men and women and sold them in foreign markets. He looted upto 400 million from the Sindhi treasury and send it to his country. He dishonored the guardian of Sindh, Raja Dahar, and his two daughters. Such a cruel and inhuman person cannot be celebrated as a Ghazi and a Mujahid. No one in this country should name libraries, colleges, roads, parks and institutions after him. All natives of Sindh should recognize that Raja Dahar is our  national hero and Muhammad b. Qasim is our national enemy.<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>It did not escape the attention of the state and Jama&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;at that Sindhi  nationalists had targeted MbQ as a villain. Their response was to hatchet up the indoctrination. A national day celebrating MbQ's victory over Raja Dahir was initiated. Novels were commissioned that centered on the heroic and brave struggles. Naseem Hijazi's 1948 <i>Muhammad bin Qasim</i> was reprinted into constant circulation. It was translated into Sindhi as well.  Novelists attached to the Jama'at incorporated both a strong Sindhi pride AND admiration of MbQ into their work. Editorials, series about "Heroes of Islam", used bits of MbQ history and large doses of national jingoism to brand MbQ the true warrior of Islam and "solely" responsible for the spread of Islam. </p>
<p>Last thing I want to point out is that I do not want to give you the impression that the memory of MbQ is contested only between two groups, the Sindhi nationalists and the State. There are other parties involved who have no horse in that race. Literature. MbQ does offer a uniquely tragic hero against whom all manners of romantic stories can be played out. My favorite is a re-working of the Sikh legend of <i>Sundri</i> who defied the Mughal king within a Sindhi context - in a novel by Khaleeq Murai, <i>Sundree</i>. Maybe sometime I can go more into that.</p>
<p>But really, this is it. Dissertation Week is OVER. My four readers of the blog are down to two. It happens at parties all the time, too. No sweat. CM will now resume the scheduled broadcast.<br />
