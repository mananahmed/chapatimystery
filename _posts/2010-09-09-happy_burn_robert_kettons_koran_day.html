  content: "Fundamentally, there is no difference. All of them are criticizing a religion
    that disagrees with their own religion (a Christian who talks about a book \"full
    of lies, fables and all abominations\" is pure comedy.  But I think the
    action of burning copies of the Koran is a necessary one. Muslims aren't up to
    speed when it comes to freedoms and this is as good a chance as any to force them
    to think about just how sacred this book really is. As an oppressed non-theist
    born in a Muslim country, I say burn them books until Muslims realize it is nothing
    but a book."

    the pastor in florida. he overplayed or pretended to hate islam and want to burn
    the qu'ran, but had no intention to do it. that's what i think anyway, and juan
    cole has some interesting things to say about it:  \"Jones, who can't
    seem to get even 50 people to follow him in Gainesville and is a nobody with a
    nasty stunt, is nevertheless getting millions of dollars worth of free advertising
    for his lunacy courtesy Time Warner, Newscorp, etc.\" http://www.juancole.com/2010/09/top-stories-more-important-than-quran-burning-nut-job.html"

<p>Robert of Ketton's <em>Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete</em>(The Religion of Mahumet, the Pseudo Prophet) was the one of the earliest Latin translation of the Qur'an, done under the aegis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_the_Venerable">Peter the Venerable</a> (d. 1156). It became the standard text, getting circulated and printed through the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Islam was long considered a Christian heresy but Ketton's translation (the first complete one) cemented the fullest pictures of this "death-dealing" religion for all Christendom. </p>
<p>The flowering of the panic about Islam in Europe, however, arrived after Vienna was besieged by the Ottomans in 1529. The Turks, made known in widely circulated genre pamphlets called <em> T&Atilde;&frac14;rkenb&Atilde;&frac14;chlein</em> were known to be kidnappers, rapists, murderers and determined to forcefully convert Christians to Islam. Though the <em>T&Atilde;&frac14;rkenb&Atilde;&frac14;chlein</em> were in circulation long before the siege of Vienna, they reached their bestseller-hood only in 1529 when Martin Luther wrote two, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iNM2NQAACAAJ">Vom Kriege wider die T&Atilde;&frac14;rken</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1Wc8AAAAcAAJ">Eine Heer predigt wider den T&Atilde;&frac14;rken</a>. In them the Turks, and Islam, were God's punishment from without (as the Pope was the devil within) who were heralding the end of days. The Latin translations of the Koran played a central role in this genre of books, feeding tiny bits of de-contextualized, glossed verses to build the case against Islam (It was a religion of blood-thirsty invaders intent on taking over the known world). Ketton's (and Mark of Toledo's) translations of the Koran made brisk printing business throughout the 1530s and 40s - even though they skirted the law against publishing heretical materials. One such case, for printing banned material, was made against the printer Oporinus in 1541, and to whose defense Martin Luther wrote a letter: </p>
<blockquote><p>It has struck me that one is able to do nothing more grievous to Mohammad or the Turks, nor more to bring them to harm (more than with all weaponry) that to bring their Koran to Christians in the light of day, that they may see therein, how entirely cursed, abominable, and desperate a book it is, full of lies, fables and all abominations that the Turks conceal and gloss over. They are reluctant to see the Koran translated into other languages, for they probably feel that it would bring about apostasy in all sensible hearts. ((Harry Clark, "The Publication of the Koran in Latin a Reformation Dilemma", <em>The Sixteenth Century Journal</em>, Vol. 15, No. 1 (Spring, 1984), pp. 3-12))</p></blockquote>
<p>Luther goes on to argue that despite the authorities concern about spreading heresy, the Christian cannot "take steps against its secret poison, preached on corners, and warn and protect the church". </p>
<p>I know that in popular parlance it is the Muslim societies which are "stuck" in Medieval Times &Acirc;&reg; (see <em>The Daily Show</em>'s hilarious segment on Iran from a day or so ago) but can you tell me what exactly is the difference between Martin Luther's take on Islam versus what is coming out of Sarah Palin or Florida Pastor Dude's mouth? I hate it when a "few bad apples" spoil modernity for the rest of us.</p>
