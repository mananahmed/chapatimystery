  content: "BLITZER: I don't know about you, but I keep hearing
    suggestions from some influential elements out there that what Iraq really needs
    is a strongman, someone not necessarily like Saddam Hussein who was a thug and
    a killer, but someone, let's say, like a Pervez Musharraf in
    Pakistan or a Hosni Mubarak in Egypt.\r\n\r\nWARE: Well, look, Wolf, you know,
    what we're talking about here is essentially what's
    dubbed the Musharraf option, precisely what you're talking
    about, putting a strongman in place.\r\n\r\nNow, this is something that was &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
    has been talked about and mooted (ph) since even before the invasion. It's
    now known that that was the CIA's preferred option for regime
    change. They said coup d'etat. Cut off the head, put in our
    own guy and then cut out the cancer of the Iraqi Baathist apparatus as we go.\r\n\r\nI
    certainly know very influential special forces commanders and other leading generals
    here in the country who have been pushing for solutions just like that since way
    back in 2004. (full transcript below the fold)\r\n\r\n(Unrelated but hilarious
    if not very tragic that US of A looking for a Musharraf option in I-RAK while
    there are winds of change in Pakistan.\r\nMA"

  content: "Ah glories of imperialism! Couple that with Clinton's comment that we
    need to replace Maliki - it warms my heart.\r\nThanks for that."

  content: enjoyed ambassador durrani's interview thoroughly, especially the part
    where he answers the question about whether the ISI knows the whereabouts of OBL.  nice
    bit of fielding.

<p>Leo Strauss ruined my graduate school experience and caused the Iraq War. Or maybe not? Chicago Reader <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/leostrauss/">investigates</a> the hidden imam of neo-conservatism. I blame Bernard Lewis, actually.</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Magazine TV interviewed some ambassadors of countries on their <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3865&page=0">Failed State Index</a>. You can watch Amb. Mahmud Ali Durrani <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3954&page=5">defend Pakistan</a>. "Don't blame us for everything", indeed. The news-junkies can also listen to a <a href="http://news.fletcher.tufts.edu/podcasts/2007/03/29/mahmud-ali-durrani-speaks-on-pakistans-role-in-the-war-on-terror/">podcast</a> by him on Pakistan and the War of Terrifying Terrors. </p>
