  content: Hi Sepoy. Although I think that the article on the whole is worth reading,
    I agree with your comment and have added two more criticisms on my blog. Particularly
    puzzling is the apprent contradiction between his pointing out the fatwas have
    failed and then suggesting that more action by clerics can turn back the tide
    of jihadism.

<p>Reza Aslan in <i>LAT</i> today: "<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-aslan16nov16,1,7883045.story?coll=la-news-comment">Islam has no equivalent of the Catholic tradition of excommunication, and the authority of the clerics to fight extremism is limited</a>". Um, <a href="http://www.culturekitchen.com/archives/002868.html">kafir murtadd</a>? Or ask  the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/ah/Ahmadiyy.html">Ahmadiyyas</a> how they feel about that statement.</p>
