<p>And here is a close up of the text for my persian readers.</p>
<p><center><img src="/img/ramayana2.jpg"/></center></p>
<p>In the spirit of Ramadan and holiness and neighborliness, above is an image from an early 17th century Persian translation of Valmiki's <i>Ramayana</i> from Gujarat. Interesting thing about this image is the calligraphical style which is made to emulate a Qur'anic manuscript - including the Bismillah across the beginning. To quote Jon Stewart, "Why do you argue, the two of you?" </p>
