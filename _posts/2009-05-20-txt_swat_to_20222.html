  content: I really don't understand your perspective, Sepoy. Who caused this bloodbath
    and humanitarian crisis, the Taliban or the state that opposes them? Do the Taliban
    express some authentic grievance? Are they somehow fighting for justice or national
    liberation in Swat? If not, then why do you oppose their military expulsion? Why
    reproduce the Taliban rhetoric that this is an American war, that, as you put
    it, "the American tax-payers need to see that military power in action against
    the TALIBOTHRA"? And don't you see that the situation has been made worse by the
    original agreement between the state and the Taliban, which you supported? Had
    that agreement never taken place, they would not be so entrenched and they would
    not have been to have their way with the people of the region for these last few
    months, killing or expelling their enemies. This situation was completely foreseeable
    then, which is why I strongly opposed the deal made with the Taliban at that time.
    After all, it was never "merely" about imposing the Taliban's brand of shariah
    law in the region, it was also about the Taliban's exercising of sovereignty in
    the region, i.e. a direct challenge to the Pakistani constitution, such as it
    is.

  content: "Spencer, I think the point is simply that if the Pakistani state is going
    to engage in large scale military action of this kind, it is counterproductive
    to do so without making provisions for regular folks (most of whom would also
    like to see the Taliban go).  The US certainly has an obligation here as well,
    given both our on-the-ground military posture in the region, and the rhetoric
    coming out of the Obama administration and major news outlets (not to mention
    the scattershot shenanigans of the Bushies).  All of these latter factors add
    to the pressure on the Pakistani state to intervene boldly... which only brings
    us back to the main point here.  Unless the Pakistani state and the Pakistani
    urban classes are also prepared to help shelter the IDPs, then leaving the humanitarian
    portfolio to groups like Jamaat-e Dawa only enhances the prestige of such groups
    in the eyes of people who need, above all, food, water, medicine, and shelter.\r\n\r\nI
    don't at all see how saying this \"reproduces Taliban rhetoric.\"  I mean, first
    of all, are you actually trying to suggest that United States bears no historical
    responsibility for the current situation?  Or that there has not been a ramping
    up of rhetoric coming out of the US suggesting that the only way to deal with
    the situation in Pakistan is militarily (either by proxy through the Pak state
    or remotely, with drones)?  Sure, Sepoy is being cheeky by labeling it the \"specter
    of Talibothra\" or whatever, but don't dismiss such factors out of hand as simply
    irrelevant to how events on the ground are playing out on the ground in Pakistan,
    and will continue to do so.  \r\n\r\nAs for the deal between the state and the
    Taliban a few months back, if you'll recall most of the local people in Swat,
    Buner, and environs weren't for it either.  They saw it as a capitulation on the
    part of the state, leaving them to fend for themselves.  The fact that now, after
    so much pressure from the Obama administration, the government IS launching a
    big offensive only exacerbates the impression that they (Zardari &amp; Co.) are
    more interested in what Washington thinks than protecting the local people against
    the Taliban.  You might disagree, and you're perfectly right to note that the
    Taliban started it, but that doesn't do anything for the people who have been
    sent fleeing with only what they could carry.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, back we are right
    where we started.  No one, Sepoy least of all, is denying that the Taliban are
    a bunch of knuckleheads who deserve to be driven the f**k out of Dodge.  So go
    ahead and blame them all you want.  What he's saying, as far as I can tell, is
    that it's no long-term solution to do so without a concurrent, sustained, humanitarian
    intervention that makes the people look to the state instead of Islamist parties
    for protection.  In fact it's worse than not being a solution -- it's a key part
    of the problem, and always has been."

  content: "Spencer,\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, albeit from afar, that there are
    Swati grievances (Look up the PDF at \"Swat Now\" at CM). I don't think that \"Taliban\"
    represent/express those grievances but that isn't to say that those grievances
    don't feed into militancy. \r\n\r\nI don't know if Sepoy means to say that this
    is an American war by saying,\"We, the American tax-payers, need to see that military
    power in action against the TALIBOTHRA.\" Sepoy would know better what he means
    to say. I think that our tax dollars have gone into the aid provided to Pakistan
    and the aid has been military. I have heard and read people say something to the
    tune of - Taliban are so many miles from Islamabad and Pakistan has nukes that
    can fall into Taliban's hands, and we have given Pakistan billions of dollars
    so why wouldn't the Pakistan army take action. In my opinion, such rhetoric comes
    at least partly from a desire, perhaps out of fear, to see \"military power in
    action against the TALIBOTHRA.\" \r\n\r\n\"Why reproduce the Taliban rhetoric
    that this is an American war\" - Actually that \"rhetoric\" comes from several
    other perspectives and not just from that of Taliban (whatever that may be). Marking
    such type of \"rhetoric\" as Taliban, can mean that the person producing such
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;rhetoric&acirc;&euro;\x9D is Taliban-sympethizer / closet-Taliban
    /\"Taliban-type\" or a Talib himself. Such wonton labeling of people as being
    in some way aligned with Taliban, is one of the ingredients that make Taliban
    the TALIBOTHRA (in my opinion). You could label the point I made as an apology
    for Taliban, and if you do, I could label your act as some form of McCarthyism,
    but this isn't grade school. My point is that \"Why reproduce the Taliban rhetoric\"
    sort of rhetoric leads nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe \"military expulsion\" from what I
    gathered, is being carried out by, as Juan Cole put it, invading Swat. So far
    the \"their military expulsion\" has expelled over a million people. This may
    produce and enhance the very threat that the military action is supposed to eradicate.
    \" 'I want to pick up a gun and fight the Taliban and the army,' says shocked
    Said Quraysh, shaking with rage as he erects a tent in a camp for civilians fleeing
    Pakistan's fighting.\" http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/pakistan+fury+at+civilians+dead%2C+homes+razed-rs
    \r\n\r\nApart from the possibility of enhanced militancy, mass migrations of such
    sort (http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-unwelcome-in-karachi-unable-to-return-qs-01
    ) in Pakistan's urban centers cause further turmoil, ethnic tensions being just
    one such problem, to be exploited by political forces. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7884222.stm\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    I don't think that \"Taliban\" is a monolith. Even within a certain area, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Taliban&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    are a loose umbrella grouping with rifts within. http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0510/p06s01-wosc.html
    \r\n\r\nI try to keep up with news and current affairs, but that isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    my primary vocation. So, no sarcasm intended, can you elaborate on \"Had that
    agreement never taken place, they would not be so entrenched and they would not
    have been to have their way with the people of the region for these last few months,
    killing or expelling their enemies?\" I thought Taliban were already well entrenched
    and this deal might help the government gain a better foothold in Swat http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7959100.stm
    . I can be totally wrong on this one, which is why I am asking for explanation.

  content: 'Spencer, you really must start checking your facts before expressing your
    opinion.  This latest comment is so ridiculous that I''m almost embarrassed on
    your behalf.  Note that ''facts'' are not the same as the propaganda spewed out
    by the media-military complex, American or Pakistani.  or Indian, or Israeli,
    for that matter.  The facts are:  the Taliban do not pose a serious (or even real)
    danger to the state or to the people of Pakistan.  The parallels between the anxieties
    of the liberal-left here and the liberal elite in Pakistan never ceases to amaze
    me, especially these days, and one of them has to do with this bizarre anxiety
    conjured up at the mere mention of the Taliban.  Something weird in the subconscious
    there (ooo, now you''ll tell me I''m not a real Marxist), which it would be fun
    to explore eventually.  I detest them myself and would hate for them to grab any
    power in Pakistan whatsoever, but that aint happening, so relax.   what IS happening
    is a real good drama being staged for the likes of you (and your counterparts
    in Pakistan) who can now rest assured that the Pakistani army is now doing the
    ''right'' thing.  Amazing how easy it was to restore the credibility of an institution
    that had just taken a royal drubbing from a committed pro-democracy movement.   But
    maybe you don''t like the idea of democracy in countries like Pakistan - so messy
    and ''unstable.  Also, how amazing to make people forget that the Taliban are
    the creation of the very institution that is now being praised for doing nothing
    more than creating the biggest humanitarian disaster since Rwanda.   Even assuming
    that the army WAS now interested in controlling these pawns it had created, do
    you usually use a sledgehammer to put in a thumbtack?   Which counterinsurgency
    manual have you been reading?  Oh - sorry - it''s probably the US military''s.  In
    any case, don''t you think the proof od the pudding is in the eating?  Let''s
    do the math, shall we?  Over a million people displaced, hundreds killed, the
    army now celebrated as the savior, and the Taliban still not consigned to the
    dustbin of history.  Wow.  Let''s celebrate this amazing achievement.'

    is displaced. From what I gathered, the population was 175K in 1998. That's just
    one town, although I think the largest in Swat. I remember reading last year that
    about 400K IDPs were displaced from FATA. More IDPs are on the way (http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/09-govt-begins-preparations-for-expected-waziristan-idps-szh--08
    ) as Army plans to extend the operation. \r\n\r\n\"In fact, the ruling ANP-PPP
    coalition in the province is already calculating that the figure of Internally
    Displaced Persons (IDPs) could rise to 2.5 million because the military action
    that it enthusiastically recommended is continuing and would definitely last longer
    than planned or anticipated. And if one were to take seriously the statement by
    our globe-trotting president about starting new military operations in the Federally
    Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) that includes the two Waziristan, we are bound
    to have many more IDPs living miserable life in the makeshift camps or in urban
    slums.\" ... \"In the heat of the moment, not much thought is being given to the
    political, economic and social fallout of such large military operations involving
    excessive use of airpower and heavy artillery in densely-populated mountain valleys
    with weak economies and fragile environment. All we hear are statements and slogans
    demanding more attacks so that the enemy is crushed once and for all. There is
    little tolerance for divergent opinion and anyone with a different viewpoint is
    condemned without realizing that we are supposed to be a democratic country..\"

    or the DRC, it probably does; relative to Saudi Arabia, it has a more progressive
    national school system.  I suspect Pakistan's is comparable to the national school
    systems of a number of developing countries (ahead of many; behind many).  This
    it is hard to \"[t]hink about\" the proposition when it isn't obvious what thought
    the proposition is itself the product of.\r\n\r\nRe: \" large number of inhabitants
    are serfs, because feudalism still thrives. in 2009!\"\r\n\r\nI agree with your
    suggestion that this is an atrocious situation.  But the \"in 2009!\" suggests
    that this sort of poverty and degradation is somehow alien to the present period.
    \ On the contrary, it is one of the abiding features of the modern-day world:
    all across South Asia, and in some other parts of Asia, one can find indentured
    labor that is, whether or not serfdom, highly un-free and exploitative.  One can
    find millions more such workers in Africa as well.  Not to mention the situation
    of both manual and domestic labor in the otherwise prosperous petrodollar economies
    of the Persian Gulf."

    months back, if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll recall most of the local people in Swat,
    Buner, and environs weren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t for it either. They saw it as a
    capitulation on the part of the state, leaving them to fend for themselves. The
    fact that now, after so much pressure from the Obama administration, the government
    IS launching a big offensive only exacerbates the impression that they (Zardari
    &amp; Co.) are more interested in what Washington thinks than protecting the local
    people against the Taliban. You might disagree, and you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re
    perfectly right to note that the Taliban started it, but that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    do anything for the people who have been sent fleeing with only what they could
    carry.\"\r\nMy whole point was that the people of the region were against it.
    ( Anyway, what would it mean to say, politically, that people \"want\" Taliban
    rule, so we should let them have it?). Given that the people of the opposed Taliban
    rule, it is fair to say that the Pakistani Army betrayed its responsibility to
    defend its citizens by making a deal with the Taliban. Those who apologized for
    that decision at the time cannot now in good faith profess their horror and outrage
    at the consequences that flow from it. As for the \"impression\" about Zardari's
    government being more interested in Washington&acirc;&euro;&trade;s approval,
    I don't see what difference it makes. At the end of the day, it's a Pakistani
    political crisis. American troops will someday soon leave Afghanistan. It's the
    people of these two countries that have to fight their political battles. If they
    don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t realize this fact and think instead that the issue is
    just about pleasing the U.S., it is only an index of the relative immaturity of
    the political debate (something unsurprising given the near total absence of leftist
    parties and trade unions in Pakistan). \r\nBabu also wrote: \"What [Sepoy&acirc;&euro;&trade;]s
    saying, as far as I can tell, is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s no long-term solution
    to do so without a concurrent, sustained, humanitarian intervention that makes
    the people look to the state instead of Islamist parties for protection.\" \r\nSure,
    but there is a military question. The Taliban are directly challenging the sovereignty
    of the Pakistani state and there is no way to settle the matter peacefully. They
    will have to be defeated or their demands will only increase. That much seems
    clear enough. Then there is issue of the more or less total incapacity of the
    Pakistani state to deliver social services to the refugees. Not only the limited
    resources of the Pakistani state but its highly retrograde class composition are
    objective constraints to any humanitarian effort on its part (because the resources
    will be diverted by corrupt bureaucrats, etc.). It doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    matter whether aid comes in the form of dollars or in commodities &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    in a capitalist economy the one is readily convertible to the other. In other
    words, grain, medicine, etc. will simply be misappropriated and sold for profit
    on the market, with the relevant officials pocketing the money. \r\nThe Pakistani
    state is built upon a history of oligarchy and betrayal. It is not in legitimacy
    crisis. It lacks legitimacy. Still, any successful democratic movement will have
    to democratize this failed state inherited from the past. It cannot hope for anything
    from the Taliban.\r\nSalman writes: \"I think that our tax dollars have gone into
    the aid provided to Pakistan and the aid has been military.\" \r\nTo this I would
    reply it isn't simply that the aid is military, but that the Pakistani state is
    a military state and is therefore incapable of efficiently providing for the delivery
    of any sort of humanitarian aid (without effectively suspending its own sovereignty,
    as happens in African countries where NGOs constitute a parallel state). Why should
    think the Pakistani government capable of distributing or supervising the distribution
    of aid when it cannot provide any social services to its people right now?\r\nSaadia
    wrote, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The facts are: the Taliban do not pose a serious (or
    even real) danger to the state or to the people of Pakistan.&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\nThis
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fact&acirc;&euro;\x9D is supposedly supported by the news
    reports? Apparently the political destiny of the Taliban in Pakistan is a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fact&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    that a journalist can establish! \r\nWhen you speak for Pakistani democracy, you
    identify the ground on which we disagree fundamentally. However much you wish
    to paint me as an uninformed State Department tool, I submit to you that the project
    of advancing Pakistani democracy cannot advance without and unless there is also
    a military conflict with the Taliban. It's not the only front in the democratic
    struggle, nor are the the Pakistani Army or NATO forces allies to be relied upon
    in the longue-duree struggle for Pakistani democracy. But to imagine that any
    secular democratic movement can gain a real foothold in Pakistani, i.e. that genuine
    organization of the urban working class can take place, while islamist guerrillas
    operate in the country is, to my way of thinking, misguided in the extreme. So,
    you see, I am arguing, rather, not against democracy, but for it. I am claiming
    that the struggle for greater democracy in Pakistan, a struggle that would ultimately
    challenge not only Islamization, but the bloated and blood-sucking military-bureaucratic
    establishment, the landlord class, and the bankrupt party political order. But,
    again and to repeat, any such movement would necessarily emerge in and through
    the defeat of the Taliban. So, you see, the issue is hardly one of celebrating
    imperialism. On the contrary, it's a matter, at least as I see it, of realistically
    assessing the political situation in Pakistan today on the basis of a fundamental
    commitment to democratic internationalism. \r\nMy view is that strategically the
    Lawyers Movement, say,  or the larger if more inchoate democratic movement in
    Pakistan cannot expand and grow without taking a side in the military struggle
    taking place.  I see bogus compromises as made with the Taliban in Swat as merely
    allowing the Taliban to consolidate and entrench themselves. It bespeaks fear
    and ambivalence on the part of the government and Army, and I for one am glad
    to see the struggle resumed, because the scale of the humanitarian costs, great
    as they are today, can in fact greatly increase. Compromise with the Taliban is
    only going to make things worse in the long run, because their demands are ultimately
    irreconcilable with democracy, secularism, and indeed civilized life in Pakistan
    and they will not rest satisfied until they implement their total program. Every
    day that the government continues to rest supine in the face of the Taliban challenge,
    the situation gets worse and Taliban grows stronger. This is why the subject of
    IDPs is secondary to the military issue - it is a crisis that flows from a war
    which the Pakistani government did not start, but which it must finish if there
    is to be any security that the population of Pakistan is not going to be further
    brutalized.  \r\nI certainly support criticism of the military tactics employed
    by the Army. Similarly, I support demands for IDP relief. But the fact remains
    that the Taliban have brought a war to Pakistan and I support the Pakistani government
    in its attempt to defeat them.\r\nSepoy writes: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;You fail to
    betray even a cursory understanding of realities on the ground - so wedded are
    you to your ideology. Be that as it may, you are factually wrong here: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;And
    don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t you see that the situation has been made worse by the
    original agreement between the state and the Taliban, which you supported?&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    I didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t support the agreement, I simply tried to point its
    legal and political history.&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\nWhen I read your posts they read
    like support for the government&acirc;&euro;&trade;s treaty with the Taliban.
    I stand by my interpretation of your comments at that time. And, indeed, at the
    time there were some who posted in response to you criticisms very much in the
    spirit of mine. \r\nAs for my familiarity with the realities on the ground, what
    are the realities of which I betray such ignorance and which so completely undermine
    my point of view? I am happy to be directed to consider new facts, new information
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but how am I to react to the blanket claim that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    know the facts? And what exactly is the ideology that you think me wedded to that
    renders me impermeable to these supposed facts? Do you think that if I went to
    an IDP camp in Pakistan and stared at &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the facts on the ground&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    it would tell me anything about how to politically assess the dynamics generating
    the historical outcomes today?"

    I can say is \"Ignorance is strength\"\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time in 1973 we had
    a left of center govt. in Pakistan. It nationalized all the banks ( Imagine your
    noble laureates are recommending to nationalize US banks now though temporarily,
    and land of Magna Carta has effectively nationalized its banks). The education
    was cheap, imagine  there were tens of medical colleges and other univerdities
    started. Books were free. In medical schools the fee was less than curent days
    english medium KinderGaartens in Pakistan. The regimen had its flaws. Still many
    feudals in key position but homeless farm workers were alloted land to buuild
    small houses to get them out of clutches of  Land owners and Induatrialists. But
    the regimen committed another cardinal sin of pursuing nuclear power. So one Henry
    Kissinger pronounced \"We will make you an Example.\" On  night  of july 3, 1977,
    Zia UlHaq ,then chief of Army Staff met with American Ambassador and on July 4,1977
    he declared Martial Law. He was respoding to agitation by PNA a collection of
    all Pakistani religious parties from JI to JU I, JUP and whatever, the progeny
    and protectors of most of present day religious parites. Some of those were thought
    to be on American payrole as dollars became cheap those days. So on July 4,1977,
    our national nightmare began. Rest is history any body who is not reading comprhension
    challenged and willing to take Ideological blinkers off , can  find it. Pakistan
    is some 170 million people. Majority of people do not trust America , do not trust
    Military(just recently in vote, Musharraf,s Kings party was trounced in elections),
    and majority is happy with Mullah conducting  the religious rites but not running
    the country. When you belittle Lawyers movement in country with 20 years of military
    rule with in 30 years space, you are showing a very suprficial understanding of
    the country you chose to bless with your advice.\r\nAlso you claim to understand
    \"Pakistani Values\". Can you elaborate on that as it might help advance some

  content: I know something already of the modern history of Pakistan. I would point
    out that if you despise the forces which the U.S. has done so much to foster in
    both Pakistan and Afghanistan from the Zia coup to the CIA backing of the mujahideen,
    then I don't understand why you don't applaud the significant change of course
    that has resulted in the Afghan War and the pressuring of the Pakistani government
    to de-islamicize. As I said before, I don't expect that the U.S. government (or
    any of the major political parties in Pakistan) to steadily and resolutely oppose
    what I take to be a kind of islamist fascism, but to the extent that they are
    fighting that battle now I don't object. As for the "Yanks" going home, this would
    not mean Pakistani autonomy, it would only mean other and perhaps less savory
    forces moving in to fill the vacuum - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and India
    - many of whom already exert a strong influence in the region. One positive development,
    as far as I am concerned, of the change of American policy in the region since
    9/11 is the re-orientation of the U.S. towards Indian aspirations and away from
    those of the Saudis. It may be resented by the ISI and the Pakistani military
    (as the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul last year made clear), but I think
    it very much in the long-term interests of the people of Pakistan.

    of Swat were sold out by their government? A land of peace and justice? \r\nThat
    said, I agree that this operation seems to be so barbaric as perhaps to be unworthy
    of support. It seems altogether possible that the Pakistani Army is as entirely
    incapable of expelling the Taliban from Swat as it was of defending it from them
    in the first place. Reading the reports certainly one despairs. To me, this is
    more evidence of Pakistan's being a failed state \"on the brink,\" etc., i.e.
    all the characterizations that many people here seem to object to so strongly.
    No doubt, it is the fruit of the terrible half-century tie-up between American
    imperialism and the Pakistani oligarchy. Still, it pains me to see it. \r\nI don't
    think that in the absence of a military defeat the Taliban will cease to destabilize
    the country, making it impossible not only for capitalists to invest, but no less
    certainly making it impossible for anything like a real mass democratic movement
    to emerge in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that if, as so many here
    seem to wish, NATO were to pack up and leave Afghanistan tomorrow, the result
    would be a regional catastrophe ending, in all likelihood, in a war with India
    that will, among other terrible effects, generate an internal refugee problem
    that will dwarf that resulting from the Swati operation. Again, unlike Sepoy and
    Saadia and many others here, I see great potential for the political, economic,
    and humanitarian situation in Pakistan to get much worse very quickly. Clearly,
    the Pakistani military is utterly ill-equipped to defend the country from this
    sort of threat. More importantly, unlike most, I see no organized political force
    capable of really reversing the political tide (and I don't think mere population
    or urban centers constitute a political obstacle to Talibanization)."

    about \"tribals\" and \"lowland Pakistanis\"? Can you take this stuff seriously?
    Is the Taliban some kind of expression of Pashtunwali? Is that Margolis expects
    us to believe? \r\nSatter in The News makes a point that many here should take
    to heart: \"In Pakistan, the US is accorded more credit and discredit for its
    ability to control events and decisions than is due. Our obsession with perceived
    US power manifests itself in two ways: one, as willing abdication of ruling elites
    to the whims and edicts of the US administration as an imperative to continue
    to enjoy power; and two, in the form of conspiracy theories based on the assumption
    that the US controls everyone from Zardari and Kayani to Fazalullah and Baitullah
    and that all our miseries are part of a grand sinister design of the US to break
    Pakistan up.\" The slavishness of the elite towards America derives precisely
    from the fact that their parties promise the Pakistani people no real alternative
    to the status quo. Of course, if there were a real radical politics in Pakistan,
    its leaders would not be Washington's toadies (though that would hardly be an
    important accomplishment). But one seriously wonders to what extent Satter would
    actually support the sort of radical movement necessary to break the dependency
    on the U.S.  that he bemoans."

    realities of which I betray such ignorance and which so completely undermine my
    point of view? I am happy to be directed to consider new facts, new information
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but how am I to react to the blanket claim that I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    know the facts\"\r\n\r\nSpencer: The \"Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan\" - your Taliban,
    who are not the same Taliban as in Afghanistan - were not a party to the Swat
    deal. The Swat deal was made between the political govt. of Zardari and the Sufi
    Muhammad's Tehrik-e Nifaz Fiqh Muhammadi, an organization and a demand that dates
    back to the late 80s/early 90s. They made the deal promising that they will control
    TTP. They failed. The deal failed. \r\nNow, this \"fact\" tells you two things:
    Swat has a long gestation of resentments towards the state of PK which have very
    little to do with the ideological Talibanization that you are so convinced will
    sweep Pakistan. Second, that even within Swat there are more than one type of
    \"bad guys\". While, I am sure from the point of view of a hammer, everything
    looks like a nail. I am, on the other hand, not interested in sacrificing civilians
    to neo-con agendas. Hence, my distrust of the military, the military action, or
    the US intervention. \r\n\r\nWhat I find remarkable in all of your comments is
    how little \"facts\" matter to you. You hold some specter of \"working class poor\"
    and \"Left\" as the necessary pre-conditions of democracy in Pakistan. Do you
    actually know anything about the political landscape inside Pakistan? Can you,
    for example, tell me the socio-economic make-up of typical political worker in
    PPP or in ANP or in MQM? You continue to stress that the major cities etc. will
    fall to the Taliban but you fail to point out how? How will it happen?\r\n\r\nI
    hate to continue this dialogue with you, since we have been going at it for some
    weeks. But explain this to me. Why hasn't Kabul fallen to the Taliban? Given your
    understanding of the rate of accumulation in Pakistan (10,000 take over 110 million
    or convert them or terrorize them), why hasn't that same calculus occurred in
    Afghanistan? I am specifically speaking pre-surge. In other words, why is it that
    Pakistan is deemed to fail (now), but Afghanistan is not flying the Taliban flag
    even after 5 years of minimal US/NATO troops and no major military operation.
    \r\n\r\nIf you care to be honest in your response, you will invoke ethnic and
    linguistic differentiations between the Tajik and Pakhtun populations in Afghanistan.
    So, lets cross over that Durand Line and tell me why \"Talibanization\" will flourish
    amongst Sindhis, Punjabis or Baluchis? Which isn't to downplay the sub-nationalist
    movements among those groups, either. But, you see how silly it begins to look,
    doesn't it?\r\n\r\nActually, I am sure you don't."

  content: "Sepoy, my point is and has been that the Taliban are part of a larger
    islamist political movement. As in Afghanistan in the 1980s there were many various
    and conflicting groups under the umbrella \"mujahideen,\" we can speak of the
    Taliban as a broad political movement in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There were
    numerous islamist (and leftist) groups involved in the overthrow of the Shah in
    1979. Khomeini had to maneuver both to left and right for years to finally assert
    his undisputed leadership over the Islamic Revolution there. Similarly, there
    were numerous groups on the right jockeying for hegemony in Germany in the 1920s
    and 30s. During the struggle with republic, they presented a united front. The
    mere fact of a plurality of groups doesn't really say much politically to my mind.
    The issue is what sort of politics do they share? How are they rooted in the same
    authoritarian psychology and ideological forms? This and only this sort of analytic
    understanding helps one to understand how they are linked globally not only to
    their fellow islamists in other countries, but, indeed, to their Christian, Hindu,
    and atheist fascist \"enemies.\"\r\nThe word \"neo-con\" doesn't scare me. But,
    certainly, unlike you, I don't share their preoccupation with \"Westernized\"
    middle classes as the supposed basis of democratic movements. \r\nAs for demands
    going back to the 1980s and 1990s, the situation changes with changing circumstances.
    Moreover, the demand was politically regressive then too. \r\nI don't say that
    major cities will fall to the Taliban, but that the government will acquiesce
    in Talibanization. The ascendancy of the Taliban will take a political not a military
    form. Did the cities \"fall\" when Zia came to power? The fact that the U.S. presumably
    backed the Zia coup and wouldn't support the takeover by a Taliban sympathetic
    military officer wouldn't be the most important aspect of the event, should it
    take place. In other words, you don't have to look to Afghanistan or Iran to imagine
    what islamization in Pakistan will look like. It's already got a strong legacy
    in the country. \r\nThe linguistic and ethnic diversity of Pakistan didn't stop
    the Muslim League's (regressive) demand for Partition in the 40s, it didn't stop
    the decades of military rule that followed, it didn't stop the prosecution of
    the Bangladesh War, it didn't stop Bhutto's (again reactionary) call for Islamic
    Socialism, and it didn't stop the Zia coup, so what makes you think the ethnic
    and linguistic diversity of the country is going to stop Talibanization, a movement
    that already has strong support inside the Pakistani state apparatuses?\r\nI think
    you are in some sense right that I consider the facts to be less salient than
    you do. Or, rather, I consider different kinds of facts to be the salient ones.
    \r\nRegarding Afghanistan, obviously the situation there is much worse than it
    is in Pakistan. In Afghanistan, entire populations continue to live under Taliban
    rule and the American invasion has done nothing for them, except perhaps ravage
    their country even further. But, unlike you, I see the two political-military
    contexts as deeply inter-related. \r\nAs for \"the socio-economic make-up of a
    typical political worker in PPP,\" etc., I dare say I understand the matter as
    well if not better than you do, though I understand it on the analogy of the operation
    of political parties in India, a matter which, I will remind you (since you lay
    such store by expertise), I have studied as a professional historian (and amateur
    field researcher) in India and which you have never studied professionally in
    Pakistan. Do you really think that the that \"the socio-economic make-up of a
    typical political worker\" in the Communist Party of India, the Shetkari-Kamgar
    Paksha, the Congress, or the Shiv Sena in Pune and Mumbai is particularly different
    from that of their counterparts in Karachi or Lahore?\r\nOf course, I think democracy
    in Pakistan will be built by the Left. Democracy has only ever been built by the
    Left in every country where it can be said to exist and I don't expect Pakistan
    will make an exception to the rule. I should point out that I use the terms working
    class and Left as normative, not as descriptive categories. Of course, there are
    parties and political movements chiefly composed of working class people which
    are fascistic or at least reactionary. The issue is one of program and mode of
    organization (and the relation between the two)."

    Partition was a major defeat for the Left in both India and Pakistan.\r\nAs for

    and Pakistan.\"  It's also easy to argue from present circumstances that Partition
    was the best thing to happen to India (as some commenters on a prominent South

    that demand was made and the insecurities of Indian Muslims at the time.  Anyway,

    in a democracy. I think most Pakistanis are very happy with capitalism, they just
    want to make money, educate their children and get ahead in life."

    have real fears, and concrete reasons for insisting on a regressive political
    position, but that is a separate issue from whether or not the political position
    is nevertheless regressive (I might add that the Muslim League was not only responding
    to the real fear of \"Hindu Raj\", but also stoking that fear, and by the end
    rather shamelessly, with no regard for the communal violence that was likely to
    ensue from its stance -- e.g. the way the League de-stabilized Khizr Hayat Khan's
    Unionist government in Punjab in 1946-47).\r\n\r\nRe: \"Jinnah and the League
    only demanded a seperate country after Congress rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan,
    which was the last compromise.\"\r\n\r\nOne might argue that the Cabinet Mission
    Plan (which enshrined a right of secession in the provincial groupings) was not
    much of a compromise, but in any event, that was not the rhetoric of the Muslim
    League.  There is the Ayesha Jalal view that seeks to assert that the demand for
    Pakistan was basically a bargaining chip and only a last resort, but no attempt
    is made to account for the rhetoric of the demand for Pakistan, which was certainly
    not that way.  That is, if such an absolutist demand was being made  \"insincerely\",
    given the communally charged context of India in the 1930s and 1940s, it was really
    the height of cynicism and irresponsibility.  [It's the sort of thing one would
    expect from a litigator, but does not make for sagacious politics.]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the above is off-topic, and obviously no-one (certainly not me) is suggesting
    that this should have any bearing on Pakistan's independence.  [Although the late
    Khan Abdul Wali Khan (ANP) was of the view that the this history was relevant
    to Pakistan's future troubles: i.e., his view was that Pakistan was a \"reward\"
    to the pro-Western Muslim League (i.e. initially seen by imperial conservatives
    as a bulwark against anti-imperial nationalism; and later on, in the post-1945
    context, as anti-left, socialist Nehruvian etc.), and that Jinnah was conscious
    of and very solicitous of this distinction between him and the Congress left.
    \ Thus to expect the ruling elite of the country to be anything other than what
    it turned out to be -- irredeemably pro-status quo (in this context pro-landlord),
    pro-Western/anti-left -- would have been unrealistic.  No doubt Khan's book (\"Facts
    are Facts\") is polemical and marred by a conspiratorial tone, but he does have
    a point.]"

    "out of nowhere"; i.e., given the wealth of scholarship showing how, beginning
    in the nineteenth century, "Indianness" came to be constructed in terms of "Hinduness",
    the latter being defined as the very essence of the new nation state, this was
    not an especially inclusive basis on which to "found" the nation as far as Muslim
    Indians were concerned.  But equally, that history does not mean that the demand
    for Pakistan was inevitable, or the only viable "counter-mobilization", even if
    it was, ultimately, the most successful one.

    with reference to James Mill I don't think that the understanding of social dynamics

    In fact, I find the proposition positively bizarre. There is absolutely no doubt

    explanatory capacity. What I wrote was quite clear, \"The linguistic and ethnic

    challenge: \"lets cross over that Durand Line and tell me why &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Talibanization&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    will flourish amongst Sindhis, Punjabis or Baluchis?\" As I pointed out, Talibanization
    already flourishes in the (predominantly Punjabi) Pakistani military. Certainly,
    I didn't intend to start a whole debate on the Partition. It's hardly my fault
    if others want to seize upon one thing in my post and run off in another direction
    with it."

    \"\r\n\r\nSpencer where exactly did I make these comments?\r\n\r\n\"As for your
    gratuitous comments about my attitudes towards &acirc;&euro;&oelig;brown people,&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    I think you would do well to treat your interlocutors with greater respect.\"\r\n\r\nI
    treat my interlocuators with great respect and care. However I am sorry I cannot
    show any reverence to those who are not deserving of my respect, does not matter
    who they are. I am debating their thoughts and Ideology and not their personal
    life.\r\n\r\n\"Your comments about Albright, Pipes, and Campus Watch are likewise
    gratuitous and undeserving of reply.'\r\nWell fair if my respected interloculator
    thinks so.\r\n\r\n\"The term Islamist fascists refers to a fascist brand of politics
    that speaks in the name of Islam. It says nothing whatsoever about Islam as a
    religion or Muslim people per se any more than do the terms Hindu fascism or Christian
    fascism. The term&acirc;&euro;&trade;s meaning is plain.\"\r\nThis term was coined
    and has been used by  thinktanks, politicians, commentatotrs, who have a certain
    word view. Since you used it too, so It is hard for me to discern, you mean something
    different by it.\r\nBut as a metter of common sense when you are dealing with
    a country where >97% population professes to accept some sort of Isalm as their
    faith, using such terms is not going to get us anywhere. Besides that people who
    are still using this term might just be left holding the bag, as Bush ERA  terms
    are vanishing fast even though the policies continue.\r\nNow when you cannot tell
    difference between Kabir and Akbar,( whtas the difference they all look same),
    I guess I rest my case."

  content: "Spencer, I think whatever people's  academic qualifications, living and
    growing up in a particular culture gives you certain insights into that society
    that simply studying it from the outside cannot.  Trained social scientists have
    a lot to add to the discussion, but they would also gain from listening to people
    who are actually part of the society at hand.  For example, someone who grew up
    in pre-Zia Pakistan and then also experienced zia-era Islamization would be able
    to tell you a lot more about the realities than someone who simply studied Islamization
    from the outside. \r\n\r\nWith all due respect, as Akbar has pointed out, you
    have a certain \"Western\" framework and ideology that you are trying to apply
    to Pakistan and it's not always successful. \r\n\r\nAnd I think if you asked Pakistanis,
    they wouldn't be pushing for Marxism or whatever,  most of them (like most other
    people) want to get ahead in life.  They would push for justice, equity,etc. but
    they wouldn't express it in those terms. They would probably express it in Islamic
    terms.   Marxism calls for religion to become irrelevent right? That's not going
    to work in Pakistan where Islam is not going to become irrelevent."

    It is a fascist brand of politics that speaks in the name of Islam. \r\n2)It says
    nothing whatsoever about Islam as a religion or Muslim people per se any more
    than do the terms Hindu fascism or Christian fascism.\r\nThen we can move on to
    the conclusion that some very cunning people are bringing their political agenda
    to realization by these means, right? So politics is art of possibilities. As
    we eastablish these are very cunning people, so they must have brains. Then we
    can say, may be they have some motives, demands etc, rational or irrational does
    not matter. That means there can be a dialogue, right? But no,  at some point
    in history we have entered in a bizzaro world where, this \"Islamist Fascism\"
    has attained a unique, supernatural status. Only prescription the doctor says
    is to eradicate all who can be labelled as such, with millions dollars a piece
    missile if needed. There is a problem, we said it is a political startegy adopted
    by some, so is the military strategy the only answer and that too quick, no time
    to waste!Next problem is who decides who is liquidated and who is not?Who is the
    judge, jury, and the excutioner? Are they not the same people who told us Iraq
    had WMDS and Saddam is in bed with UBL. Funny part is that while CIA tortured
    detaines to get an Iraq link, intellectuals are assaulting everybody's intelligence
    to eastablish once again that there is link between all things \"Taliban\". While
    they chide others for harbouring US/India/... conspiracy theories, unwittingly
    \ or wittingly themselves not only believe in such theories from otherside but
    actively chart the course of their actions based on such . Tragedy is that they
    have real firepower to hurt people. So how is this consesus evolevd. From CIA
    torture to Yellowcake, from Judy miller/NYT to Fred Hiat, and chose your favourite
    neocons, they have the leading /cutting edge information tools at their hands,
    and That is what some are complaining about, that enough is enough. First you
    saved us from \"Evil Empire\". And  now you want to save us from your creation.
    (That help you to defeat the Evil Empire).\r\nThis is the question which begs
    an answer?"

<p>In the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake, many banned "religious" organizations, specifically the militant groups, were prominent contributors to the charity and relief work. Jamaat-e Dawa, previously known as Lashkar-e Taiba maintained a full hospital and many shelters under its humanitarian wing, <i>Idara Khidmet-e Khalq</i> (Department for Service to the People). This is now renamed as <i>Falah-e Insaniyat Foundation</i> (Welfare of Humanity Foundation). That camp, pictured above, has a telling banner: "&Ugrave;&hellip;&Oslash;&sup3;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ugrave;&hellip;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Ugrave;&circ;&Uacute;&ordm; &Uacute;&copy;&Oslash;&sect; &Ugrave;&sbquo;&Oslash;&ordf;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ugrave;&Ugrave; &Oslash;&sup1;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&hellip; &Oslash;&uml;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&macr; &Uacute;&copy;&Ugrave;&Scaron;&Oslash;&sect; &Oslash;&not;&Oslash;&sect;&Ucirc;&ldquo;" (Stop the Rampant Killing of Muslims). Along with the prominently displayed flag. That rhetorical "Muslims" cannot be easily dismissed by the Pakistani military, which in its ham-fisted operation has displaced nearly a million civilians in order to kill or capture mere thousands. The math doesn't add up, does it? Whatever the alternatives might be, this all-out military assault was the only thing that would satisfy the bloodlust here, and the schemers there. We, the American tax-payers, need to see that military power in action against the TALIBOTHRA. </p>
<p>Therein lies the rub. The displaced million are already persona non-grata in Lahore or Karachi. They are already at the mercy of international donors. Where is <i>their</i> state? What recourse or recompense do they have against this military assault? The chicken-hawks will exclaim that it is their just rewards for hosting the TALIBOTHRA; or maybe they are the necessary collateral damage. In the mean time, those speaking <i>to</i> them, <i>about</i> them are these militant organizations. It isn't as simplistic as "hearts & minds" - but it is as simple as "state as protector". </p>
<p>UNCHR can help in the short run, but it is the people of Pakistan who will need to embrace the displaced and get them back home, as soon as possible. </p>
