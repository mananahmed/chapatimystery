  content: "Wait -- I've been saying Pah-ki-stan for all these years. Am I wrong?
    With a k that's not all that hard. Should it be Pahk-i-stan? Damn.     Seriously
    (not that I'm not having small anxiety attacks over this), I cannot believe we
    should be expected to think someone is better for using regional pronunciations
    that sound harsh on the ears. And you know, it's harder to say Eye-ran than Iran.
    \ Hell, it's easier to say Pock-i-stan"

<p>What is with conservatives and the word 'pakistan'? First, there was that insane Christopher Hitchens letter juju. And now comes the cry that Pock-i-stahn is so not <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_10/015092.php">the Amrikan pronunciation</a>. </p>
<p>As a native speaker of Urdu, let me help you out: Pay-Armi-stan, Palin-s-TAN, Pick-a-side-an, Powpow-sometan.</p>
<p>In any case, lets learn how to pronounce Obama's name, properly.</p>
