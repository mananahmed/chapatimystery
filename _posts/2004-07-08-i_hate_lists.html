  content: I'm out. My "top" list is unfairly skewed by repeated listenings of cd
    mixes made for ex-gfs. 'sides, I already wrote a <a href="http://www.1984produkts.com/donkeyhottie/archives/000117.php"

    where is amitabh's voice sampled from.

    from the googled description, i fear to acquaint myself with this song.  i don't trust remixes by people who didn't hear the songs in situ the first time around!!

  content: "desesperanto: You would sorely miss out, if you do not acquire this cd.
    Amitabh's dialogues come from Zanjeer, Don and at least a few from Deewar. \nA
    must have for any fan of the Angry Young Man. As for the remix, there are no greater
    DJs (in my view) than DJ Shadow and Dan Nakamura. The compilation came from 45s
    found in SF record stores. Ignore the completely wrong booklet in the CD. It stinks.
    Just enjoy the beats."

<p><img src="/img/list.gif" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Intellectually, emotionally and conversationally, I abhor lists of all kinds. Top ten this or that makes me feel top-notch geeky. Still, I like <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/000189.html">sven</a> more than I hate lists so, per his request, here is my top 25 songs. Except. He requested something like 25 favorite songs of all time but below are the 25 most played songs from my iTunes. They are my favorite insomuch as they have been played most often. That is all. Do I sound like a curmudgeon? Or a snob? Don't answer! List below the fold.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><b>25: </b><i>A Wolf At The Door (It Girl. Rag Doll)</i> by <b>Radiohead</b>. The whole album is amazing. This is one of the best.
<li><b>24: </b><i>The Good, The Bad and the Chutney</i> by <b>DJ Shadow and Dan the Automater</b>. In terms of Bollywood remixes, <i>Bombay The Hard Way</i> is the best. This song has Amitabh Bachan's voice. Cannot be beaten.
<li><b>23: </b><i>Los Angeles, I'm Yours</i> by <b>The Decembrists</b>. I lived in LA. I do not like LA. This song makes me want to go back to LA.
<li><b>22: </b><i>Hurt</i> by <b>Johnny Cash</b>. One of the great covers of all time. Surpasses my criteria that a cover should re-invent the song. This is the saddest example.
<li><b>21: </b><i>Naufrago</i> by <b>Ibrahim Ferrer</b>. <i>Buena Vista Club</i>'s popularity gave the great Ibrahim Ferrer a new audience. He was introduced to me by my late friend Asad. Everytime I listen to this CD, I remember him.
<li><b>20: </b><i>Banks of Ohio</i> by <b>Snakefarm</b>. No clue why this is here. Not a bad song though the British need to stop fixating on Bluegrass from the 20s.
<li><b>19: </b><i>Piano Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 22</i> by <b>Camille Saint-Sa&Atilde;Å½ns</b>. Must be Ms. Sepoy's work, this one.
<li><b>18: </b><i>Deep Red Bells</i> by <b>Neko Case</b>. Neko has a voice like Patsy Cline and the reverb here is awesome.
<li><b>17: </b><i>Put a Lid On It</i> by <b>Squirrel Nut Zippers</b>. Maha loves this.
<li><b>16: </b><i>One More Cup of Coffee</i> by <b>The White Stripes</b>. White Stripes were cool when they covered old blues ditties and no one else knew about them.
<li><b>15: </b><i>Without Me</i> by <b>Eminem</b>. I would have imagined that some other Eminem song would be here but...this one is good too.
<li><b>14: </b><i>Yeh Jafaa-e Gham Ka Chara</i> by <b>Abida Parveen</b>. Abida Parveen's old Faiz kicks ass.
<li><b>13: </b><i>Cherry Blosson Girl</i> by <b>Air</b>. I don't really like this song. I mean, it is ok, at best.
<li><b>12: </b><i>Sing It Again</i> by <b>Beck</b>. Another great album and an amazing song. I will be listening to new Beck on my 80th birthday.
<li><b>11: </b><i>California Stars</i> by <b>Billy Bragg and Wilco</b>.This is one of my "summer" songs. Makes me want to go camping.
<li><b>10: </b><i>I Want You</i> by <b>Bob Dylan</b>. Short yet sweet.
<li><b>09: </b><i>Hell is Chrome</i> by <b>Wilco</b>. From the new CD, which I am still digesting. slowly.
<li><b>08: </b><i>Good To Be On The Road Back Home Again</i> by <b>Cornershop</b>. Cornershop is good, even though I am the ONLY one who thinks so.
<li><b>07: </b><i>You Win Again</i> by <b>Hank Williams</b>. Another Maha choice.
<li><b>06: </b><i>Love Hurts</i> by <b>The Jayhawks</b>. This is another cover and one of the few good ones.
<li><b>05: </b><i>Lilac Wine</i> by <b>Jeff Buckley</b>. I love this CD, his voice. This is one of my top 2 on that CD. Reminds me of writing web code for some reason...?
<li><b>04: </b><i>Heer Waris Shah</i> by <b>Hamid Ali Bela</b>. Amazing record.
<li><b>03: </b><i>Take Your Mama Out</i> by <b>Scissor Sisters</b>. The song for Summer 2004. Ms. Sepoy is sick of it already.
<li><b>02: </b><i>Meda Ishq</i> by <b>Pathanay Khan</b>. Pathanay Khan could have sung my grocery list and I would be entranced. I wish he was with us still.
<p>and</p>
<li><b>01: </b><i>Life In a Glass House</i> by <b>Radiohead</b>. hey. This one actually IS one of my favorite songs
</ul>
