  content: OK -- looking into some of this.  I use Word because I want to be able
    to move between macs and PCs -- I hope to be moving to a macbook in my next purchase,
    but it's unlikely that SLAC will let me have a mac.  So using M$ products that
    our woefully obstructionist IT people support makes sense.  The other stuff, especially
    the notetaking stuff, is really useful -- thanks!  And my dean swears by Google
    Books, too.

  content: "I missed the Netscape announcement. \r\n\r\nPart of the issue with access
    -- and it's true that OS X is better than previous Apple OS -- is that there's
    a lot of adaptive software already written for the PC/MS environment. Even with
    all the stuff Apple's done to make the OS accessible, if the programs themselves
    can't be made accessible then it's worthless. So until there are screenreaders
    of some sort for the Apple environment, nothing really can get done. \r\n\r\nWe're
    investigating: my wife has wide contacts in the adaptive tech community. There
    are some reports of people using Apples successfully, but we need to know more."

  content: "Accolades to Sepoy for writing this, especially since I am having a software
    related breakdown at the moment.\r\n\r\nRe: Open Office vs. Word, I recently found
    out about Open Office from the tech guy at my office, and thank god for Open Office.
    Right now I'm using Word, but I'm going to have to invest in a new laptop soon,
    and I am simply not going to buy MS Office software. Too expensive. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not in academia anymore, but for the field that I am currently in, MS Office is
    a must regardless of whether it's a MAC and PCer user, and esp for Excel and Word
    (v. little Power Point). People haven't taken to using Google Docs(O, I wish everyone
    would start using that so that I could definitively chuck MS Office!) and unless
    Armageddon hits, it looks like everyone is going to continue using MS Office en
    masse.\r\n\r\n\"Last, last recommendation: No laptops in the classroom.\"\r\n\r\nNot
    in Law School. I was the only- and I repeat- the only freak who didn't bring a
    laptop to lectures. Come finals, and I really, really regretted it.\r\n\r\nBut
    I am with you for non law school courses. Hand-taken notes are the way to go.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    is it just me or does it seem like there is a massive MAC cult, almost in a Big
    Brotheresque manner? Those Apples are everywhere, and to be honest, I don't see
    what all the fuss about MAC's is about. I bought a MAC laptop and returned it
    (couldn't afford it, but also I really, really disliked how MAC works. Or maybe
    it is a question of habit)."

  content: "Thanks for bringing us non-tech-savvy people up to date, sepoy. I would
    agree that laptops are a distraction in the classroom, but mainly because there
    are wireless signals everywhere, and some schools actually provide wireless in
    classrooms, with the result that kids spend class time IMing and god knows what
    else while looking all studious. It pisses me off no end. Why can't signals be
    blocked in classrooms? What the hell do you need wireless for in a lecture hall?\r\n\r\nDI,
    I'm surrounded by MAC cultists too, and it's a bit annoying,yes. I don't like
    the MAC user interface, though my friends assure me it's so much less problem-prone
    that it's worth it."

  content: Well, one reason to have wireless in the classroom is so *I* can use it.  I
    really wish our classrooms weren't, but since they're in buildings with faculty
    offices and student work lounges, there's not much one can do about the signal.  It's
    a real problem, and I am still trying to figure out how to deal with it.  I do
    have students who take notes on their computers.  I have other students who look
    up words while I'm talking or even go to wikipedia or elsewhere to get more info.  I
    think these latter things are distracting and clearly keep students from engaging.  Sadly,
    some of the Schools at the uni require students to use their laptops in class,
    and I feel awkward telling them they can't use a piece of equipment they had to
    buy.  Mostly, I remind them they don't have to carry around an extra 5-7 pounds
    of stuff for my class, and that often keeps them from bringing the damned things.

  content: "\"Your Big Brother comment was insanely amusing. Please watch this.\"\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I remember that commercial ;)\r\n\r\nI just hate those glowing apples, and I now
    resent anyone who blathers on and on about the attributes of MAC laptops.\r\n\r\nMAC's
    interface sucks. It seems too cheap, like it's not worth $1,100. I also don't
    like the one click mouse; I don't like how the most you can maximize still comes
    out really, really small.\r\n\r\nBack to laptops in the classroom: they could
    be distracting, but again, in law courses, you're too freaked out about missing
    any word that comes out of the prof's mouth; so you are anything but compelled
    to check your e-mail and IM your friends. \r\n\r\nAlso, law profs call on you
    and demand an answer: \"Miss DI, please tell us why Iran refused to be present
    during the US case against them for the hostage situation.\" Not a ripe environment
    where you can surf the Web.\r\n\r\nSince we're on the subject of laptops, I advise
    everyone to NEVER buy Toshiba. They don't make good quality laptops anymore. My
    Toshiba laptop from 10 years ago is still working perfectly fine; but the Toshiba
    I bought in Sept 2005 has already fallen apart, and Toshiba's AC adapters suck."

    attached to a projector screen or whatever if needed for instructional purposes,
    but I really don't think wireless in the undergraduate classroom adds more than
    it takes away.\r\n\r\nToshiba laptops suck? My sister's (from 2003) is so sturdy
    that it's still going, long after my Dell POC (Piece of Crap) bought at the same
    time has died after having to be serviced on three continents every six months,
    with the world's rudest and worst customer service (they email you instructions

    contradiction or problem in banning laptop usage during the class - they may be
    required to use it on-campus or in their other classes. But, I simply see it as
    a distraction. Also, we are not teaching law. So whatever happens in law classes
    or business classes can happen there. This here be humanities. We roll our own

    at everyone in a really professional tone to \"grace the class with the explanation,\"
    only to know that if you slip up JUST ONCE, you will be punished via searing criticism.
    :)  \r\n\r\n\"This here be humanities. We roll our own way.\"\r\n\r\nOoh, spoken
    roughly. I like.\r\n\r\nSP:\r\n\r\nYes, the recent and current models of Toshiba
    are cheap, cheap, cheap as hell. It's so janky that I can't believe they put a
    price tag of over a grand (which is what I paid). And the adapters die by the
    second year.\r\n\r\nRe: Dell, good info you provided. I've been thinking about
    getting a Dell laptop, but am too scared in light of the negative comments I hear
    from others. Maybe a ThinkPad, though I've heard people complaining that ever
    since Lenovo took over, the quality has begun to spiral downwards...."

    didn't mean to imply that I disagreed.  I think students using laptops are pimples
    on the face of academic thought.  But I'm teaching in a very 'keep the student

    so have to come up with some way of justifying allowing the damned things.  Although

    just say no!\r\n\r\nAfter all, I say the same thing about them having to use Chicago

  content: "These look very fetching indeed, especially the alternative composition
    tools.  I look forward to making use of them.  (Alas, at work we are forced to
    use MS only--why an organization that's created an awesome plone-based global
    intranet/knowledge management system with extensive web 2.0 toolage is simultaneously
    too conservative to let any of its employees use Macs or Google Desktop is beyond
    me.)  \r\n\r\nThe flickr project is delightful.   I am also very keen on assorted
    mapping resources, and what might be done with them: imagine the bastard child
    of Perry-Castaneda and wikimapia!  \r\n\r\nRisking DI's ire, I will say that I
    am very fond of the OSX interface.  But it's a matter of personal taste and habit
    more than anything else.  I have also found apple laptops to be a good investment--my
    old ibook, bought in Sept 2002, has outlasted 2 batteries and a power cord and
    still runs fine (my teenage sister has it now).  In all that time we've never
    lost a single file, which is lucky given my lame-ass approach to backup.  There
    was a serious problem with the video card about three years in, but Apple fixed
    it for free--and overseas to boot.  (The international service is a plus, in contrast
    to the experience of some friends in the UK who had to ship laptops back to the
    US for under-warranty care.  Coverage in the Middle East is still sparse, tho.)
    \ My current macbook has also been good; this one did have a hard drive failure,
    but again, was fixed swiftly at no charge.\r\n\r\nwhich brings me to a question
    for sepoy--panther yet?  I am wavering--not inclined to spend money, but my ladyfriend
    has it and is pleased.\r\n\r\nfinally, wireless in the classroom is just bad news.
    I've certainly had many googlechat conversations in which the other party was
    sitting in a law school lecture hall."

<p><a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/product_details.asp?mscssid=D7AQT4GKRANV9NKERANAU3G60LLQBRH8&sitetype=1&did=4&sid=60343&pid=&keyword=professor&section=all&title=undefined&whichpage=4&sortBy=popular"><img src='http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/academiccomputing.png' alt='academiccomputing.png' width='250'/></a>I haven't really rolled the mental rolodex over into 2008. Something scares me about that number. It portends change, maybe dislocation, perhaps an end to the way things were. I embrace change with the same fatalism as when a human, lacking the natural means to flight, jumps out of a plane strapped to a parachute. There is something comical about our faith in technologies. </p>
<p>Speaking of technology ....</p>
<p>I imagine that a solid percentage of my gentle readers are academics, and teachers [I imagine it because the writer's audience is always a fiction (Walter Ong didn't know about access logs, of course.)]. As academics, we are a fairly conservative bunch when it comes to technology. Often, because the archipelagos of university bureaucracies keeps technology services safely ensconced away. Often, because we really couldn't find the time to go out and test and acquire new skillsets that are merely cursory to our engagements. Certainly, I have <a href="/archives/univercity/the_polyglot_manifesto_i.html">argued</a> for a change in that attitude but things are what they are. So, I felt that instead of simply pontificating, I could introduce some of the tools that I think can make your life better, dear Professors. </p>
<p>There are three types of technological front-ends that are necessary for our work: researching, composing and sharing. </p>
<p><b>researching:</b> The past few years - since 2003 - have changed the very notion of 'archive' - though, our theorists haven't caught up yet. Ignoring for a moment the glaring non-Roman-script shaped hole in the soul of massive scanning projects, it is incontestable that Amazon and Google have changed our lives. <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> perhaps more so, with major libraries signing up every day (not a good idea, but again, that's a separate discussion). Use the Advanced Search options to find full texts of anything published before 1901. You can now download the whole pdf. It is scanned, indexed and searchable. Writing a paper? Need to look up a quote from a secondary source? Don't have it bookmarked? Look for the search string in Google Books.  </p>
<p>There are many other key online archives but one that I make heavy usage of - and SAists seem oblivious of - is <a href="http://parlipapers.chadwyck.com/infoCentre/hcppguide.jsp">the House of Commons Parliamentary Papers</a> which contain an enormous swath of East India Company reports and commissions. Again, all scanned, indexed and searchable. And you can save a pdf. </p>
<p>The other aspect of online research is the ability to actually keep track of materials. Citations, downloads, bookmarks, etc. There is no better tool at the moment than <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. Zotero is a Firefox extension that can query, capture and re-publish citations and materials from the vast swath of accessible web and catalogs. It really is one of the things that you will not be able to live without, once you start using it. You can export bibliographies in the blink of an eye and in multiple formats. You can archive the ever-fleeting web safely on your hard-drive. However, Zotero has one glaring deficiency: It is currently tied to your local browser. Which means, if you work on your office computer and create your citation archive there, you cannot easily move it to your laptop or your home computer or access it through a work-station at a library etc. [Yes, you can export the Zotero library and re-import it at a different machine but, thats not really feasible.] What Zotero needs is some old-fashioned Web2.0 magic ... an online network - the ability to store one's references with one's account and maybe even related tags through a tag cloud. Eh? I like the thought of that. While I hear that a server-based Zotero is in the work, I recommend that you download and make use of it right away. Get it into your workflow. Trust me. </p>
<p>Speaking of bibliographies, another alternative that I have used, now and then, is <a href="http://ottobib.com/">Otto Bib</a>. It is good for quickly assembling formatted bibs.</p>
<p><b>composing:</b> I hear that people still use Microsoft Word to write. On the PC end, the only alternative worth considering is <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a>. On the Mac side, I don't even know why anyone would use M$ products. Virginia Hefferman recently wrote in NYT about abandoning Word for far more <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06wwln-medium-t.html?ex=1358139600&en=a642588d0751046e&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">attractive options</a> like <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>, <a href="http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/">CopyWrite</a>, <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> and <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/ulysses/">Ulysses</a>. While all the listed apps do have some key benefits - full screen toggle is indeed heaven, if you have never experienced it (hello Word Perfect readers!) - none are really geared towards academic writing. I personally use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> (in its wonderful OS X wrap, <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/">TeXshop</a>) but that may not be every one's cup of tea, either. [NB: Scrivener can be used with <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/Using_MultiMarkdown_with_Scrivener">MultiMarkdown</a> for footnotes.].  For academic, wysiwyg, writing alternative to Word, I recommed trying out <a href="http://www.redlers.com/mellel.html">Mellel</a> or <a href="http://www.nisus.com/pro/">Nisus Writer</a> - they both support unicode and left-to-right input and have some really nice features on top of all that. </p>
<p>Yet, everyone is not really writing entire books all the time. What about less formal compositions? For that, I exclusively use <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>. Mac, PC, whatever -  I can save, track changes, share or publish any document and it is all accessible from Multan. Keeps the headache of multiple copies away. Still, a lot of my colleagues send me .doc files (and expect .doc files in turn). <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a> works great for all that.</p>
<p><b>sharing:</b> On the one hand, we share a lot of documents with each other. Email or Google Docs or <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a> can take care of most of the sharing needs. But there is another aspect: our classes. I can take this opportunity to rail against the monopoly of <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/us/index.Bb">Blackboard</a>'s insanely bad software that most faculty and students have to suffer from. There are alternatives, of course. <a href="http://www.chalksite.com/">Chalk Site</a> or <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> are both excellent for classroom usage. If you can run your own web services - which is as easy as owning a Mac - I recommend running your own WP blog. CM friend, Jeremy is co-author of an excellent plug-in <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/scholarpress-courseware/">Courseware</a> for WP which makes it easy to set up a class blog. He has also developed a facebook app for classroom. I am, though, less than enthusiastic about extending our classroom to facebook. They have a rather grim policy on materials uploaded to their servers (they own it) and, for being one of the most popular social networking sites, their social network is absurdly simplistic. Every one is a friend. I don't really think it is advisable for one's student to be one's "friend" and facebook is fast losing credibility (hello, beacon), in any case. </p>
<p>Similarly, new initiatives for sharing photos are incorporating flickr - see, for example, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/">Library of Congress</a>. It is a remarkable effort to expand <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons">the work of public history</a> ((via <a href="http://www.loc.gov/blog/?p=233">LOC blog</a>: "The real magic comes when the power of the Flickr community takes over. We want people to tag, comment and make notes on the images, just like any other Flickr photo, which will benefit not only the community but also the collections themselves. For instance, many photos are missing key caption information such as where the photo was taken and who is pictured. If such information is collected via Flickr members, it can potentially enhance the quality of the bibliographic records for the images")). I have used flickr with tagging for classroom - see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/179279660/">example</a>- but, I would still like to see an open source alternative to flickr.  </p>
<p>In terms of class, one last recommendation is AOL's timeline tool <a href="http://www.circavie.com/">CircaVie</a> or my personal favorite, <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">MIT's Simile</a>. </p>
<p>Last, last recommendation: No laptops in the classroom.</p>
<p>Do chime in.</p>
