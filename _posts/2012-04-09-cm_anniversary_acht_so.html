  content: Some of the best that I have read in the blogosphere is from here. It seems
    that I missed the early posts and  thus the context  of several posts except those
    which stood on their own. Must browse through the archives some day.

  content: "I am constantly amazed at the material produced by all contributors to
    this blog. As an anthropologist-in-training with more than a passing interest
    in South-Asia, I feel lucky to be able to observe and interact with the discourse
    and thinking of the CMers. Thank-you for your passion, dedication and willingness
    to challenge ideas and ideals, and of course your ability to do so with a fair
    whack of humour and eloquence!\r\n\r\nForever grateful that I stumbled across
    Chapati Mystery."

<p>Once again, I missed it. Eight years ago this little experiment - which, in 2011 produced two books (!) and countless millions of dollars (!!) - began. </p>
<p>There is no denying the fact that dhandha has been manda here lately. I have not found too much time to write.Yet, I have had so many amazing contribution from guest as well as the regulars that CM looks vibrant and alive to me. I intend to keep it this way. This year two of our old friends passed away. Ralph Luker shut down Cliopatria - the historian collective blog which I joined in 2004 as well. Ralph is an amazing curator as well as indefatigable member of the online community for many long years and I wish him all the best. The other good bye was from Sepia Mutiny - the place for desis to mingle. It was certainly a marker in media/social history of Desis in America. Both of these collectives were about community and about connections and about a certain relationship between dominant and marginal discourses. Their shuttering down is most certainly a step back and a diminution of public culture on those terms. There is no doubt that FB and Twitter have taken over conversations in ways unimagined in 2004 but that only means we need to incorporate newer ways of explicit community building. </p>
<p>CM will continue. We are actively adding new members to our writing team. I am excited to write. We are ON!</p>
