    Musharraf necessarily) while we dismantle the feudal system and get some serious
    educational systems in place.  But I'm a wishful thinker, and have also spent
    the last month hoping for a tactical meteor strike to wipe out BB, NS and AH in
    one fell swoop.

  content: "I f you can tell me what is common behind the creation of following; 1)
    Pakistan National Alliance (formed in 1977, agitated against rigging in election
    ,hence Zia,s Martial Law) 2) Islami Jamhoori Ittihad    (formed and won elections
    and Nawaz Sharif being elected their PM) 3)All Parties Democratic Movement(created
    july 2007 in London minus PPP).  Then I can tell you what is wrong with
    Pakistan,s politics!  (For a brief overview of these three entities I have
    attached some cliff,s notes type web entries below but please do your own search.Again
    you can tell I am not that web savy)  1)Pakistan National Alliance From
    Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  The Pakistan National Alliance was a nine-party
    alliance in Pakistan, formed in 1977 to overthrow the rule of Prime Minister Zulfikar
    Ali Bhutto, the first elected leader of that country.   [edit] History The
    Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) manifesto was to bring back the 1970 prices.
    Implementation of Islam was its election slogan. They promised to enforce Islamic
    laws \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\", the Shariah. They were a conglomerate of diverse views
    and of contradictory causes, such as Asghar Khan's secularism, Khan Abdul Wali
    Khan's Socialism and Maulana Maududi's hardline Islamism united
    by common dislike of Zulfiqar Bhutto's autocratic policies. The alliance decided
    to contest the elections under one election symbol \"plough\" and a green flag
    with nine stars as its ensign.  Contesting the 1977 elections jointly the
    PNA launched a national campaign against the government after the controversial
    and allegedly rigged results showing the Peoples Party as an overwhelming victory
    in the general elections. The agitation caught the Peoples Party by surprise and
    after several months of street fighting and demonstrations Bhutto opened negotiations
    with the then imprisoned PNA leaders. Most PNA leaders, along with PPP leaders,
    believe that an agreement was reached; whether or not it would have been signed
    by all PNA parties or by Bhutto remains open to speculation.  An agreement
    was eventually reached in june 1977 and Bhutto was to sign it on July 5. However
    despite the enthusiasm of the negotiating team other PNA leaders had reservations
    about the agreement. The absence of a formal agreement between the government
    and the PNA was used as an excuse by the armed forces under Zia-ul Haq to stage
    a coup in order to break the impasse. Those justifying the coup, argue that no
    agreement had been reached between the two sides.  The Alliance split after
    the Army under Zia ul Haq ousted his goverenment, between elements (Muslim League
    and religious groups) that supported the martial law government and those who
    opposed it.  2)Islami Jamhoori Ittihad ,ISI and Pakistani politics  (
    FOLLOWING IS AN EXCERPT FROM Cowasjee,s recent column from Dawn) In 1996 a
    human rights petition was filed by Air Marshal (rtd) Asghar Khan in the Supreme
    Court of Pakistan (HRC 19/96) against the retired chief of army staff General
    Mirza Muhammad Aslam Beg, the former Inter Services Intelligence chief retired
    Lt-General Asad Durrani and Younis Habib of Habib and Mehran Banks, relating to
    the disbursement of public money and its misuse for political purposes.  The
    case was initiated by the Air Marshal after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
    Interior Minister, another retired general, Nasirullah Babar, on June 11, 1996,
    announced on the floor of the National Assembly that the former COAS, General
    Mirza Aslam Beg had, in 1990, during the run-up to the elections held that year,
    withdrawn an amount of Rs.140 million from Mehran Bank, handed it over to the
    ISI chief, Lt-General Asad Durrani and asked him to suitably disburse the amount
    to a selection of anti-PPP politicians and thus rig the elections in favour of
    the ISI-tailored IJI and Nawaz Sharif.  Shortly thereafter Justice Shah
    received a letter from Air Marshal (retd) Asghar Khan, copied to the then COAS
    General Jehangir Karamat, drawing his attention to the matter. On the basis of
    this letter, an attached press clippings and an affidavit signed by Asad Durrani
    listing the politicians to whom money had been paid, the Supreme Court decided
    to register a case under Article 184(3) of the constitution.  The petitioner,
    Asghar Khan, requested that Beg, Durrani and Younas Habib of Habib and Mehran
    Banks be named as respondents. The ISI requested that the hearing be in-camera
    and the Court agreed to the request insofar as proceedings regarding the legal
    position of the ISI were concerned.  Hearings commenced in February 1997
    and continued through the year. On November 6, the statements of Babar and Durrani
    were to be recorded. The Court, under Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, was faced
    with the awkward question as to the law under which the ISI and its political
    cell had been set up. Beg's counsel, Akram Shaikh, after fulsome
    praise of the agency and its great achievements — greater than
    those of RAW, the KGB or MI-5 — explained how the political
    cell had been established in 1975 under the orders of the then prime minister,
    Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Court asked the Attorney-General (Nawaz's
    lawyer Chaudhry Mohammed Farooq) to provide the relevant documentation as to the
    scope of the activities of the political cell and to clarify whether, under the
    law, part of its duties was to distribute funds for the purpose of rigging elections.  The
    AG, of course, wriggled out of that one by stating that the matter was of such
    a 'sensitive' and 'delicate'
    nature that it could not be heard in open court. Asghar's lawyer,
    Habib Wahab ul Khairi, countered by saying that as the entire matter had been
    aired in the press, with all the names involved fully listed, there was little
    left to warrant in-camera proceedings, and besides, the people had every right
    to know how their money had been used and whether the use in question was permitted
    by law.  The court, however, allowed the recording of Babar's
    and Durrani's statements and their cross examination to be
    held in camera , which they were on November 19 and 20.  Seven days later,
    on November 27, 1997, the Supreme Court was stormed by Nawaz's
    goons and shortly thereafter Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was sent home. We heard
    no more about this petition, filed, for once, truly in the national interest,
    until The Herald, the monthly magazine of this newspaper's
    group, in its issue of April 2000 published a report by Mubasshir Zaidi ('Forging
    democracy') which made mention of it : &ldquo;The
    case has since been heard and on October 11, 1999, just a day before the military
    overthrew the 'heavily mandated' Sharif
    government, the sitting Chief Justice, Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, announced that he
    had reserved judgment on the ISI case.&rdquo;  Almost three years
    later, after a deafening silence from the Court, on August 10, 2002, Asghar Khan
    addressed a letter to the then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sheikh Riaz Ahmed, its
    subject &ldquo;HRC No.19/96, Air Marshal (R) Mohammad Asghar Khan
    versus General (R) Mirza Aslam Beg.&rdquo; It read : &ldquo;I
    should like to draw you attention to my letter MAK/12/5 addressed to your predecessor
    on 8 April, 2000, requesting that the above case may please be reopened. I have
    received no reply to this letter and elections are due on 10 October, 2002.  Many
    of the people who are guilty of misconduct will, if the case is not heard, be
    taking part in the elections and the purpose of those elections will thus be defeated.
    I would request an early hearing and decision in this case.&rdquo;  Again,
    nothing happened. The case has remained morgued amidst thousands of pending cases
    lying with the Supreme Court of Pakistan.  Now, in this election year of
    2007, and before this round of 'free and fair'
    elections takes place, before the ISI and its sister agencies once more get into
    the act, and before the main actors depart from this world, will the reinstated
    Chief Justice of Pakistan, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, take up the Retired Air
    Marshal's petition and see it to its finality. It is of vital
    importance to the future political scenario as it should incriminate and disqualify
    many an aspiring public representative hoping to lord it over this nation yet
    again.  And will the stalwarts of the Supreme Court Bar Association please
    help the retired Air Marshal — he needs legal representation.       3)APDM

    \   News, Pakistan, International, UK      LONDON: All Parties Democratic
    Movement has been formed during the All Parties Conference (APC) in London today.
    However, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has decided to boycott
    this decision.  According to details, the All Parties Democratic Movement
    has been formed and Nawaz Sharif said in this context that this movement is necessary
    for stopping Pervez Musharraf from becoming the president again, restoring complete
    democracy in the country and saving Pakistan.   Nawaz Sharif did not explain
    that the ways of the PPP and the Muslim League Nawaz Group have now been separated.  The
    PPP had boycotted the APC, being held in London, and the chief of its group had
    come out of the APC session.    NB  For introduction to All Parties Democratic
    movement , see informed comment by Professor cole on his weblog dated july 16,2007,

  content: "United States Joins Generals and Crooks In Pakistan  by Haroon Siddiqui  One
    former prime minister in exile has been given permission to return home. Another,
    also in exile, is doing a deal with the military ruler to return. Both politicians
    hope to contest the election scheduled for spring but which could come this fall.The
    ruler himself, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is on the ropes, abandoned by both the right
    and the left.  Surely, democracy is returning to Pakistan. Not quite.  Musharraf
    is not done yet, backed as he is by the U.S. And former prime ministers Nawaz
    Sharif and Benazir Bhutto are not the best of torchbearers for civilian rule.  Bhutto
    was elected twice and dismissed twice ('88-'90
    and '93-'96) by civilian presidents for
    corruption.  Sharif's own two terms ('90-'93
    and '97-'99) were marred by crony capitalism
    and authoritarianism. He was jailed on several charges, including tax evasion.
    In 2000, he signed a deal to exile himself to Saudi Arabia (once the home of Idi
    Amin of Uganda). On Thursday, the Pakistani supreme court ruled that that deal
    was not legally binding.  If Sharif does return, he may be led back to jail,
    a prospect he doesn't seem to mind; it could help transform
    him from convict to martyr.  Bhutto won't return until
    Musharraf drops the corruption charges still pending against her, a matter the
    two discussed at a not-so-secret meeting in Dubai July 27.  She and Sharif
    also want the rules changed to let a prime minister serve a third term.  Musharraf,
    too, has his wish list.  He was elected in 2002 by the National Assembly
    and the four provincial legislatures. His term ends in October, and theirs soon
    after. He wants them to re-elect him.  Not kosher, say his critics; he should
    wait and seek a mandate from freshly elected assemblies after the election.  But
    if he insists on a vote now, he'll be challenged in the supreme
    court. His nemesis, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, may nullify the vote.  To
    pre-empt that possibility, Musharraf summoned the judge to his house March 9.
    Four other senior generals were there. They said he should quit, for misuse of
    power - such as insisting on being driven around in a high-end Mercedes.  He
    refused to be intimidated, launched a media-savvy campaign addressing protest
    rallies, and appealed to his own court. It reinstated him July 20.  (The
    controversy at least proved that the judiciary is independent and the media, enjoying
    record profits under a strong economy, are free. In the current euphoria, people
    haven't got around to asking whether the court has crossed
    the line into politics and why Chaudhry isn't recusing himself
    in cases where he arguably has a conflict).  Meanwhile, the Islamists have
    been nipping at Musharraf's heels for being an American ally
    in the war on terrorism.  Ironically, the Bush administration is not happy
    with him either. Not for his violations of human rights, such as the disappearance
    of nearly 300 people, but for not killing Al Qaeda and Taliban faster than America
    is making them.  Besieged, Musharraf turned to Bhutto - with Washington
    playing matchmaker. It wants him but with a democratic gloss. In return for her
    becoming prime minister, her People's Party can help him stay
    on.  There's only the issue of his uniform to be sorted
    out. A legal compromise allowing him to hold the posts of both president and chief
    of staff runs out Dec. 31. Justice Chaudhry may have a view on that, too. So,
    Bhutto and Musharraf are working on how to get around that.  The exercise
    may yet backfire.  Sharif could conceivably win. That might prompt the general
    to declare martial law. Or, his deal with Bhutto might demoralize pro-democracy
    forces, making the Islamists even stronger.  Rather than the dawn of democracy,
    we are witnessing cynical ploys by several self-serving parties, with Washington
    right in the thick of it.  Haroon Siddiqui, the Star's
    editorial page editor emeritus, appears Thursday in World and Sunday in the A-section.

    but something is missing in this picture.( I start here because Pakistan being
    client state is being pulled in different directions rather forcefully.)  As
    H.L Menchen,s prophecy comes true  \"When a candidate for public office
    faces the voters he does not face men of sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief
    distinguishing mark is the fact that they are quite incapable of weighing ideas,
    or even of comprehending any save the most elemental &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; men
    whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and whose dominant emotion is
    dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted, the candidate must either
    bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically,
    the most devious and mediocre &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the man who can most adeptly
    disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year
    by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents,
    more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal.
    On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's
    desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.\""

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/08/r1464332140.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Nawaz Sharif' />The Supreme Court has ruled that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/world/asia/23cnd-pakistan.html?ex=1345521600&en=d2974ebb7f0ee05c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Nawaz Sharif can return to Pakistan</a>. </p>
<p>Nawaz Sharif, you may recall, was the Prime Minister who tried to kill The General by refusing to allow The General's plane to land in Karachi and immediately succumbed to the coup soon thereafter. He then fled to Saudi Arabia clutching a suitcase filled with gold and agreed not to return for 10 years. That's what The General said, at least. Nawaz Sharif, on the other hand, maintains that he was ousted, forced to sign an agreement at gun-point to stay in exile, and should not be denied his rights to return. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court agrees with Nawaz Sharif. Exile is bad. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Bhutto has given <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/08/23/top3.htm">details</a> of power-sharing discussions which include two elections, one with The General as The General and one with Pervez Musharraf as The Artist Formerly Known as The General.</p>
<p>Both exiled ex-PMs Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif will be back in Pakistan by October and running for re-re-re-election in December. And that, gentle readers, couldn't be better news - the election, ie, not Bhutto or Sharif in power again! But as I have said many times, let the people choose. </p>
<p>What does it all mean? In terms of internal politics of Pakistan, this is tremendous news for the resurgent democratic movement in Pakistan. The full participation of the many political parties - including the Bhuttos and Sharifs - will guarantee that Pakistan start recovering from the despotic military regime. However, that is easier said than done. The military, under Musharraf, has become the largest land-owning, asset-controlling entity in Pakistan with ex- and current military officials serving across the civil and social landscape. How can that military be coaxed "back into the barracks"? It is quite probable that there are forces within the military eager to curtail their political vulnerabilities. The popular image of the military in Pakistani society has underwent tremendous change in recent years - from a highly valued and respected institution (the only "corruption-free" one) to a hegemonic and undesirable presence. I could argue that the military's own interests lie in withdrawing from the political realm and re-burnishing its image and standing. Of course, the defense budget remains the highest expenditure in the country and no successive civil government will change that. By and large, the military cannot lose by "giving democracy back" to the country. That was, after all, what Musharraf claimed when he took control. </p>
<p>In terms of oft-mentioned "Talibanization" of Pakistan and the wider conflict with extremism, the answers are less apparent at the moment. Some certainties do exist: any civil government will continue to fully cooperate with the US efforts. In fact, the efforts in Waziristan would be strengthened by the participation of Baluchistani leaders at the Federal level [Baluchistan has always been a Federal/State controversy]. The elections will not result in any rise-to-power of Mullah Omar in Islamabad. And a democratic Pakistan will surely be a far valuable ally within the Muslim world. The uncertainties largely hinge on the nature of the elections - the participation of various groups and their freedoms to do so. It will also be a chaotic period which can make Pakistan vulnerable to further attacks and incursions. </p>
<p>However, the bottom line is that Pakistan needs full and immediate US support through the next six months. UN should take an interest in insuring fair elections. And the subsequent government should be cultivated and nourished throughout the full term.</p>
