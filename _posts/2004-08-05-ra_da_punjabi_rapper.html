    This is just a note to add to your writeup of Bohemia the Punjabi rapper. I agree that it's about time we had a rapper (a GOOD rapper) to represent us. I live in Oakland, Ca. West Oakland to be exact, and it is crazy and violent out here. Someone gets killed every day. Even desi kids out here get into it-the street lifestyle. Most desis dont aknowledge the fact that there are many american ghettos full of us! we don't all go straight to med school ya know! I guess I feel what bohemia raps about cause it is what many young Desi people around me live.
    peace

    ok i'm avoiding my work by browsing chapati and don't even know if this 2 month late response will post but i say....

    what-EV-uh, son.  i am at a computer with no speakers but at a glance i can tell from "bohemia"'s  (what the fuck is that name about?? what does a kid cashing in on stale trends and reinforcing annoying stereotypes  have to do with either a region in the czech republic or artists living frugally in cold water flats???? get your damn references straight before hitting the streets, boyeeee) website that it's more of the same bullshit.  sepoy might like it for witty conceptual reasons and reggie might feel a twinge of exciting empowerment at finally belonging to the now mainstream buffoonery that passes for masculinity in the "'hood" and in the shopping malls...but i just got home from teaching an after-school program in brooklyn and if i see one more 11 year old grab the crotch of his stupid big pants while he shoots me his 'you can't touch this' look or 10 year old talk about the 'hos' he's gonna hook up with tonight I'M GONNA FRIGGIN' PUKE ALL OVER the dangerous STUPID travesty that is everything "gansta"!!!!!!  it's a self-perpetuating fantasy and reggie you like it cause it makes you proud to see desis looking badass.  that's ok but don't mistake it for reality please.  reality is having the balls to be the best you can despite any circumstances, not luxuriating in indulgent bad-boy bullshit and calling it "representation".   out.

  content: "yo deej \nok, fairnuff, i can't speak in a fully informed way about bohemia
    if i haven't heard the lyrics. my bad. \nbut, here's a little about the world
    i'm livin in:\n1) as mc naveed, the real deal from lahore, says: somethin's definitely
    wrong if you feel the need to dis yo own grandma \n2) the only hate i have is
    for the giant media corporations who make millions off low-income folks by controlling
    \"what's hot\" in such an insidious way that the same folks actually think they're
    being \"represented\".\n3) most of the boyz - black, hispanic, desi, white - who
    walk around mouthing all the words to their favorite tunes and identify so strongly
    with songs about \"the streets\"  actually HAVE NO IDEA about \"the streets\"
    \ - they ain't livin' in crackhouses, they have mamas and ammas at home flippin'
    tortillas and parathas... but the fantasy of bein' badass is so appealing that
    they flirt with life on \"the streets\" and end up shot or in jail, not for a
    cause, but for a damn 'guns and hos' fantasy, a fantasy of wanting to belong and
    be a big man. i've seen it first hand more times than i care to count.\n4) speaking
    of causes: the worst thing about the commodification of hip hop and rap is that
    it hypnotizes the people - the oppressed and minorities - and they become zombies
    and buy all the shit they told to buy instead of makin a damn revolution, which
    is what SHOULD be happening in this divided country.\n5) i actually am just about
    old enough to be yo grandma, which means i remember the early eighties, when rap
    came on the scene as a powerful, original verbal art form, when independent-minded
    young people used words skillfully and creatively and politically to outsmart
    the system, not to line its pockets.  if bohemia can do that, then he got mad
    props from me. peace."

  content: 'This  is in response to Dani. First off, you seem like you are in denial
    of the fact that there are Desis who grow up in the hood. It''s not just a bunch
    of people wearing baggy pants and grabbing their crotches. We (people in the ghettos)
    live in an environment that is so much realer and far  less pretentious than your
    little  suburban neighborhoods with picket fences and people watering the lawns.
    And you say you old enough to be a grandma?-no wonder you can''t relate! Listen
    here Grandma: I live in the ghetto. Yes, the crack houses. Yes the killers. I
    live in East Oakland, California. My older brother was murdered, my older sister
    was murdered. My best friend aint even 18 and he''s  in Vacaville  state pen with
    an L for a 187. Up here in Oakland we have hellicopters circling our blocks around
    the  clock to spy on the dope spots. We shoot  at the fuckin hellicopters when
    we bored.  NOW I am not bragging, but  maybe THATS why Bohemia raps about the
    shit he raps about. That is life for us here. Dont matter, Brooklyn or Oakland,
    old people like you can''t relate if you ain''t in our shoes to begin with. So  go
    back to Abercrombie and Fisch after you get out of your little after school "mentoring",
    and check your self. Then tell me these kids really look up to your old ass -By
    the way, can you be my mentor?  Yeah cuz I''m only 17...Trick.'

    CH, im not hating on bohemia, i think hes got skills,
    but admit, what bohemia raps about is something only a minority of desis can relate to.
    even rappers, when being honest, admit to embellishing...didnt jadakiss say something like "why do rappers lie in half of they rhymes"

    so in a way parts of 'gangsta rap'
    is fantasy and the line becomes blurred.
    what dani might be talking about is middle class kids imitating the ghetto life. ive done some research and it seems alot of desi gangs in the bay area are middle class, they dont live in crack infested, mainly black neighborhoods that the 'gangsta' lifestyle came from. its become a machismo/respect thing for some middle class desis/asians/latins/blacks.
    also, the way you phrase your post honestly sounds exaggerated, for starters, most real ghetto people have a contempt for suburban or middle class posers, but what she said seemed to go right over your head. shes talking about middle class wannabe gangstas whose parents have good jobs etc. i know it gets real with hustlin and even murders, but it really is a fantasy these middle class kids are chasing. they are imitating a lifestyle that originated in black ghettos, when they are not even from the ghetto and have better options than hustlin.

  content: "i also want to add that middle class whites also get into the gangsta
    lifestyle, but it less common.\ni totally understand why these middle class desis,asians
    etc, get caught up in this lifestyle.\nthey dont fit into the 'white' ideal, the
    abercrombie life. and then some of these abercrombie whites are the most racist
    arrogant people. im all for desis standing up for themselves. im all for some
    arrogant racist white guy getting put in check for making a racist comment to
    a desi.\nits enpowering to be a desi thug, to have these assholes who look down
    on us, to fear us. its good in a way, for us to unite and look out for each other.
    but why cant desis look out for each other, be proud,tough,cool, stylish etc.
    but cut back on the whole 'gangsta'crap, which ultimately backfires. be intelligent,finish
    college,etc. \nfor example, in vancouver the desi thugs are peddling for chinese
    triads and white hells angels. we are not established, nor have the numbers to
    rival these long established gangs. so much like a black ultimately is selling
    for colombians, cubans etc. these desi g's are much the same. they kill each other
    fighting for supremacy, respect etc. i believe this is by design, the H.A.'s and
    triads are able to get the most out of the situation by making the desis compete
    with each other. \"divide and conquer\" and these kids end up killing each other
    because they are lost, unable to reconcile our punjabi upbringing with an increasingly
    ethicless materialistic society..."

    I think Raj is watching too many movies. "devide and conquer"? Ha ha! Ay yo my man I'm from Canada, and it ain't that bad...Hells Angels started in Oakland...the ones in Canada are wannabes, and Chinese triads? they stick to their own race with their criminal activity(the real ones at least). I don't know if you ever been to the ghettos in San Francisco or Oakland, but the killing zones are fuckin REAL. not wannabe. Not some kid tryin to be hard. REAL. Kids selling crack to their own mothers. twelve year olds with mack 10s. Black,East Asian,Mexican and yes, Desi.-As for the whole "middle class" Desi thug thing, I agree. BUT hey, aren't we getting a little far from the original subject at hand? ---If you listen to Bohemia's music you realize that he is not promoting the "thug image". His album (Not just the mp3's off his website) is full of great lyrical content. Dude has got to be one of the best rappers out there main stream or not, Desi,Black,White whatever. Hey, I'm proud that we finally have a good rapper for once!

    Peace

  content: "well, im not from Canada, although i have family/friends in Vancouver
    and Toronto. all im sayin is something like 20 desis have been killed in the vancouver
    drug trade in just the last couple years. thats alot for vancouver, canada. and
    they were making real paper, driving new Bimmers,loft apts etc. but ill admit
    canada is nothing compared to the states crime-wise. ive visited the bay area,
    but i dont know the area. i do know that by far the majority of ghetto dwellers
    are black and hispanic. im sure there are some some asian,desi and white but they
    got to be the minority. maybe its different in the bay area, but where ive lived,
    theres not alot of love between the different races. ive heard about black and
    mexicans having beef in cali. most ghetto kalas are racist towards desis. when
    CH said his two siblings were killed my original thought is yeah they got murdered
    in a robbery at their store. i dont doubt that some desis are real ghetto thugs,
    but its rare. \nas for divide and conquer, ok im going too far, but this is the
    tactic the white man has used succesfully against all minorities. the sikhs could
    have possibly defeated the british if our leadership had not sold out.\nbut yeah,
    i agree that bohemia has talent, and its cool that hes reppin for us and especially
    the desis in the ghettos. i just hate to see some desi going to prison because
    he was tryin to front like some kala thug with an 85 IQ...also, what do desis
    do when they go to prison? i know each pen is different,out here in the detroit
    area, there are some arabs/middle easterners they can hang with. ive heard in
    cali, prisons are even more gang/race divided. where would a desi fit in? it sounds
    like it would be a tough situation.."

    I am a youth counselor hear in N. California.  I am half Pakistani /Latino.  I came across this chat-board accidentaly and found it quite interesting. The focus of most of these postings (along with Bohemia) seems to be Desi youth identifying heavily with the street element. I think that young people, no matter what race, get a certain thrill from having a connection to the streets, weather directly or indirectly. Raj is right in that many Desi youth come from suburban backgrounds, but are attracted to the street life. Ashu is also right, in that there are many Desis from the ghettos. But I think that the Bay Area is a very unique case, in that it is a major American metropolis, but it is more racially diverse than most.  In the ghettos in Oakland, Richmond or SF for instance, you see Desi kids hanging with Black kids, Asian kids hanging with Chicano kids, etc. The bottom line is, all of these young kids black, yellow and brown are caught up in the same environment. It's sad because they have been so exposed to killing that they seem to consider it a common part of daily life. Some rap music, along with movies and TV contribute to this. In reading up on Bohemia I found that he is actually very conscious of what he puts out and how it will affect listeners.  He definitely has that rough street element in his music, but he doesn&Atilde;&shy;t do it in a way that manipulates young kids into wanting to be &Atilde;&not;hard&Atilde;&reg;.  I only wish rappers like 50 cent would take more responsibility in their influence on children of color.  Not to sound cheesy, but all of us people of color have a common bond &Atilde;&plusmn; we are all looked upon, and categorized as &Atilde;&laquo;colored&Atilde;&shy;.  Politicians group us together as a sort of &Atilde;&not;culture&Atilde;&reg; simply based on the fact that we are all different than White-Americans. Just  check this link out (sorry for the essay y&Atilde;&shy;all)

    is the lamest, easiest shit i can imagine.  if there's one thing that \"represents\"
    desi life it's respect for elders... and i am sure such a strong culture can somehow
    find a way to withstand life in the ghetto\n\nand for the record y'all i wasn't
    only talking about suburban kids (although that's definitely an issue), i'm talking
    about  yes real life ghetto situations where kids who could possibly change their
    lives, don't, and how the thug appeal is a factor in that.  i was trying to say
    that for those on the borderline (those with working parents or siblings, with
    some semblance of a home life, even if it's unstable) it's often the gangsta image
    that wins out over any other course of action.  yes dealing and banging is the
    predominant environment, and one is pressured in many ways (financial need, peer
    approval, gang allegiances)  to participate in it, and it is definitely the most
    exciting,  quick money option...but still not the ONLY option....you gotta be
    mad brave to work for minimum wage or focus on school when your family needs money
    and so many people around you are making fast cash and they want you to join them
    and call you a damn fool or maybe even try to shoot you when you don't.   but
    i've seen a handful of people fight against great disadvantage to do it,  it can
    be done.\n\nok, back to the topic.   go bo.  win that shit.\n\npeace and good
    luck to all y'all jigars"

  content: First off Bohemias allright, and I wanna give him some time to see how
    he does, but more power to him for what hes doing, About thw whole "thugged" out
    desi shit, I think that the well of desis, and suburban desis are the ones who
    mostly try that image on, coming from out of the city into it trying to gang bang
    or whatever, but I think alot of desis living in the city try having better for
    themselves, My father was an alcholic, while I was growing up stoppped when I
    was 14, and now very religious, but it had an impact on my older brother whos
    now hooked on something, doesnt really come home, my younger brother is an alcholic,
    hes 19, and I was heavily into drugs up until a year ago, I was arrested with
    2 oz of dro, and thats what my wake up call was, we dont live in the best neighborhood,
    its in Chicagos Rogers Park hood, really mixed, we have gangs, murders, dealers,
    and hookers, hell down t he block one guy got killed anyone from Chi would know
    Shox and AK, and the girl down the street is a crack head prostitute, and neighbors
    are gangsters to, (probably my little brother not sure)were doing OK financially
    we pay the bills, dad drives cab mom works at bank, we all got our ghetto fabulous
    rides (ex-cabs tru desis :-) but I try going to school and work my ass off 60hrs
    week, and hope for the best for me and my family become rich and move out to a
    better area, ppl need to realize we have our desi thugs, and our desi fakes, it
    depends on what you want, hell next time you read this I may be drinkin on  the
    corner again, shit devons not the best area, Bloods, Kings, but make somethin
    of yourself, peace

  content: "yo Singh I agree with you, but I think it's funny how all this shit is
    getting blown so way outa fuckin proportion. I am a Bohemia fan and he ain't really
    trying to say he's a thug! He's simply talking about his experiences -HIS personal
    experiences as a desi. It's funny how just because he mentions weed or drink and
    the occasional gun he's labeled a \"gangster rapper\".  I had the pleadure of
    actualy meeting this dude at a show he did in Texas, and he was a down ass brotha.
    -meaning he was down to earth and not acting all hard and shit like alot of y'all
    are accusing him of. Anyway, I'm proud of the brotha. \nPeace TruToDaEast"

    hey of this pakman topic for a sec.  what the hell is the deal with Bohemia not being nominated by www.desiclub.com for best musical artist? they put of Kidd Skilly but not bohemia? Kidd skilly isnt trying to hold it down for desis:
    "to other South Asian rappers, I hope you can put your music before your ethnicity, real music ain't about gimmicks"

    i respsect that hes trying to make it, and he puts out good music, but hes not representing desis like Bohemia definitley is.  i was just shocked to see that he hadnt been nominated for that awards thing

    I Havn't been on this site for a min..but DAMM People are fighting ova bohemia's, n PAK's music that they should get awarded??? funny yarr..

    I think kidd silly is a talented singer/HipHop artist..
    Even thoe he got nominated, he put work like us, and all it is the fan base...we all are building fans and friends, but we should more payin attention in supporting as voting in stuff like nominees n sh*t, but its cool ,
    to me i thank y'all who love my music and support me as an artist, that gives me more fuel to make and make more music, if it wasnt for u people i wouldn't even be here writting....

    But i thank you, and if i deserv a chance to be in the nominees one day, its only because of u guys, i dont care politics of this game, as long as ur music is tight, and u guys support ....I would get my chance , my GOD is with me..
    and BOHEMIA!! he got a fan base too, he's doing his music, tight, props to that foo , what so ever how he play the role in this music industry...
    He'll get what he deserves as long as u guys do ur part , and that is support..

    We all are one desi , what so ever...so we should be more happy instead fighting ova who should'v won the nominnee...
    Every body get there chances in life....

    to be Bohemia...But to be honest im not into talkin sh*t...\nCuz i consider that
    u are nothing but a f*kin hater..are u afraid of change???\nIv been rappin way
    before Bohemia even exist...I dont know if u been to dess, but you should find
    out that PAKMAN , has a name and reputation in Dess...u guys are so excited of
    lisning abut drgs, n bitches...dont get me wrong i luv'em all, but insted of hatin
    on somebodies music, u should come hang out here with me and see the real life
    of PAKMAN, then tell me to my face that im tryin to be Raju....\nI am nothin like
    that foo...He got his own style .\nlisten to my song (unless u dont know ur own
    language) and u just listen.\nProbly when im flowing u understand few words and
    then assume that im tryin to be raju...Naww homie...\nLET ME GET THIS SH*T STRAIGHT...ANSWER
    MY QUESTION..\n\nif someone is rappin in a language what u could speak, does that
    mean someone's copiying Raju's shit...or tryin to be like him???\n\nif thats true,
    then all the rapper in the states(US) or OVERSEAS..rappin singin in english ..so
    that means they are copyin tupac, biggie, Wutang, Marvin gay, Jada....they all
    fake ..right??!!\n\nNO!! they have all speak english and they have their own style
    and lyrics, which they speak the truth about life...\n\nand now if someone is
    reppin ur dess or reppin ur dess by language, they are tryin to be somebody..right
    JITEN!!?? \n\nIts a shame that these people ova here are nothin but haters, that
    not just hate their own people, they hate the way they sing, or rap..\nRemember
    brother, Listen to the music(mine) then listen to the lyrics, then listen to Raju(Bohemia)
    then listen to his lyrics, then tell me what is that u think im tryin to be him...\n\nI
    dosnt mean if u heard someone 1st flow or sing or rap , then the other is automatically
    fake...\n\nI havent heard Bohemia made any comment about me tryin to be him...\n\nwhat
    does he gotta say about this..iv been in the rap game in the states for about
    5 years now... Before that in dess iv been in music for about scince i was 15
    man....\n\nWHY PEOPLE ARE SO IGNANT??? \n\nI'v been performing on the road too,
    last month i was at the Lowrider car show with the yingyang twins, Joonbug, Grimm,
    i hope u were ther..cuz then u definatly woudv seen me... you shoud'v been ther
    i would brought u bakstage and we could have fun together , many girls and much

    Okay, I didn't bother to go through all the garbage that's been posted here from a bunch of lowdown contaminated scuzzballs, if you do happen to have something called 'perception skills' then most of you will start thinking straight after this. I would imagine that maybe most of the people participating in this 'great' discussion about the 'GREAT' Punani Rapper are teenagers, punjabis and how can I forget the pakis.  So I'll take it for granted that you guys lack basic intelligence much less the ability to even express your thoughts because of language difficulties. But lets not get into that, basically  the reason I'm posting this message is to try and knock some sense into your heads (if you have one). This supposedly great rapper of yours is appenrently the best thng that's happened to the Desi community, right? I mean that's what all of you are trying so hard to say eh? Guy talks about the lowest forms of human material and now he's being talked about in an almost honarary manner. It really is sick if you come to think about it that this is the disposition of desi youth  all over the world whereas Desis (Indians) have so much positive things to be proud of. Why is it that most south asian kids and adults are more drawn towards a kind of music that's so despicable that it doesn't even need any criticism; pretty much every rapper depicts how much art and skill is involved in this genre. You cannot define skills on your own terms it has to expand on creativity. I can fart on a microphone for 2 hrs and say dierehha is the driving force behind my 'talent'. Do you understand what I'm saying or is this more like an overhead transmission situation? Just out of curiosity, if you guys really understand what skill is, have you heard of Pink Floyd? Please do yourself a favour and listen to them and educate yourselves on what defines 'Talent'. What's next some punjabi dimwit coming out as a pimp and he's the next big thing after this cockroch?

    Howcome desis don't comeout with a truely inspiring music that can actually be appreciated? I bet every desi kid knows very little about the Black Culture and it's significance in how music has evolved, be it RAP or ROCK and yet they work the asses off to talk black, walk black, act black and whats worse taking pride in the fact that your such a sham. So you really want to be black and tough, how many of you have heard of Jimi Hendrix or even Billie Holliday? Let me take a stab at it,  ummmm NONE.  Cos you know shit about youself or the neighbouring community. Artistic Creativity may never be introduced to Pakis and Sikhs but this has inturn caused a whole lot of damage to a big ethnic group.

    I have so much more to say but time isn't allowing me to. But do think about who you are and who would you rather have representing your community or youth.

  content: "This is for uh \"To Hell With The Name\", Uh yeah I am Desi, Pakistani
    to be specific, and aside from more traditional Desi music I listen to Pink Floyd,
    I listen to Marvin Gaye, I listen to Hendrix and YES I listen to Bohemia. What
    your saying about Bohemia is similar to what those old conservative White people
    were saying about Hendrix when he was making music, expressing himself, and showing
    his uh, skills. You obviously have a stromg connection to this whole movement
    which Bohemia has created, because you damn near wrote a fuckin thesis on your
    feelings about him. You are just like those old conservative white people who
    thought Hendrix was making nothing but foul, degrading noise. If you do your research
    and actualy pay attention to Bohemia, you will find that he has a great deal of
    substance in his lyrics, not just guns or street shit. So to you I say this: Keep
    on being frustrated that you have to come home from your job every day and sit
    on your little laptop typing your little hate mail which Bohemia will probably
    never even fuckin see!! While Bohemia is out flying around the country doing shows
    and meeting famous people. And Desis like me will sit back reading your arrogant
    (Yet insecure) bullshit and laugh AND support people like Bohemia who bring us
    FORWARD into the spotlight. -If you can define the \"Perception Skills\" of an
    entire ethnic group on your own terms, I think a good rapper can define his Rap
    Skills on his own. \n\n\n\nPS, You seem like a guy who feels very inadequate with
    his own life, to go on a website and talk so much shit about someone you have
    never met. lol\n\n\n\nGO BOHEMIA\n\n-Mike, Educated, Non-Black-Influenced, Classicaly

  content: What the fuck language are you all talking?  It can't be from Earth!!!!  Rap
    is the APITIMY of what "sucks" means. Why the fuck can't you stupid asses "SING?"  I
    don't give a fuck what your argument will consist of, It just sucks really BAD!!!  Some
    of you say "It's not rap, it's hip hop!"  Well here it is in a nut shell....If
    you aren't singing, IT'S RAP!!!!  Rap is for those that CAN'T sing!!!  That's
    pretty bad.  Most of you can't even keep in a real groove.  Then you take songs
    from somebody else and "SLAUGHTER THE SHIT OUT OF IT!"  Which proves one thing....You
    have absolutely NO originallity!!!!  You destroy music that I grew up with and
    then you say "Hey man, check out what I wrote!"  Man, you wrote SHIT!!!  You all
    target kids that don't know any better about music and you make a fortune that
    you DON'T deseve!!!  If you actually made MUSIC, then maybe you could actually
    EARN that money!!!!  What's his face that made that movie "Get rich or die trying"  I
    wouldn't pay shit to see that!!!   Why don't you all try actually singing for
    a change, or are you afraid that you can't and would never make any money?  Also,  Rap
    and music should never be mentioned in the same sentence together (Unless describing
    something like this) There is NO music in rap and and HOW do you "SING" rap????????  To
    rap, means to talk...if you and I are having a conversation, we are having a "RAP"
    session.  That's what RAP means.......TO TALK!!!!!  There is NO singing!!!!  So
    QUIT trying to change the meanings to various words and confusing people that
    actually speak english.  Oh yeah, That STUPID ASS BASS you all like to blast out
    your windows and crank up at home,  Soon, there will be a lot of people responding
    to that.  Since the police don't do nothing about it and it's extemely irritating,
    people are going to start doing what an area of my home town is doing!!!  There
    will be "GAUNTLETS"  that when people line up and down the streets of their neighborhoods
    and arm themselves with rocks,  when you drive through their street, you'll get
    bombed with rocks.  I'm warning you all, KNOCK IT OFF!!!

    fuck this whole bohemia shit. he got hot ass songs but tha nigga aint gonna be on the fuckin T.V. how tha hell people gonna know about him. like couple days ago  i was askin my desi people if they know who is Bohemia they said( what tha fuck is Bohemia ) but when I let them listen to his CD they said that some hot shit. speacilly (kali denail)

    if bohemian wants to get known than he got to come on T.V.like how the spanish rapper are donin there thing. bohemia got to rep us.



     my point is if wants to get known he have to come on MTV OR BET or other american channels

    so american people can know him to and other desi poeple too.

  content: "wow, this is crazy has anyone else heard about this??? is this true?\n\n\n\nRAPPER
    QUESTIONED IN CONNECTION TO SF MURDER\n\nBy LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent\n\nIBA
    News, InsideBayArea.com, Oakland, ca.\n\n \n\nRumors are circulating that the
    SF Police Department brought rapper Bohemia in for questioning, after an associate
    \n\nwho was driving Bohemia's car,was pulled over and arrested for possession
    of an unregistered semi-automatic firearm. \n\nSources say the weapon may have
    been used to commit a murder which occurred in San Francisco in June of 2001.
    That murder \n\nwas believed to have been in retaliation for the execution-style
    killing of Bohemia's close friend, Suresh Mangoli, which \n\ntook place just three
    days earlier. Bohemia recently returned from a press conference in London to promote
    his new album \n\n\"Pesa Nasha Pyar\", which translates to \"Money Drugs Love\".
    He was spotted back stage at Indian pop singers' Raghav \n\nand Juggy D concert
    in Oakland, but when asked about the rumor he declined to comment.\n\nHis producer
    SHA One spoke on his behalf\n\n\"This story is non-sense. That situation was very
    unfortunate, but no one in The Outfit including Bohemia has any knowledge \n\nof
    who was involved. A friend was lost unexpectedly and we had nothing to do with
    any type of so-called retaliation. \n\nPeople see a rapper gaining success and
    they automatically want to associate him with criminal activity and tarnish his
    image.\"\n\n\n\nBohemia's camp claims to have no knowledge of the incident, but
    in 2004 he recorded a tribute song for Mr. Mangoli \n\nwhich accounts in detail,
    a vengeful retaliation against those who killed him. The song, though never \n\nofficially
    released, was leaked on to the internet several months ago. Sgt. Neville Gittens,
    a spokesman for the San \n\nFrancisco Police Department said that he is aware
    of the song and will consider using it as evidence in the now \n\nre-opened case.\n\n\n\nRelated

  content: "Rap artist Bohemia denied entry to Canada\n\n\n\nRapper Bohemia, who was
    scheduled to appear live at the Croatian Cultural Center in Vancouver, was refused
    entry to Canada on Friday and detained for 8 hours in a holding cell by Immigration
    Canada, said the concert promoter.\n\n\n\n\"The version we got from Immigration
    Canada was vague because of their confidentiality and privacy laws,\" said Jhind
    of Dream Time Records LA, who was accompanying The Punjabi Rapper.\n\n\n\n\"Bohemia
    and his entourage arrived Friday at 10 a.m. from Oakland. Every member of his
    entourage was allowed in except him. All the paperwork was fine.\n\n\n\n\"Bohemia
    felt he was waiting too long. You could tell he was getting aggravated,\" Jhind
    said.\n\n\n\n\"He was asked a few questions by the immigration officer and was
    detained and put under watch. Then he was escorted out at 7:00 p.m. the same night.\"\n\n\n\nThrough
    an unconfirmed source, The Punjabi Rapper might have been denied entry into Canada
    because a criminal charge was laid against him two years ago in the United States.\n\n\n\nAn
    official at Immigration Canada said he could not discuss the specifics of individual
    cases, but confirmed the rapper was denied entry into the country.\n\n\n\n\"Normally,
    someone coming here as an entertainer is referred to us,\" said Jean Edmonds,
    manager of Immigration Canada for Vancouver. \"I can't comment on whether he has
    (a criminal record) or not, but individuals with a criminal record would have
    problems entering unless they had prior consent.\"\n\n\n\nOfficials would not
    comment on whether the rapper was detained at the Vancouver airport, but they
    confirmed, \"individuals who are denied entry are sometimes held until the next
    available flight.\"\n\n\n\nAt the Croatian Cultural Center in Vancouver where
    the much anticipated debut appearance was to take place, an announcement was made
    for the crowd, followed by tracks from Bohemia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s latest album
    blasting through the loud speakers. The Punjabi rapper&acirc;&euro;&trade;s follow
    up Sunday performance in Edmonton was also cancelled.\n\n\n\nJhind said Bohemia
    was arrested two years before he tried to enter Canada, but was not sure what
    he has been charged with.\n\n\n\n\"It appeared as it the Canadian Officials had
    his whole Rap Sheet -- it had all his charges listed on it -- I guess they were
    holding him on that and questioning him on that.\n\n\n\nThey kept him in the immigration
    interview for a few hours.\"\n\n\n\nThe 26-year old Bohemia is widely recognized
    as the pioneer of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Desi-Hip-Hip&acirc;&euro;&trade;. His latest
    album &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Pesa Nasha Pyar&acirc;&euro;&trade; [Money, Drugs, Love]
    under the Music Mogul Universal Records India and Ishq Records UK was released
    in April 2006 and remain in the Top Ten for 7 weeks in India. \n\n\n\nMany recent
    performers brought to the city from the U.S. by local promoters have faced hassles
    at the Vancouver International Airport, including Eminem and DJ Clue.\n\n\n\n\"Bohemia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    management is in contact with the Canadian promoters in efforts to organize a
    makeup date,\" Jhind said. \"However, I firmly believe there is a red flag on
    Bohemia's name.  He may not get into Canada even with a minister's pardon due
    to heighten security by Immigration Canada and given his [Bohemia] record.\n\n\n\nMany
    eager fans paid the VIP $65 looking forward to meet the king of Punjabi Rap in-person.\n\n\n\n&Acirc;&copy;

    YO ppls need to check out InnoVAsian, three desi rappers from the UK.



    They are on another level in terms of lyrics and they make the dopest tracks I've heard coming out from  desi mans...fo real, sum of the stuff they touch on in their album is killer.



    Im big on hip-hop n desi music, and int ever seen another act with more chances to crossover n represent us all in the mass music market (unlike jay sean+raghav clowns did looking like cheap rip-offs of existing artists)...



    Check em out on www.myspace.com/innovasianuk



    oh, n they got a rap in urdu...pure poetry!

    I grew up in hoods my whole lyf, from LA to Ny and FL and the Chi and there's
    mo cities in btwn. no lie, but the point iz all minorities need to stick together,
    fuck the white people and lets prove we can do somethin too, than just fight.
    \ Shit, I no not every1 haz to luv Boehima or Pakman or any of dat shti, but fo
    once can the minorities become something to prove dat brown (all shades, lol)
    is strong and we don't need no fuckin white superpower ruling us?  We desi's,
    muslims, etc. have more in common with latinos, blacks, asians, etc. than some
    damn white bitches.  Yea I have my gripes about Bohemia, like any other rapper,
    but I gotta give him props.  He's tryin to rep da real desis dat r out here.  I
    just wish he'd rep his paki self more.  I would luv to hear n see him on urban
    stations (not no fuckin mainstream) and it helps dat hes really fine.  1 of my
    girls whos black iz all into him now, she doesn't no a damn word of punjabi but
    shes like damnnn, dat nigga is fine .  point iz, hes appealing for all minorities
    I think and reppong wit most desis live like in america (and overseas), just like
    most minoroites, in da hood.  Lets try and make it betta, fo ourselves and future
    generations, but dont EVA forget who u r, where u came from and not be some fuckin

  content: "@ Ballu : Want to make one thing clear that Shawn Mixman is nothing more
    than a DJ ... shown is side kick for Sha One is real producer that gave the name
    Bhomia to a street thug called Raja.  As for Shawn.... I think one then music
    he is good at photoshop and putting his picture next to other producers like Dr.
    Zues and DJ Sanj.... Mixman cann't even play any keys ... even Bohemia know how
    to play keyboard."

<p><img src="/images/bohemia.gif" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>In my view, there is no other language more suited to the cadence of gangsta rap than Punjabi. Watch any movie by <a href="http://www.thehotspotonline.com/moviespot/bolly/reviews/m/Maulajat.htm">Sultan Rahi or Mustafa Qureshi</a> and you will encounter the crew chillax in da hood wid a fly ba-donka-donk, rollin' in da benjamins and da bling-bling. Of course, some wanksta will start buggin' or diss  da haps. Oh shizzle. Homie ain't gotz no choice but to busta cap in dat ass wid his k. Shit goes down but ya caynt go against a thug like Rahi. In the end, the homies fire up some shwag and get back to P.H.D.</p>
<p>Ok. I am done. Also, I apologize.</p>
<p>Out of Oakland, which gave us Too $hort (the classic <i>Shorty the Pimp</i> stayed in my car stereo far longer than polite society allows such things), comes Ra aka Raja aka Bohemia, the <a href="http://www.thepunjabirapper.com">Punjabi Rapper</a>. And I say, Why did this not happen sooner!? He raps in Punjabi (<i>Ek adhay sootay nal menoo chrdhi nahi bhang</i>), talks about blunts, hos, interfaith dialogue, pakistan-india cultural unity, faith, hot-roddin, pimpin, and some fly-ass hoochie-mama desi shorties.</p>
<p>Visit his website where you can read about his "journey through true stories of pride and prejudice, giving and greed, poverty and wealth, life, love and murder - desi style."</p>
<p><b>updated</b>: [Jan 3, 2004] Bohemia writes in about what he will be doing in the next few months:<br />
Bohemia chats live on air with dj Sanj on BBC Asian Network's popular, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/asiannetwork/presenters/adil_ray/">Adil Ray</a> show.</p>
