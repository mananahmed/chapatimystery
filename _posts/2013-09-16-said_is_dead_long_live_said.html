<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>On September 27th, I will be moderating an event in CCNY noting the tenth year anniversary of Edward Said. Details on the event are <a href="http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/saidevent/">here</a>. The panelists include our very own Lapata; <a href="http://www.martinespada.net/">Mart√≠n Espada</a>, <a href="http://www.cheemalabar.com/">Chee Malabar</a> (whom you should remember from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/better_with_tablas/hiphopistan.html">here</a>), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AJFaultLines/posts/710871635594819">Anjali Kamat</a>, <a href="http://www.privacysos.org/">Kade Crockford</a>, and <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/faculty-profiles/spencer.html">Robyn Spencer</a>. Here is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/588604751201676/">FB page</a> for the event, should you want to like it. </p>
<p>It bears saying that I am intensely excited about this event, and the gathering. I also want to note that this event is truly a NYC collaboration with CCNY, CUNY, York, Columbia and NYU as well as The New Inquiry and The Asian American Writers' Workshop among the supporters. We all hope to see you there.</p>
