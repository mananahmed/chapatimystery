  content: "Yeah, I saw him speak about this on NDTV a few months before the film
    came out.  The premise as he explained it did not sound promising at all, quite
    stale in fact (hard to believe this is the same chap who wrote Midnight's Children
    and The Satanic Verses); I take it you've seen the extract that appeared in The
    New Yorker?  http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2008/02/25/080225fi_fiction_rushdie"

  content: 'Btw, this whole notion of the "fantasy" Jodha is certainly going to endear
    Rushdie''s novel to the right-wingers who are presently using flimsy excuses ("Hey
    she was really married to Jahangir!") to agitate against the film (it''s patently
    obvious that the real target is the un-controversial fact of Rajput aristocratic
    cooperation/collaboration in the Mughal imperial enterprise).  A ban in Madhya
    Pradesh has been overturned by court order, the one in Rajasthan stays, and a
    day or so ago Uttar Pradesh joined the party (most surprisingly: not only is it
    not ruled by the BJP, but the relevant vote bank -- Rajputs and Thakurs -- is
    not known to vote for the ruling BSP -- but I guess where there is life there
    is hope)...'

  content: "Yeah, I'd read the Shekhawat piece (must say I hadn't known of the Sufi-tinged
    origins of the name), it was a welcome one...  On the Rushdie piece in the
    New Yorker, it's quite mediocre -- the guy has simply lost it with his recent
    novels (I couldn't get to the end of Ground Beneath Her Feet, and reading extracts
    from Fury was all I could stomach; Shalimar was better, but pretty stale).  And
    boy was he pompous on NDTV in the face of a fawning interviewer -- when the latter
    brought up a criticism that Pankaj Mishra had made, Rushdie referred to Indian
    writers who have written a \"book-and-a-half\" and feel compelled to \"slay the
    father\"  (aside: if one must go the Harold Bloom/Anxiety of Influence route,
    one should at least get it right!  The \"father\" for Mishra's purposes is manifestly
    NOT Rushdie, but E.M. Forster's \"Passage to India\" IMO, and more broadly the
    tradition of the \"English novel\")..."

  content: I'm wondering if you can spell out for what your remark about the "Three
    Deep Marks on testicles to the historical narrative" pertains to? I am a lowly
    undergraduate history major with a keen interest in South Asia, and I do enjoy
    your blog. I tend to think Salman Rushdie is rather marvelous and look forward
    to having the time to read his new novel... is this a bit of Tall Poppy Syndrome
    going on here? I mean, of course he's pompous, he's Salman Rushdie. Wouldn't his
    being down to earth constitute something of a letdown?

    is just snark intended to highlight the over-the-top attempt at sexual hijinks
    contained in Rushdie's short story.   Now, my question to you: what is this
    novel everyone keeps talking about? don't tell me he has a book on Akbar coming!"

  content: Well, I followed some of the links in the discussion here and I don't remember
    where it was said, but apparently the NYer makes a habit of excerpting pieces
    from forthcoming novels. Rushdie's forthcoming novel is called "the Enchantress
    of Florence", and has the same miniature painting as came with the excerpt you
    linked to... http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/r/salman-rushdie/enchantress-of-florence.htm

  content: "Yeah he was in India in December and showed up on TV talking about this
    upcoming novel, set in Akbar's India and about a Renaissance European who shows
    up at the Mughal court claiming to be related or some such thing...  On
    that note, Partha Chatterjee's \"A Princely Imposter\" and of course \"The Return
    of Martin Guerre\" are more up my alley...I'd have been more interested if Rushdie
    had done a crazy magic realist version of Dean Mahomet's time in Europe (\"Occidentalism\",
    anyone?)..."

<p>Catching up on my NYer, I see that Salman Rushdie is now doing movie tie-in literature. To coincide with the release of <a href="/archives/talkies/jodhaa_akbar.html">Jodha Akbar</a>, is his maudlin <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2008/02/25/080225fi_fiction_rushdie?printable=true">The Shelter of the World</a>. Finally, someone brings the missing Three Deep Marks on testicles to the historical narrative discovered by the mighty good fillum. Um. Enjoy? </p>
