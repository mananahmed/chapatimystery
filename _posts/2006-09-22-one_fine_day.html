  content: "Happy Birthda, yaara! Always wondered how the B'day concept came to
    our parts of the world. Here is something I have heard and always liked, but never
    sure if it were true.  Maybe you know if it is:  The story goes  that remembering
    the date one is born on is not really of any practical use. So most people in
    most parts of the world, never cared to remember them (my grandmother always told
    me she was born in the summer in the year there was a flood... that's all). In
    our part of the world, then, the Brits required that all males 'register' themselves
    (possibly for later conscription) and so people went and invented 'reasonable'
    birthdates for registration... hence, the very high number of folks in a certain
    generation born of Dec. 25 or Jan. 1....   I suspect this is not entirely
    true, but a cute story nonetheless....."

  content: "Belated happy birthday.   A long long long time ago I discovered
    that birthdays tend to be fairly lucky days.  Anecdotal proof was the fact that
    I had been playing poker with my classmates on a return trip back to Karachi on
    Awami Express and kept on losing till the magic clock turned 12 and the big day
    arrived.    10 years later on the same day I also picked up a desperately
    needed job offer and finally passed my driving license test in California.   Then
    again playing poker and passing a driving test are poor uses of lady luck's company.
      I am sure you did better."

<p>I hate my birthdays and this one provides more to hate than most recent ones. Yet, I am loving this one. Because I get to see my brother in a few hours [haven't hugged him since 2001!]. Rosh Hashanah _and_ Ramadan are here, as well [shalom and mubarak!]. So, joy to all and sundry. </p>
