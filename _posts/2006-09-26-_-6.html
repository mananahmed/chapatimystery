<p>In an amazing display of cultural hipness, The General will be appearing on <a href="http://www.dailyshow.com">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a> tonight. As Stewart quipped last night, 'I have no idea why'. Ostensibly, The General is out promoting his memoirs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Line-Fire-Memoir-Pervez-Musharraf/dp/0743283449/sr=8-12/qid=1159282527/ref=sr_1_12/002-4496624-6797617?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">In the Line of Fire</a> [currently # 3 on amazon! {check out the non-partisan reviews (also, when did amazon start <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/discussion.html/ref=cm_rdp_st_rd/002-4496624-6797617?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0743283449&amp;store=yourstore&amp;cdThread=Tx3JUGD4SKRXQCO&amp;reviewID=RDIABMTOTB2P2&amp;iid=0743283449&amp;displayType=ReviewDetail">comments on reviews</a>?)}].</p>
<p>The memoir is hot especially for this bit of non-news: After 9/11, Dick Armitage told The General that Pakistan will be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/26/AR2006092600439.html">"bombed back to the Stone Age if it failed to help Washington"</a> - which is not a meaningless threat especially if you've _seen_ <a href="http://www.roembus.org/english/journal/Vizita_Geoana_02-2003/MG-Richard_Armitage.jpg">Dick Armitage</a>.</p>
<p>Armitage claims that it is a classic case either of 'selling wares' or 'lost in translation'. According to accounts,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmad">Mahmoud Ahmad</a> told The General over the phone from Washington: "Wo hamari einth sey einth baja dey gain" - a beautiful bit of colloquialism meaning 'they will dismantle us'. It is this news which is all over the internets and interwaves of homistan [though there are other bits of <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/cia-paid-us-for-prisoners-musharraf/2006/09/25/1159036473138.html">interesting info</a>]. Obviously, it plays nicely with a crowd that has about had it with The General. The recent ham-handed killing of Bugti, the 'pact' with the Taliban in Waziristan and more bomb-shells [literally] of A. Q. Khan and it is evident that The General needs good P.R.</p>
<p>I should note, that there was another general who wrote his memoir while in office - General Ayub Khan [ruler dictator of Pakistan 1958 - 1969]. His book, <em>Friends not Masters, a political autobiography</em> was published in 1967.</p>
<p>The writing, as they say, was on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>live-bloggin' the show</strong>: JS offers The General tea! Jasmine tea! Mush is wearing a pakistani pin - looking relaxed and casual. Nice suit.</p>
<p>- JS sets up a softball. "How has it been to hold it together?" "It" being the shiteshow of Pakistani domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<p>- Dick Armitage. Mush says he wanted to make sure Pakistan's national interest was upheld.</p>
<p>- "We did take into consideration a confrontationist approach"!</p>
<p>- Defends his agreement in Waziristan w/ the Taliban factions. Gives an ethnicity lesson. Studio audience asleep.</p>
<p>- "We have eliminated them from our cities" Them = al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>- Break. OK. I think pretty softball all around. JS being super deferential. Mush is a superstar when it comes to dealing with the Western press.</p>
<p>- "It has led certainly to more extremism and terrorism around the world." The IT is Iraq. Man, Bush is not sending any Xmas gifts to Mush.</p>
<p>- "Who would win a popularity vote between GWB and UBL in Pakistan?" "They will both lose miserably."</p>
<p>- Over. The Iraq bit is nice news. I bet it gets picked up at dailyKos. What with all the NIE chatter.</p>
<p>- PS. Colbert is _so_ good.</p>
