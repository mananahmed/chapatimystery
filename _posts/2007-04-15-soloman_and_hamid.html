  content: Wallop, is the way to do it.  And if you need any help, just make her stand
    underneath my window.  Now I realize why destiny has put Gray's Anatomy in my
    possession.

    a book is to be judged by its cover, then...

  content: I just read the excerpt of the book and now this interview but I am glad
    he is saying his(and a lot of other people's) mind.

  content: "That was frustrating.  Solomon takes a rather antagonistic tone, as if
    she wants to debate Hamid on something, but in the end she didn't seem to have
    any point except for a generalized suspicion of his motives.  But I LOVED
    his responses!  If I can pull off that kind of coolness in my next pointless argument,
    I will be happy."

  content: Heard Hamid at his launch last night in DC - at Prose and Politics. Speaks
    very well, answers impressively. House full - not an empty chair. Bought the authgraphed
    book - far too expensive at $22, but what the heck. Dalrymple will have to wait
    till next month...

  content: Funnily enough, I kind of want to whack both of them senseless with a teaspoon.  Maybe
    even a soup-ladle.  The urge sometimes ebbs, but interviews like that escalate
    it again.

  content: OK, so I finished the book last week, and I'm so annoyed at having wasted
    an hour of my life that it almost hurts.  I wonder if I can sue Hamid for negligent
    infliction of emotional distress.

<p>I have a long standing desire to wallop Deborah Soloman. Her latest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnQ4.t.html?ref=magazine">conversation</a> with writer Mohsin Hamid:</p>
<p><b>Like your novel, this interview is a conversation between an American listener and a Pakistani man with a beard. Are we also doomed to misunderstanding? Do you think I'm a C.I.A. agent?</b> If you had short hair and a bulge in your jacket, I might assume you were. </p>
<p><b>Do you think I am mistaking you for a fundamentalist?</b> I don't know. But you are doing me the honor of trying to understand me. </p>
<p><b>I don't know if I trust you.</b> Put that into the piece!</p>
<p>
