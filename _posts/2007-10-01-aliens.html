  content: "All Pakistani boys dress in bright purple, embroidered, bridalesque clothing.
    Did you not know that?  Also, AiA watchers should know that this show was
    screen-tested in a <a href=\"http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/09/aliens-in-ameri.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Chicago high school</a>.  Also: consider that despite the
    Barney Goes Paki \"traditional clothing\", the actor Adhir Kalyan has \"an impressive
    command of languages and accents. He speaks both Afrikaans and French, and has
    wide range of accents, including British, South African, Middle Eastern, Indian,
    Pakistani, Scottish, French and Australian, as well as several American accents.\" "

  content: That's actually called a "poofti." In the minds of Hollywoodians, American
    politicians, American pundits &amp; their gullible prey, it's the traditional
    garb worn by subcontinental male fauna under the age of twenty, before Wahabist
    madrasas issue patchy beards, turbans of indeterminate origin and all-weather
    "Fuck Bush" placards. Fez wore one in the pilot for "That '70's Show," before
    the Fox wardrobe mavens discovered the ratings benefits of pouring Wilder Valderamma
    into vintage Haggar Ballhugger slacks. Fez's poofti was day-glo orange, if memory
    serves.

    \"Many American Muslims are thrilled to see a multi-dimensional Muslim character
    on TV who has nothing to do with terrorism\" says this <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14383616\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">NPR</a> story. I mean, wow. If god ever granted me powers beyond
    my puny control, I will write a Pakistani beer-swivellin, Packer-loving, cow-tipping,
    and surprisingly-not-a-terrorist Muslim character. Huzzah. It will be called \"Memories
    of My Drunk Terrorist Whores\"."

    rel=\"nofollow\">'little mosque on the prairie'</a> has very successfully done,
    i.e. breaking every muslim stereotype they could with very, very intelligent humour.
    but i'm sure because it's a canuck show, hasn't done too well down south. i highly
    recommend you try and catch the show if you haven't seen it already.  p.s.
    i apologize for my horrible grammar."

  content: "Haven't seen the show. But Raja Musharaff, now that's imaginative.  I've
    developed a theory of anyone who spells then name as Musharaff, with a double-f.
    Your post seems to validate it."

<p>Aliens in America premiers tonight on the CW.  Can someone tell me <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2007/10/01/2007-10-01_surrender_to_irresistible_aliens_in_amer.html">what that poor kid is wearing?</a></p>
<p>P.S. Considering it was filmed in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0790603/locations">Pasadena and Vancouver</a>, let's not forget to keep a tally of inaccuracies about Wisconsinites as well as Pakistanis.</p>
<p>P.P.S. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/arts/television/01stan.html?ex=1348891200&en=cae5b0da2a042d68&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Alessandra Stanley places <em>Aliens</em> in the genre of imaginary friend comedies</a>.  As she wisely observes: "Wish fulfillment gone awry is the essence of many a comedy, and there is no wish as potent and deep-seated as the yearning for an imaginary friend."  Thankfully she clarifies this assertion later on in the review with this clarification:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Aliens in America," which begins tonight on CW, follows in the same tradition except that the wished-for best friend is a Muslim exchange student from Pakistan, not a supernatural creature.</p></blockquote>
<p>P.P.P.S.<br />
It seems that the Pakistani character is named Raja Musharaff.  </p>
