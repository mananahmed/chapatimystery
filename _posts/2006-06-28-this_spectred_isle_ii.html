  content: I don't think that -- to try to redeem her wonderful rant -- she was saying
    that Ferguson is driven by messianic desires, but that his arguments are based
    on and in support of actions driven by the messianism of the Administration. Just
    my reading, though. I think paleo rather than neo, too.

  content: "As I read Priyamvada Gopal&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    essay this morning, I had to ask myself: How do we escape the debilitating effects
    of post colonial theory?   While I am sympathetic to Gopal&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    politics and admire her courage in taking on the establishment, let us also not
    forget that it is not only sound byte culture which requires grand theories. In
    fact, like empire even post colonial theory too is predicated on a grand narrative.
    Note, Gopal&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s own short essay
    relies on reading the colonial encounter as &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup2;a
    tale of slavery, plunder, war, corruption, land-grabbing, famines, exploitation,
    indentured labour, impoverishment, massacres, genocide and forced resettlement.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;  Moreover,
    Gopal&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s own way of marshalling
    different thinkers and sociological facts to support her above characterization
    is often problematic. My fear is that in our post-colonial enthusiasm, we might
    forget to ask good questions. Gopal is right when she writes: A collective failure
    of the imagination now makes it difficult for us to think about the globe before
    European and American domination.  If we want to consider possibilities
    that such a globe offered, we might need to ask different kinds of questions.
      Has empire ever been good? Is the term a great city an oxymoron?   Well,
    it might do some good to once in a while to move beyond our obsession with the
    nature of (political) power as we ask these questions."

  content: "JD: \"His aggressive rewriting of history, driven by the messianic fantasies
    of the American right, is being presented as a new revelation.\" I _guess_ one
    can read it either way.   pdcs: word life."

  content: 'Ferguson is a Thatcherite and a Glaswegian Calvinist. I don''t think either
    of those things maps neatly onto American terminology, despite all the mutual
    admiration between Maggie''s crew and the US rightwingers. It seems to me that
    the real trouble is that Ferguson is deeply frustrated both as a Thatcherite and
    an old-style imperialist: born 10 years too late to be part of the rise and triumphs
    of Thatcherism and, worse, about a century too late to be an intrepid British
    Empire builder. So he''s turned to the American neo-imperialists for his power
    fix. In return, they get some intellectual firepower. But I predict a nasty (and
    entertaining...) split in the end.'

<p>Priyamvada Gopal, who previously brought the <a href="/archives/imperial_watch/this_spectred_isle.html">heat</a> to Niall Ferguson, has a new piece up on Guardian's blog, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,1807649,00.html">The story peddled by imperial apologists is a poisonous fairytale</a>. No punches pulled. She calls Ferguson a "neoconservative ideologue" driven by "the messianic fantasies of the American right". Now, I happen to agree with much of Gopal's criticism but I <i>have</i> to insist that such is not the way to engage in a debate about empire - a much needed debate, I might add. Ferguson is not a neocon and he is not driven by messianic fantasies. Whatever else may be wrong with him [and a search on CM alone will point you in the right direction]. So anyways, go read her. </p>
