  content: "<i>\"We don't know what we don't know. And the object is to cut down on
    that,\" said one FBI official who defended the plans.</i>\r\n\r\nWhat I find fascinating
    (and disquieting) about this whole thing is the way <i>ignorance</i> has become
    the enabling factor, the way \"we\" can do what would otherwise be illegal precisely
    <i>because</i> \"we\" don't know what the heck is going on. That's the logic for
    torture too, of course, but extending that logic out from the relatively limited
    spaces of rendition-land into a wide-spread and openly advertised police tactic
    takes it to another level, doesn't it? Plus the opening line has a grammatical
    illogic that betrays the underlying narrative: <i>The Justice Department is considering
    letting the FBI investigate Americans without any evidence of wrongdoing, relying
    instead on a terrorist profile that could single out Muslims, Arabs or other racial
    and ethnic groups.</i> implying that the distinction between \"American\" (who
    have rights) and \"Muslim, Arabs, or other racial groups\" (who do not) is about
    to be officially recognized doctrine."
