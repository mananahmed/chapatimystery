  content: Thanks for sharing it. I used to gaze with wonder at the covers of the
    Saturday Evening Post that carried his paintings at the second-hand books store
    in Lucknow where I went to rent mysteries. It was his America I looked for --
    and thought I found -- when I reached Berkeley in 1957. Lucky me. I wouldn't have
    found it had I come to Chicago first. Did he write anything about that trip?

  content: 'Naim Sahib, Dada ji was not a man of words, so no. But he did a number
    of paintings, including one of Nehru. Sepoy wants me to put that up here, so I
    will do another post presently. I never saw the America of the Saturday Evening
    Post in Berkeley myself, but I''m glad you found it there! I think we have found
    the title of your forthcoming bestselling memoir: Looking at Norman Rockwell in
    Lucknow!'
