  content: I am not convinced that the mullah-military alliance is broken. Its frayed
    and a lot of foot soldiers are dying on both sides, but the high commands on both
    sides understand that they need each other and don't need anyone else as long
    as they have each other (as Rekha says in Kalyug "mein hoon naa"). The army is
    fighting in waziristan and after 3 weeks has killed (by its own account) about
    200 terrorists. They claimed there were 5-10,000 there, so where are the other
    4800? I am afraid they are still focused on "keeping India out of Afghanistan"
    more than they are on keeping terrorism out of Pakistan....

  content: "Ruchira Parl in\r\nhttp://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/\r\n\"I
    sat listening to an early morning TV interview with an Indian engineer who was
    also an amateur astrologer. The man made various predictions about world affairs.
    Two of them have stuck in my memory.  He said that in the upcoming US elections
    the following November (remember this was the year 2000), Al Gore would be the
    winner but there might be some \"problems\" with the results. The other prediction
    he made was that in 2013, India and Pakistan will form a loose federation with
    a common currency and that most hostilities between the two countries will cease.
    I don't believe in either homeopathy or astrology but stranger things have happened.

  content: "Well, you will have to see how many countries HAVE F-16s. \r\nI think
    you will find that in civil wars where well defined areas were completely in the
    hands of a breakaway faction, the national govt has used airpower in many countries
    (Nigeria, Yemen, Iraq, Russia (in Chechnya), Chinese civil war and so on). \r\nbtw,
    one can give some credit to the Indian army that they have managed to fight a
    very serious insurgency in kashmir for 20 years without resort to bombing or artillery
    or even helicopter gunships (well, the last two may have been used on some occasion
    but I dont know of one. I am sure they have never resorted to serious aerial bombardment).
    Of course, they have used torture and detention on an extensive scale, but that
    is par for the course in insurgencies. Even the more highly civilized (and I mean
    that seriously, not sarcastically) British state used torture as well as prolonged
    detention in Northern Ireland, though never on a subcontinental or third world
    scale."
