<p>The flights had been going since 1956, even though they were in direct violation of Paris Convention of 1919, the Havana Convention of 1928 and the Chicago Convention of 1944. The first article of which <a href="http://www.icao.int/icaonet/arch/doc/7300/7300_9ed.pdf">states</a>: "The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory." </p>
<p>The President of United States said the flights "were to assure the safety of the United States and the free world against surprise attack by a power which boasts of its ability to devastate the United States ..." (( <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/our-first-line-of-defense-presidential-reflections-on-us-intelligence/eisenhower.html">Eisenhower in Paris, 1960</a>))</p>
<p>On one of these flights, the American U-2 Reconnaissance plane, piloted by Francis J. Powers, was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-2_Crisis_of_1960">shot down</a> near Sverdlovsk on May 1, 1960. It had been taking off from Peshawer and landing in Norway, since 1956. There were also the anti-aircraft guns stationed in Swat. All this since 1954's sweet CENTO and SEATO deals for Pakistan. You know, for the Soviets. </p>
<p>From U-2 to Drones. (( The Constitution of Pakistan <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part1.notes.html#1">CLEARLY STATES </a> that Pakistan consists of: (a) the Provinces of Baluchistan, the North-West Frontier, the Punjab and Sind; (b) the Islamabad Capital Territory, hereinafter referred to as the Federal Capital; (c) the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and (d) such States and territories as are or may be included in Pakistan, whether by accession or otherwise. You can further find out what the "<a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch3.html">tribal areas</a>" mean. )) We <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2009/02/19/google-image-shows-base-pakistan/">tight</a>, y'all!</p>
