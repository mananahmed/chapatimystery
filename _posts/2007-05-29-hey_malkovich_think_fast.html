    \ and we've kind of met-by-proxy, at least.  get thee to brooklyn!  now
    i feel all obligated to go blog something intelligent, instead of just posting
    lolprofs.  ay."

<p>I have been seriously amiss [um] in acknowledging the [somewhat disconcerting] distinction that friends & gentle readers of CM have bestowed [in service of a meme (those things are still around? {apparently})]: <a href="http://synchroni-cities.blogspot.com/2007/04/twice-tagged.html">It</a> <a href="http://ahistoricality.blogspot.com/2007/04/thinking-blogger-award.html">makes</a> <a href="http://rebecca-goetz.blogspot.com/2007/05/thinking-bloggers-here-i-am-enduring-my.html">them</a> <i>think</i>.</p>
<p>Mucho thanks, folks. As a meme, it has some rules. Like linking to <a href="http://www.thethinkingblog.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html">this</a> post and listing five bloggers who make me think. Well, that's easy enough: <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/">e.</a>, who I can't believe I have yet to meet; <a href="http://www.juancole.com/">juan</a> who I have met and can confirm is a scholar and a gentleman; <a href="http://angryarab.blogspot.com/">angry arab</a>, who amazes me with his wit; <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">joshua</a>, who will be no surprise to anyone but still; and <a href="http://ihatethenyer.blogspot.com/">zp</a>, whose posts I look forward to like none other. Ok, now I can go back to my no-meme rule.</p>
