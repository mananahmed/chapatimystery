  content: Sven, you have just reached pomo nirvana. When you can correctly unify
    Star Trek, the Arabic word (I think it's Arabic--Sepoy?) for foreigner, Chapati
    Mystery and a gun-toting, bible quoting, muscle-car driving writer/lawyer from
    Ohio, you've done your duty to mankind. You may now retire. There is nothing left
    for you. That was your thesis, man.

    farangi, foreigner, not in arabic. but yes in urdu, hindi, hindustani- whatever you call it. in common parlance, refers to the 'white man'. (in arabic you could use ajnabi (stranger/foreigner) or a'jamee (non-arab)).

    by the way, i enjoyed the speech at re-orientations. the audience enjoyed the line about sindhi having 50-something letters. nice job.

  content: "hope you feel better. sorry i missed hearing the speech; just hearing
    about sindhi's many weirdo letters gets me excited.  which invites other, harsher
    comments."

    farangi: your nom de plume is an arabization of "Franks" as those pesky crusaders called themselves - and the Arabs adopted it to mean the whole kit'n'caboodle "West". All white men look alike being a solid theory to this day.

    Sharon & haroon: thanks for the warm and fuzzy. I am back [coughing will continue intermittently; drowsiness is a side-benefit]

    wanderer: you were there and you didn't say hi? i am hurt.

    convinced, cure almost anything up to and including death.
