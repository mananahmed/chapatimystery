  content: "We must commend those who have attempted to bring the truth to the American
    people. Such voices of reason — of truth and justice —
    gives one the hope for humanity. Kathy Kelly, is one such unsung heroes that
    keep probing to get to the thrust of the real problem. In the article linked here,
    she concluded: &ldquo;They must be asking themselves, who are the
    terrorists?&rdquo;  A blogger (Johnny Hempseed) from U.S. post
    a reply: &ldquo;Your last line is a question we in the U.S. should
    have been asking every day since .....1492. Peace&rdquo; Maybe our
    desi &ldquo;brown sahib&rdquo; draws some lessons from
    the true heroes of our time!"

<p>Two inspiring Americans to read about today:</p>
<p>I. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/asia/25kashmir.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">Saving a Kashmiri Village After Remaking His Life</a>, NYT, June 25 2009, tells the story of Todd Shea and his hospital, Comprehensive Disaster Relief Services, in Chikar. There is a video-essay attached to the story that you should watch. Shea's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdrschikar">flickr</a> stream. And a link for you to <a href="http://www.globalgiving.com/projects/pakistan-earthquake-1/">donate directly</a> to his effort. </p>
<p>II. Kathy Kelly and a group of volunteers have just returned from a visit to Pakistan where they toured some of the IDP camps. They belong to <a href="http://vcnv.org/">Voices for Creative Non-Violence</a>. You can read their reports on the site but I want to highlight Kelly's latest, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/06/25-0">Now We See You, Now We Don't</a>. There are also <a href="http://vcnv.org/gallery2/main.php/v/pakistan-+delegation/">photo galleries</a> from their visit. </p>
