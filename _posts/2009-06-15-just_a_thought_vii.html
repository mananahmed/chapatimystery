  content: I am one of those who thought Ahmadinejad would win, because of his advantage
    among rural and working class voters, and because I thought (perhaps incorrectly)
    that Moussevi (an ethnic Azeri) might have a hard time winning over many Persians.  However,
    the haste with which the government has called these elections (barely a couple
    of hours after polls closed) that I am now wondering whether they have made the
    same mistake Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto did in 1977 -- namely rig an election he would
    likely have won?

  content: "Stephen Walt : \"Even if Ahmadinejad would have won fair-and-square, it
    looks to me like the clerics, the military, and the current President all panicked.\"
    http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/06/15/on_irans_election  But this
    piece at Spiegel disagrees. \"Look at the irregularities Mousavi is citing
    now: that they ran out of ballot paper in some polling precincts, that they did
    not keep some polls open long enough. There is no way such things could change
    the overall outcome which is clearly in favor of Ahmadinejad. If you compare this
    to the flaws of the presidential election in Florida in 2000, it seems very insignificant.\"
    http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,630552,00.html  \"While
    Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, initially endorsed the result,
    he has now ordered an investigation into the claims of vote-rigging and has called
    on Mousavi to pursue his appeal \"calmly and legally.\" The powerful Guardian
    Council said on Monday that it would rule within 10 days on the complaints it
    had received.\" [...] \"While security forces did not fire on the protesters,
    images of uniformed men on motorcycles hitting demonstrators with truncheons sent
    a clear message. Ahead of the elections, the hardline Revolutionary Guard had
    already warned that it would not tolerate a \"velvet revolution\" in Iran.\" http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,630515,00.html"

    but the price is very high; for it is not only paid for by the vanquished, it
    is also paid by the victor in terms of his own power." (Hennah Arendt, On Violence)

    and I was reading this safarnama by Mustansar Hussein Tarrar, I guess. He travels
    by road through  Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey into Europe. While in Iran, he mentions
    conversation with   a student who tells him about atrocities of Shah /SAVAK and
    concludes \"It is dark night but dawn is very near \".  Amazing banner and
    the things have come around almost a full circle. Only if Imperial philosophers/generals
    understood human nature.Alas there is neither understanding nor patience.  Here
    is one example  Obama: Iranian voters' voices should be heard  Peaceful
    dissent should never be subject to violence that followed weekend elections that

  content: "Juan Cole had some interesting posts (as always) <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2009/06/class-v-culture-wars-in-iranian.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2009/06/terror-free-tomorro-poll-did-not.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.   Qalandar - you mention why you thought Mousavi
    (an ethnic Azeri) might have a hard time winning over many Persians, but as has
    been pointed out he lost by some 80% even in his home town Tabriz, which has a
    majority Azeri population - something that was really not expected, given the
    Azeri dislike for Ahmadinejad and is just one of the slightly weird twists in
    this election.   I think in most reports before the elections, almost everything
    I read said that  it really was too close to call/ too hard to tell how the election
    was going to pan out - given the lack of any formal, proper exit polls per se
    \ Ahmadinejad's victory should not have come as such a shock, maybe everyone did
    read the mood wrong. But then again, a strong winner  with a 60%+ majority wouldn't
    really need to resort to the kind of tactics that Ahmadinejad has."

  content: "From the Zizek piece, three excerpts that stood out for me were:  \"The
    events in Iran can also be read as a comment on the platitudes of Obama's
    Cairo speech, which focused on the dialogue between religions: no, we don't
    need a dialogue between religions (or civilisations), we need a bond of political
    solidarity between those who struggle for justice in Muslim countries and those
    who participate in the same struggle elsewhere.\"  \"What all this means
    is that there is a genuinely liberatory potential in Islam: we don't
    have to go back to the tenth century to find a 'good'
    Islam, we have it right here, in front of us. The future is uncertain —
    the popular explosion has been contained, and the regime will regain ground. However,
    it will no longer be seen the same way: it will be just one more corrupt authoritarian
    government. Ayatollah Khamenei will lose whatever remained of his status as a
    principled spiritual leader elevated above the fray and appear as what he is —
    one opportunistic politician among many. But whatever the outcome, it is vital
    to keep in mind that we have witnessed a great emancipatory event which doesn't
    fit within the frame of a struggle between pro-Western liberals and anti-Western
    fundamentalists. If we don't see this, if as a consequence
    of our cynical pragmatism, we have lost the capacity to recognise the promise
    of emancipation, we in the West will have entered a post-democratic era, ready
    for our own Ahmadinejads. Italians already know his name: Berlusconi. Others are
    waiting in line.\"  \"What is the reality of this state of emergency? On
    7 August 2007, a crew of seven Tunisian fishermen dropped anchor 30 miles south
    of the island of Lampedusa off Sicily. Awakened by screams, they saw a rubber
    boat crammed with starving people — 44 African migrants, as
    it turned out — on the point of sinking. The captain decided
    to bring them to the nearest port, at Lampedusa, where his entire crew was arrested.
    On 20 September, the fishermen went on trial in Sicily for the crime of 'aiding
    and abetting illegal immigration'. If convicted, they would
    get between one and 15 years in jail. Everyone agreed that the real point of this
    absurd trial was to dissuade other boats from doing the same: no action was taken
    against other fishermen who, when they found themselves in similar situations,
    apparently beat the migrants away with sticks, leaving them to drown. What the
    incident demonstrates is that Agamben's notion of homo sacer
    — the figure excluded from the civil order, who can be killed
    with impunity — is being realised not only in the US war on
    terror, but also in Europe, the supposed bastion of human rights and humanitarianism.\""

  content: "Immanuel Wallerstein on Iranian election - http://www.agenceglobal.com/Article.asp?Id=2086  \"Some
    self-identified members of the world left argue that the supporters of Mousavi
    are largely middle-class and wealthy persons, whereas Ahmadinejad draws his supporters
    from the popular strata. Therefore, they say, a leftist should support Ahmadinejad.
    Some other leftists analyze the situation differently, arguing that this is merely
    a struggle between two varieties of privileged groups, and that Ahmadinejad's
    support in Tehran's poorer zones is largely the result of top down populism (or
    worse still, of bread and circuses &Atilde;&nbsp; la Berlusconi). \" ...\"There
    are two things to be said about popular uprisings wherever they occur. The first
    is that it is never easy for people to go out in the streets to make demands on
    a government to change its policy. All governments are ready to use force against
    such demands, some more speedily than others. So when people do go out in the
    streets, it is never simply because \"outsiders\" are manipulating them. When
    the CIA arranged a coup in Iran in 1953, it did not do it by inducing Iranians
    to go out in the streets. It did it by working behind the scenes with military
    officers. One ought to respect the political autonomy of groups who actually risk
    going out in the streets. It is too easy to blame outside agitators.  On
    the other hand, the second thing to say about popular uprisings is that they are
    always and inevitably a coalition of many elements. Some of the demonstrators
    are those with specific immediate grievances. Some are aiming to change the personnel
    in the government but not the regime as such. And some want to change, that is,
    overthrow, the regime. Popular demonstrations have seldom been composed of an
    ideologically consistent group of persons. Uprisings normally only succeed when
    they are such coalitions. But this always means that the post-uprising outcome
    is inherently uncertain. So the world left has to be careful in offering moral
    and political support to popular uprisings.\""

Iran 2009 = US 2000 or maybe Iran 2009 = US 2006 or maybe Iran 2009 = US 2008 or maybe Iran 2009 = Pakistan 2007.

I especially love the one above, which appeared on NYT. The banner states: Patience, Dawn is Near. I am no expert on Iranian politics but I do know that it is the response of the theo-military junta to the election results which will determine the next few days and, more likely, next few years. That is to say, the more brutal the crackdown, the more severe the backlash. Watch <a href="http://iran.twazzup.com/">the news</a>, gentle readers.<br />
