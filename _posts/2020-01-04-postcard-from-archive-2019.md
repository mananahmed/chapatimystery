2019 was a year of changes and new beginnings for CM. Long overdue, the website [moved](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/change.html) to GitHub (we are still working out the kinks with the move); [Qainchi](https://www.chapatimystery.com/posts/qainchi.html) and [Sonia Qadir](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/Australianama-RT.html) joined CM editorial crew; we started a new series of posts for reporting on South Asian Studies conferences
([here](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/8th_annual_um_pakistan_conference_movement_migration_and_borders.html),
[here](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/matters_of_the_state_conference_report.html),
[here](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/9th_annual_UM_Pakistan_Conference_report.html)).

We published four XQs on first-author books by [Aniruddha Bose](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/xqs_xvi_-_a_conversation_with_aniruddha_bose.html), [Amy Bhatt](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/xqs_xvii_-_a_conversation_with_amy_bhatt.html), [Mubbashir Rizvi](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/xqs_xviii_-_a_conversation_with_mubbashir_rizvi.html), and [Harmony Siganporia](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/xqs_xix_-_a_conversation_with_harmony_siganporia.html).

CM also published two all-female and women-of-color Roundtables, on [Annie Ali Khan](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/in_memoriam_quratulain_ali_khan.html)'s [*Sita Under the Crescent
Moon*](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/roundtableiv_Sita_Under_the_Crescent_Moon.html), and Samia Khatun's [Australianama](https://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/Australianama-RT.html).
