  content: "The hashish picture was superb indeed, and the urgency at the mazaar of
    Daata Ganj Baksh was palpable.  The ones focusing on the situation in the North-West
    were certainly all dramatic and striking, but as the title of your post makes
    clear, a bit predictable.  \r\n\r\nNot so the one with the man sitting with his
    tools/implements on the road-divider with traffic on either side."
