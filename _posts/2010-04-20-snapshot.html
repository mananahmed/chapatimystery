    rel="nofollow">old-style tractors</a> which had belt drive extensions so you could
    use the tractor to power saws and other tools. We are a creative species.

  content: I think you meant "Soft Diplomacy" for the wedding picture, not Democracy.
    Incidentally, the other two men are the cricketer Pataudi, and one of India's
    foremost crooks, Subroto Roy "Sahara".

  content: "Naim sahab: I don't know if Roy is or is not a crook, but do you think
    he is any bigger a crook (or saint) than the other big industrialists?  To be
    honest, I hadn't heard that he was especiall bad/good, hence this is a real question
    (not a rhetorical one)...  Man, I didn't recognize Pataudi until you said
    so: wow, even compared to 10-15 years ago, he looks very different."

  content: "Qalandar, I imagine, money-wise, SRS is probably not among the ten
    wealthiest, but he has plenty of money whose origin has never been fully known.
    He is not an industrialist. Insurance. Real estate. Some say, ponzi schemes. These
    have been his claims.  He has been patronized by all parties and political
    bosses, whose money he is accused of laundering through various deals and ventures.
    Narasimha Rao; Amitabh Bacchan; Amar Singh; Vajpeyi, you name them.  I particularly
    despise him for two reasons. (1) His home base is Lucknow, where he has built
    a city of his own. He publishes an Urdu newspaper from Delhi and Lucknow, which
    caters to the most conservative, religious evelements among the Muslims.  
    And (2) his name appears in bigger letters and more vividly on the the shirts
    of various sportsmen than the word 'India' they claim to be playing for.  His
    profile at: http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/subroto-roy.html"

    Sahara Urdu has multiple editions - not only from Lucknow and Delhi. Subroto
    Roy must be given credit for reviving the Urdu newspaper business in North India
    .   Besides that Sahara also publishes Urdu Magazines too.I don't what came
    of his plans to launch a Urdu Channel though"

  content: "Null, You're absolutely right. That is Sania's father, and not Pataudi.
     Urdu Rashtriya Sahara looks good, reads awful. Except for one columnist (?
    Agha), its contents represent fairly reactionary views. The same is true for its
    Urdu magazine."

  content: I have not read much of the Rashtriya Sahara Urdu version, but after years
    of only hearing about Urdu papers going out of business and/or facing dwindling
    circulation, it was nice to hear of a publication running against the trend, and
    with good production values too.  To be honest I find many other mainstream papers
    (Urdu as well as Hindi) quite reactionary as well, but perhaps you mean that Rashtriya
    Sahara is even more so...I had imagined it as squarely within the "breathless"
    tradition of incident-driven news populism championed by the Hindi news channels,
    or by a Times NOW...

    earlier used to get the Rashtriya Sahara but my newspaper vendor does'nt supply
    it anymore - saying it is not worth getting a  copy for a single customer . This
    infortunately means that you can mostly get access to urdu newspapers only if
    you live in so called 'muslim ghetto'."

    March 2009 at the new Delhi airport terminal...  Thanks for the link, I
    hadn't thought to look!  (Also because I remain loyal to Hyderabad's \"Siasat\",
    which is also online in all its (politically infuriating) glory :-))..."

    or am i seeing pataudi here where there is only a mirza?

    Urdu newspaper. They are found at Bombay, Calcutta, and Hyderabad."

  content: To the extent the idea is that Bombay and Calcutta are not traditional
    "seats" of Urdu culture, that is valid -- but not with respect to Hyderabad, which
    even in the days of Zauq's couplet professing his inability to tear himself away
    from Delhi's charms, was being recognized as a a center of Urdu :-)

  content: While literary Urdu is, sadly, not thriving, as a general matter I don't
    think any major city in India has an Urdu profile as visible as Hyderabad's.  A
    large part of it is that Urdu has long been a second official language of Andhra
    Pradesh's, whereas it had to contend with great resistance in post-1947 U.P.,
    etc.  In recent years Delhi seems to this outsider to have become more accepting
    of the Urdu-facet of its personality, but early days yet...

    do about the population hitting 250 Million.  If any of you would like to
    try though, well please go ahead and good luck on getting it to work."

<p>I know all of you are super-busy, so I won't, like, write 3000 words on the 18th amendment's passage or even 2000 words on what I think will forever be known as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7821082.stm">Last Summer of Water in Pakistan</a>. So, instead, here are the pictures which really, really deserve a lot of words. All were taken from the <a href="http://express.com.pk/epaper/">Urdu Express newspaper</a> over the last 10 days. </p>
