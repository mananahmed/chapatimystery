    Hi Manan. I'm still mad that UChic stole our best stat guy. But I'm also still thinking about our meeting. You were among the boldest who said that great minds and great thoughts would survive whatever the ideological onslaught. I think you're right. I'm betting on it. Thank you for for all you said.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>I went back to L.A. after more than a decade. The traffic still sucks. There is lots of say - because lots was said - about the present and future of academic blogging. I am hesitant to begin describing my thoughts just yet but I am sure that Ben will put some summary up on the site. It was a pleasure hanging out with <a href="http://http://pharyngula.org">PZ Myers</a>, <a href="http://www.serendipit-e.com/blog">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">Danah</a>, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/culture_clash_journalism_and_the_communal_ethos_of_the_blogosphere.html">Brian C.</a>, <a href="http://drcookie.blogspot.com/">Jenny D.</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdishtv.org/">Brian D.</a>, <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go">John Holbo</a>, <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/">Clifford</a> [<a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2005/11/12/academic-blogger-flash-mob/">he took pics</a>], <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/Aboutme.html">John Mohr</a>, <a href="http://www.ojr.org/">Larry Pryor</a>, <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">Karen G.

Since, the old canard is that a kitten dies anytime bloggers talk about blogging; we are responsible for immense feline suffering.</p>
