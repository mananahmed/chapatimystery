  content: This is a terrible atrocity and the perpetrators and their supporters must
    be relentlessly hunted down. Unfortunately, the Indian state is very rickety and
    inefficient and this weakness means that there is a very real threat that Hindu
    fascists will take advantage of the situation. The Indian state must increase
    its ability to defend itself against terrorism, otherwise India's great opportunity
    to rise to greatness will be lost and instead we will get chaos and civil war.

  content: "unfortunately India is surrounded with   partially  failed societies with
    confused cultures   and one autocratic, communist    country . The only  other
    country facing this geographical and political challenge is Israel . but unlike
    Israel , India  has adopted a liberal system ,where  some section have taken advantage
    . No one can predict  these attacks , from USA, Spain  and England  every one
    has faced this challenge.  after ideological confusion of communism, the
    Islamic fundamentalism  is  the new challenge of modern world ."

  content: "I think any inquiry should start with some simple questions  1)
    Who benefits?  2)Is Pakistani eastablishment involved?   Assumption one;
    Pak eastablishment is rational, in that case why open a new front when already
    being targeted by NATO/US on the western front?  Assumption two; Pak eastablishment
    is irrational/suicidal, in that case why are they partners in global war on terrorism? If
    USA/INDIA with all there budget in intelligence and might cannot control these
    fanatics, then how one expects a Pak eastablishment  which is irrational/incompetent
    on verge of bankrupcy to control these fanatics.?  3) Where is the region

  content: "lets look at some knowns and them guess at the unknowns. 1. Obviously,
    Pakistan is going to be blamed in some way for having organized and trained these
    terrorists (or their initial mother organizations) in the first place. Some people
    in Pakistan will complain that the US itself started this monster in Afghanistan,
    but that will not buy them any sympathy. Whatever role the US played, Pakistan's
    \"intelligence\" services (what an ironic term) picked up that ball and ran with
    it. Now, this is their baby and everyone else expects them to do something about
    it. 2. IF the current pakistani government goes out of its way to cooperate
    and IF there is no direct link between current ISI officers and this particular
    operation, they can avoid serious sanctions, but they will face an even more aggressive
    Islamist revolt within Pakistan as this kind of cooperation with the infidel forces
    will go beyond just Afghanistan (which is bad enough in the eyes of the Islamists)
    but will strike at the very heart of the whole jihadi operation in Pakistan. People
    like Hafiz Saeed and Maulana Azhar may have to be shut down. Azhar is already
    outside the official loop, but until now the military has protected Hafiz Saeed
    and his LET operation (presumably by convincing the Americans that these are Kashmir
    specific terrorists and that protecting them is a red line that the Pak army cannot
    cross, etc etc) but this may no longer be tenable. 3. Pakistan will probably
    have to give up Daud Ibrahim. given his longtime links with the ISI, my guess
    is that if he is still in Pakistan he will be handed over dead rather than alive. 4.
    IF the operation was arranged via BD, then BD will also have to take action against
    the Islamists there. Again, the Americans and Indians are actually easier to satisfy
    than the jihdadis. The military regime may face an islamist revolt similar to
    the one the Pak army is already facing.   I will stick my neck out with
    predictions:  1. Pakistan and BD will promise to cooperate and actually WILL
    take action against Jihadis and underworld networks they have hitherto sheltered
    or even assisted. 2. In exchange for this cooperation, they will get more money
    and no serious sanctions will be applied on them by either India or the US led
    coalition. Some cosmetic sabre rattling will no doubt take place. But good sense
    will prevail. 3. The jihadis will be in a state of open war not only with all
    the infidel nations, but also with the current regimes in Pakistan and BD. 4.
    India will survive this crisis and if they can control the impulse to kill a few
    thousand innocent Muslims, they will actually emerge stronger because this will
    lead to some serious reorganization of their extremely primitive and inept security
    services. 5. BD will probably survive an uptick of violence there as well. 6.
    Pakistan will be the biggest loser. If they cooperate with the international community,
    the jihadi insurgency will accelerate and the jihadist section of the establishment
    will fight a messy rearguard action against the pragmatists who will cooperate
    with the anti-jihadist powers. If they dont cooperate, they will be alternately
    pressured and cajoled by the US and its friends and while immediate consequences
    may not be bloody, the long term damage to Pakistan as a member of the international
    community will be very severe. 7. If Pakistan does not cooperate, this WILL
    make things harder for India. Their establishment is as corrupt and inept as ours
    and the pressure to do something will overwhelm their good sense....in that case,
    we may take them down with us....I do think this is the LESS likely scenario.
    I am an optimist."

    First advantage of these attacks to involve India in war on terror because the
    next target of USA and Israel is Pakistan and India have to give something
    in return to USA for giving Nuclear Deal. India is being promised like Afghanies
    in war against RUSSIA. 2 India wants to hide about 70 thousand army send to
    Afghanistan.  3 To stop the Kashmir Freedom movement because international
    comunity was seriously taking notice now. 4 Final to hide about terror attacks
    in Pakistan which were guided from Afghanistan.  Now all Sucide Bombers
    and technology used are coming from Afghanistan and International terrorism have
    increased since USA arrived in this region.  Who is terrorist ?"
