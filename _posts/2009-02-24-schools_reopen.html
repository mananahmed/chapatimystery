  content: "Great pics, thanks for posting.\r\n\r\nNon-sequitur: I note that school
    seems to be written \"skool\" (ph.) here, instead of \"is-kool\" (ph.) -- is that
    the usual spelling of this word (i.e. without the \"alif\")?  I think the textbooks
    on the other side of the border include the alif..."

  content: Schools in Swat are open? So that was it? Give the taliban their due and
    they re-permit girls' education? Something doesn't make sense here...

  content: not to be a party pooper, but there are some significant strings attached.
    Girls schools above grade four may not be open and all girls are supposed to be

    areas, but the point is that the people enforcing rules are the taliban...they
    tend to be rather strict. I expect some examples will be made (eggs broken for
    this omelette already include the 200 or so schools blown up)
