<p>April 8, 2004 is when CM was officially launched to an appreciative audience of well, a few. Here, I found the INITIAL EMAIL ANNOUNCEMENT! *BREAKING NEWS*</p>
<blockquote><p>From: Manan Ahmed<br />
Date: April 13, 2004 2:37:18 AM GMT+02:00<br />
To: manan ahmed<br />
Subject: Chapati Mystery</p>
<p>Dear all!</p>
<p>Pardon the mass email. It will be the last under the "cool" heading that most of you have been suffering from me in the past.<br />
In that regard, I draw your attention to</p>
<p>http://www.chapatimystery.com</p>
<p>this will be my home for a while.<br />
hope to hear from you there.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>manan<br />
ps. i am sepoy. </p></blockquote>
<p>Cute, no?</p>
<p>In the next day or so, I will be posting a HUGE HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT. I would make it now but I don't have the necessary graphic and you know how it is, without fotos, life is just bland.</p>
<p>I love you all, I love Lapata and Farangi and Patwari and everyone who has ever read and commented and shared and liked and spread a word of CM. It really has been an amazing experience and I will write more gushy stuff on this in the MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT etc. </p>
<p>GO PARTY!</p>
