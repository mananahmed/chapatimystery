  content: "sorry to have missed this, if only because I could really use more Walter
    Benjamin in my election coverage.  we in the auxiliary were GOTVing at Penn Station
    all evening and would like to report that while the Hillary folks had a big sign
    and some surly looking union dudes, we had the clear advantage in terms of numbers,
    youth, and teh sexy.  \r\n\r\nanyway, yay lotsa delegates!"
