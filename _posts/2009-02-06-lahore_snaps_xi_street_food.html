    - and also jalebas."

  content: i still like having the anar ka juice in the large beer glass mugs. this
    disposable cup is too modern for me ;)  so many things have changed-  all the
    "pappu burgers" made w/ anda and shami kebab are gone from the Mini Market area
    where i grew up eating them for Rs 5 every week- now, to find them,one has to
    venture into the old city.

<p>Lahore, wouldn't you know, has a geography made entirely of food-stuffs. The natives, even as they partake of second-rate fare will tell you excitedly about the best versions to be found in such and such an alley behind the Civil Secretariat. They will eagerly offer to take you there, so you can admit, that what you are currently consuming is fit only for pigs. I love those conversations. I always tease them - making up fake categories to challenge their assertions. I love the minutiae of personal histories that enable someone to make a better chanaa daal than the other guy. That is the learned history that you will never read in your fancy books, gentle reader. </p>
<p>Then dare I admit that I spend all my time at home? That I didn't really venture out and partake of the famous biryani from Bhatti Gate or the Sri Pa'ia from Shahalmi or whatever from wherever. I shall and you won't think little of me, either. Because I did manage to get to the requests. There is a crew here in Chicago, and we all try to gather semi-regularly to eat Halwa Puri at <a href="http://www.tahoora.com/">Tahoora</a>. Damn fine stuff. They wanted to see how Halwa Puri comes into being on the mean streets of Lahore.<br />
<!--more--><br />
It all begins with this gentleman,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262704/" title="Halwa Puri by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3087/3258262704_5d921cd048.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri" /></a></p>
<p>who tosses the little dough patties into hot oil,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262630/" title="Halwa Puri by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3258262630_df5968a9e4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri" /></a></p>
<p>from whence they are fished out, after a swirl or two,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262842/" title="Halwa Puri by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3367/3258262842_bfc1841b5f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257433409/" title="Halwa Puri by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3449/3257433409_e8b6ae283d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri" /></a></p>
<p>you add some chanaa,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262766/" title="Halwa Puri - Chanaa by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3379/3258262766_08cc52d250.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri - Chanaa" /></a></p>
<p>some halwa,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262810/" title="Halwa Puri by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3258262810_710ddc96ae.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halwa Puri" /></a></p>
<p>and some lassi,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257433629/" title="Lassi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3519/3257433629_717ba44cd3.jpg" width="500" alt="Lassi" /></a></p>
<p>and you have halwa puri, with lassi. Breakfast of Champions. </p>
<p>The other street food that friends were curious about was the neon-glowing sweet called Jaleebi. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258261964/" title="Jaleebi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3491/3258261964_60291f36ff.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jaleebi" /></a></p>
<p>The secret ingredient in the radioactive material which constitutes Jaleebi is, well, sugar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257432771/" title="Jaleebi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3464/3257432771_fbe429d302.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jaleebi" /></a></p>
<p>Into hot oil it goes, through a funnel, poured into the familiar twisty shapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257432793/" title="Jaleebi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/3257432793_b56ec2c6dd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jaleebi" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262042/" title="Jaleebi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3309/3258262042_40918d5367.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jaleebi" /></a></p>
<p>and from it, it emerges. My father, back in the day, loved freshly oiled Jaleebis in Milk. Sugar. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257432857/" title="Jaleebi by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3325/3257432857_be24a2d584.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Jaleebi" /></a></p>
<p>The third, kinda iconic, food of Lahore is really a drink: Pomegranate Juice. Anar ka juice. Looking ahead, I will take you to <a href="/archives/homistan/anarkali.html">Anarkali's "tomb"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262500/" title="Anar  by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3346/3258262500_13600873a0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Anar " /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3258262462/" title="Anar by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3506/3258262462_91f6553395.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Anar" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257433305/" title="Anar by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3257433305_65dd94e2cd.jpg" width="500" alt="Anar" /></a> </p>
<p>And finally, I like the colors on this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3257432683/" title="Colors by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3257432683_f212739769.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Colors" /></a></p>
<p>There are lots more on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72157613334549747/">flickr</a> site. Go see. </p>
