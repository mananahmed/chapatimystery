  content: "Salam,  1. I dont think any work  on All India Muslim League would
    be able to surpass Ayesha Jalal's Sole Spokesman. I am sure you must have come
    across it.   2. Slightly remember reading the book in 80s. I guess I have
    seen it on old book shops in Rawalpindi (my home town). Do tell me if you couldn't
    get it from anywhere and I'll get a copy whenever I go to Rawalpindi and send
    you insha'Allah.  -wassalam"

<p>1. If you, or someone you know, works* on the All India Muslim League or on Muslim nationalism in India more generally or on any thing related to the people or events featured in the Muslim anticolonial movement in India, please contact me as soon as possible. We are planning a colloquium in Novemeber and I would like to extend an invitation for participation.</p>
<p>[* by works, I mean a current or recent graduate student in these here united states.]</p>
<p>2. I need to get my hands on a book published in Delhi [Farid Book Depot]. I was going to have pdcs get it for me BUT, if there are CM readers <b>currently in Delhi or Lahore feeling generous</b>: <i>Sitara jo Toot Gaya: Tarikh-i Islam ke Mo'umr Jarnail Muhammad bin Qasim ki dastan-i jihad</i> by Inayatullah and Altamash. There is either a two volume edition from the 80s or a 2004 single volume. Either will do fine. You will be thanked in stars. </p>
