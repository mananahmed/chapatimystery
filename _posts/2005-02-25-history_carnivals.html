<p>I have been horribly remiss in not pointing out to my readers the <a href="http://historycarnival.blogspot.com/">History Carnivals</a>: <a href="http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2005/01/history-carnival-1/">#1</a>, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/10021.html">#2</a>, and now, <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/detriment/?p=194">#3</a>. Erroneously, I assume that everyone reads the same blogs I do and, hence, knows all these bits. What a dunce I am.</p>
<p>If you like this sort of stuff, and I have been accused of over-indulgence here, I urge you to set aside some time this weekend and read these great entries. And let no man or woman tell you that the blogging world is nothing but a political echo chamber. Little do they know.</p>
