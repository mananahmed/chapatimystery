  content: "Dont' get your hopes up; Indian popular cinema as articulated by Bollywood
    is really hopelessly communal in its understanding of Muslims and the figure of
    the 'Muslim'; it reflects very much conservative Hindu biases; wasn't always like
    this but it has got much worse over the last 20-30 years.   That article
    on Chattisgarh makes painful reading; most of the time the metropolitcan 'security
    experts' and bureacrats have no idea of what is actually happening on the ground.
    The presence of the state at the grassroots level is very minimal and where it
    exists it is very corrupt and exploitative - which unfortunately is the face of
    the state from the 'worm's eye' point of view."

    that conrad has made, so i will stick to my principle on that.   I may
    have been overly harsh, but this is how many of us view of our cinema and it is
    hardly a novel or original criticism. There is a broad literature on this that
    examines a lot the landmark Bollywood films, from  Mughal-Azam, through to Sholay
    onwards. I think one of the best discussions can be found in Ashis Nandy's edited
    volumes \"The Secret Politics of Our Desires\". Of course you don't have to agree
    with this anaylsis but lets not pretend it is somehow an unheard or not oft-remarked
    upon a  feature of Bollywood cinema."

  content: "Although the Pakistani state doesn't condone or permit it, Baloch nationalists
    have been making movies and music videos for quite some time. It's become a whole
    industry called \"inqilabi\" music/film. Go to any DVD/CD store in Karachi's Lyari
    or Lea Market and you will see it on display (some stuff is kept behind the counter
    and has to be asked for).  With the internet now there's no way to stop it. Most
    of the stuff is filmed and recorded in Pakistan without too much trouble from
    the authorities (though many of the artists have been harassed, arrested, and
    gone \"missing\" from time to time).  This guerilla film, Zindan, valourizing
    Baloch separatism was a big hit in Baloch circles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4QXLaQYTA  And

    and what I know about the film, I don't think that is the case.  (http://satyamshot.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/outlook-gulaal-review/)  Conrad:
    that generic description does not do justice to Anurag Kashyap's body of work
    at all.  At All: see Black Friday, No Smoking, and Dev D.  Kashyap is simply not
    part of the mainstream in any meaningful sense."

    \"...it reflects very much conservative Hindu biases; wasn't

    would need to draw a distinction here: the absolute nadir was reached during the
    later 1990s and early part of this decade.  Over the last 5-7 years, however,
    there has been a marked difference in tone, however, most notably in the emergence
    of the \"unmarked\" Muslim (i.e. a character like any other, except that he happens
    to be Muslim) -- in contrast to the earlier stock figures of: (1) the evil jihadi;
    (2) his hyper-nationalistic twin, typically a military or police figure; (3) the
    frail, kindly old man, marked by his religiosity."

  content: "Re: \"Imagine such a commercial movie (if you can imagine a commercial
    movie made in PK) that takes as its premise an out-right revolt against the state.
    Could the Baluchi nationalists project their narrative through celluloid? It isn't
    the fact of creativity (I have read some amazing poetry recently on the Baluchi
    cause that I can share if peeps are interested) but that the state/capital apparatus
    can make space for such imaginations within the public realm...\"  One difference,
    though, is that Gulaal's central premise is the revolt of a region that in fact
    one of the very pillars of \"Indianness\" -- i.e. this is the setting of a political
    fable (a Kashmiri backdrop would be more analogous to your Baluchi example).  Indeed,
    this makes Gulaal all the more daring, because what Kashyap is putting into play
    is not \"the other\" but the untenability of \"the normal\".  Haven't had a chance
    to check the film out yet, but it seems to me that Kashyap's target here is very
    much the fascists who seek to advance a radical agenda under the guise of a \"restoration.\"
    \ A Pakistani analogue to this would be a film channeling the situation in the
    Swat valley, not something like the Baluchi movement..."

    and Hanuman Returns, which obviously don't really deal with any of these themes.
    I accept that he isn't part of the mainstream Bollywood tradition but I haven't
    seen anything to indicate he would handle this topic very differently - I could
    be wrong here.  You are right, in that the 1990s were the absolute worst
    in this regard and that is when I largely gave up on Hindi cinema. The earlier
    decades especially the pre-1970 period were not bad and though mild, had more
    interesting representations of Muslims which weren't so steeped in negative stereotypes.  If
    this trend has been broken over the last few years, then it is a positive development
    and one which I hope continues."

  content: "On this subject, I would highly recommend Black Friday, Kashyap's adaptation
    of Mid-Day journalist Hasan Zaidi's book on the 1993 Bombay blasts.  The interesting
    thing in this film (apart from the fact that it is one of the best Hindi films
    of the decade) is that although in many ways it preserves the logic of the \"psychotic\"
    Muslim terrorist, the agents of the state are ALSO depicted as \"psychotic\";
    especially in the portions set in Bombay (less so the ones in rampur; and least
    convincing of all are the portions set in Pakistan).  My review:  http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2006/11/black-friday-hindi-2004.html"

  content: "PS-- I wouldn't go so far as to say the \"trend has been broken\", merely
    that an additional (and, from my perspective, welcome) strand has been added.  PPS--
    I also wouldn't necessarily agree that the old days were better.  The stereotyping
    of the \"Muslim social\" film in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. \"Chaudhvin ka Chand\";
    \"Mere Mehboob\"), despite its celebration by many Urdu-speakers, was highly problematic
    in itself, transforming Muslim life into something that was always already \"past\"
    (and cloyingly so), in that even though these films were set in the present, they
    seemed like period pieces; perhaps we may say it was the timelessness of the ghetto.
    \ The fact that Yusuf Khan had to go around as Dilip Kumar during the period itself
    speaks volumes (on this, at least, the world has unquestionably changed for the
    better; not only would no Muslim actor dream of changing his name to a Hindu one
    today, but just about everyone knows that A.R. Rahman has himself converted from
    Hinduism).  Aside: My mother tells me that during the 1960s there was a
    Pakistani actor who adopted a Hindu screen name even though he was Muslim, a tidbit
    I found fascinating.  Can anyone corroborate?"

  content: "LOL, you give me hope and then you snatch it away!  I didn't mean
    to say that older films weren't stereotypical in their portrayals of Muslims but
    only that they weren't characterised by negative stereotypes. In general films
    of this period tended to typecast roles that relied on their ethnicity or religion
    as markers but not in a crass negative way which we see today. I still remember
    seeing \"Hindustan Ki Kasam\" (the Raj Kumar version) which was remarkable for
    the way that the Indo-Pak rivalry was seen almost as a family quarrel without
    the communalisation of the nationalisms involved. while within the bounds of mainstream
    Indian nationalism there was no easily demonisation of the enemy as the perfidious
    Muslim which we see in today's war films. The last 'war' movie I saw was one whose
    name I forget but which had the hero as a paramilitary officer see action in several
    different setting from the jungles of the north-east, against Tamil separatists
    in the South, internal policing in some village and finally the LoC in Kashmir.
    In EVERY single case the opposing side were cast as some sort of semi-demonic
    entitiy, inhuman killing machines or dastardly terrorists.  Of course many
    films that could be characterised as \"Muslim\" films were period films like Mughal-e-Azam,
    Anarkali and Razia Sultan or had many Muslim aspects like Pakeezah. I think your
    description of  Chaudvin Ka Chand is somewhat harsh since that was the general
    attitude of Hindi cinema to most aspects of 'traditional life' Hindu or Muslim
    which tended to be idealised a lot. But I am biased because I really like Guru
    Dutt.  It was possible for Muslims to have a 'normalised' role as you say
    in some of the films; the sidekick Sher Khan in \"Zanjeer\" or one of the two
    hero-theives in  \"Imman Dhamram\". There also was a lot of underlying Muslim
    imagery that underpinned many films from this period - one example is the good
    luck charm (786) the gangster brother is given by a Muslim dockworker he saved
    and which saves his life several times until he loses it and is fatally wounded
    in \"Deewar\". Some notable films also had Muslim portrayed as the heroes, villains
    and heroines without much weight attached to their religion per se such as \"Coolie\"
    and there was of course the cheesy \"Amar, Akbar, Anthony\" variety that in classic
    Nehruvian fashion told us we could just get along if we overlooked our religious
    differences. BTW I realise most of these films are Amitabh Bachchan vehicles,
    this is not out of personal taste but simply because these were the films most
    popular growing up and hence inflicted upone me :)  Yes, the example of
    Dilip Kumar speaks to the limits of  acceptaility in those - for actors at least;
    Muslim actresses like Waheeda Rehman and Nargis didn't face the same problem.
    This has changed for the better, though I can't help but be depressed at the throngs
    of Bollywood stars eager to campaign for the BJP and to a lesser degree (and really
    not much better from a communal point of view) the Congress. Unlike many other
    countries, the movie industry does not seem to be a source of political liberalism
    or tolerance. With some exceptions of course."

  content: "Not very many stars shill for the BJP: only a few has-beens like Shatrugan
    Sinha, Vinod Khanna, and Dharmendra among the men, and Juhi Chawla and Hema Malini
    among the women.  Despite the party's desperate attempts years ago to woo amitabh,
    the Bachchan clan has resolutely stuck to the Samajwadi Party (Amitabh publicly
    snubbed then-PM Vajpayee by bailing on his book launch, leaving a prominently
    empty seat next to the PM in the subsequent TV coverage; Aishwariya Rai-Bachchan
    even campaigned for Samajwadi ally Badruddin Nizami's largely Muslim party in
    the Assam assembly elections); and even in the midst of the post-Mumbai attack
    atmosphere with tensions running high, Aamir Khan came out with a blog post that
    didn't just blame all politicians as was pretty common at the time, but made it
    a point to mention that the BJP was worse than the Congress.  Re: \"Unlike
    many other countries, the movie industry does not seem to be a source of political
    liberalism or tolerance. With some exceptions of course.\"  This is not
    a fair statement; in most countries, the movie industry is only a source of personal
    liberalism/tolerance, not necessarily of political liberalism -- the same holds
    true in Bollywood too (in Hollywood, for instance, safe subjects such as gay rights,
    Holocaust, etc., will be tackled; but very very few had anything to say about
    (e.g.) the war in Iraq until it started going badly, and it became the conventional
    wisdom).  There is simply no evidence that Bollywood has a worse record than a
    Hollywood in this respect, especially when one factors in the greater nastiness
    of Indian politicians (and hence the correspondingly greater vulnerability of
    Indian actors)."

    will say that the current scenario offers a lot more hope than it did 7-10 years.
    \ The crass negativity (as opposed to what I was talking about, problematic stereotyping)
    has for the most part not been visible for the last few years...  Aside:
    Muslims actually have it better than some others.  Dalits, for instance, are characterized
    by an utter absence from Hindi cinematic representations (Rekha in Ganga ki Saugandh;
    Devika Rani in Achoot Kanya; and Madhumati; are the only instances I can think
    of in 70+ years -- all are women.  Heck Kailash Kher (who campaigns for the BSP,
    btw) is the only Dalit Bollywood celebrity I can think of))."

    is the Hindu for that matter; one might usefully think about it under the sign
    of the "metropolitan" (who imagined himself de-racinated) encountering the permanently
    "ethnic", but that's a different issue, although an increasingly common one in
    Bollywood) -- and in fact the representations are a lot more sophisticated than
    in the director's previous film, Rang de Basanti...

  content: "FFS had a huge reply typed out and then lost it :( I will recapt the main
    points here as I don't have time to redo everything.  1) Not many stars
    directly campaign for the BJPO, this is true; but my point was that many of them,
    particularly the Hindu ones, tend to favour a sort of soft, bourgeois variant
    of saffronist nationalism. This comes across in many of their interviews and private
    statements. I think this is a typical reaction of a segment of the middle class
    in India and one of the reasons why the BJP/Hindu nationalism enjoyed such a surge
    in support so quickly - this segment stopped supporting the Congress, which had
    pandered to it, especially at the local level and switched to the BJP. the fact
    that most actors/actresses support either the BJP or the Congress speaks volumes
    imo about their basic mindset imo. I can't accept the example of Amitabh Bachchan,
    so he didn't support the BJP so what? He joined the Congress at a low nadir when
    it was communalising relations between religious communities, hobnobs with crytpo-wannabe
    fascists like Bal Thackeray and the only reason he is with the SP is because of
    Amar Singh and the latters efforts to save him from bankruptcy not because of
    any ideological commitment to anti-communalism. This buffoon became a political
    laughing stock in UP before the 2007 assembly elections with his ridiculous adverts
    on behalf of the UP state govt (in reality the SP) that there was no/little crime
    in UP. I was in UP at the time and no one took this clown seriously. I don't think
    he should be used as a yardstick to measure political commitment (not that this
    is what you did but just wanted to mention it).  2) I just don't agree with
    you about Hollywood et al. I don't think US or European cinema is some bastion
    of rebellion but it is broadly liberal rather than conservative, esepcially on
    domestic issues. Even in Hollywood there a number of topics from the 1980s where
    I would say in the national spectrum it was more progressive than conservative;
    issues like race-relations, racism, gender violence, US policy in the Central
    Americas. Quite a sizeable segment of Hollywood made continous interventions in
    public on behalf of these causes. And I am sorry but there were prominent figures
    who were critical of the Bush admin way before the invasion of Iraq - and I don't
    just mean the usual suspects of Penn, Robbins, Sarandon, Glover and Baldwin. By
    contrast openly conservative figures are a minority - Heston (now dead), Woods,
    Scott and who else? By Contrast do we really see mainstream Bollywood actors and
    actresses taking unpopular or controversial political stands? They might defend
    themselves from criticism from social conservatives like Shetty but how many could
    be said to have taken up some causes to increase social awareness as opposed to
    some PR-related charity work? I can only think of Rahul Bose, who has done this
    (though I haven't kept up with events for a while on this front) and Naseerhuddin
    Shah with to an extent Dilip Kumar from an earlier period. Indian politicians
    'nastier' than American ones?! The right in the US can be pretty vitriolic too
    and if one doesn't have any political ambitions, being a mainstream and successful
    actor is one of the few positions of privelege you can speak out from. If they
    feel intimidated, I don't think ordinary people have much chance. If writers like
    Arundhati Roy and Maheswati Devi can challenge the state, I don't think actors
    can cry off so easily (I am not asking them to be martyrs here but some activism
    on progressive causes which just isn't token would be nice).  3) Yes, of
    course Dalits and adivasis are the real invisibles of the Hindi cinematic representation
    and like with Muslims their portrayal tends to be problematic when it does occur.
    There some notable examples you omit here; the Dalit cripple in \"Lagaan\" who
    eventually is allowed to join the villagers cricket team against the British is
    one, but this is a condescending and in many ways insulting representation when
    you think about it which angered many Dalit intellectuals (rightly). There are
    also the social filsm which are somewhat better in this regard- Bimal Roy's \"Sujata\"
    is remarkable for its direct tackling of casteism and for doing it at such an
    early period in Hindi cinema. This story of an inter-caste marriage between a
    Brahmin man and a Dalit girl is an important contribution to the issue and is
    well acted and scored. Some of Satyajit Ray's films cover the exploitative nature
    of mainstream Hindu society with the adivasis as in \"Ari Din Yatri\". Ironically
    these days even when there there are films about dalits like the forthcoming \"Ye
    \ Hausla\" it is difficult to get Dalit actors or actresses to play these roles
    (Sameera Reddy selected in this case).   Caste remains one of the final
    frontiers to breach for Bollywood cinema - I think though regional cinema is better
    on this score."

  content: "Re: (1): you are entirely unfair to Amitabh Bachchan, who joined the Samajwadi
    before Amar Singh was anybody there.  In fact his initial ties were with Mulayam
    Singh Yadav, and only over the last few years has Amar Singh come to the fore.
    \ Amitabh's anti-communalism is definitely a part of the story (his joining of
    the Congress was likely the result of his personal friendship with the Gandhis,
    and I doubt ideology played a role there; but ideology is unquestionably part
    of the reason for his distance from the BJP).   Amitabh, at least in the context
    of U.P. politics, was and is associated with the most pro-Muslim political formation
    in the state (that formation is itself bankrupt and a far cry from Ram Manohar
    Lohia's promise, but that's a different story).  You mention the 2007 assembly
    elections -- you might also mention his stellar work in urging Muslim communities
    in eastern U.P. who had been boycotting the polio vaccine due to rumors that it
    was a sterilization plot, to trust the vaccine (Bachchan was called in after even
    clerics weren't having the desired impact; and his campaign turned things around
    in a huge way).  He is not a model of political engagement -- but you dismiss
    his contributions as nothing but a big zero, which is grossly unfair.  [Citing
    Dilip Kumar and Naseer as  counter-examples is pretty amusing; certainly I am
    not aware of the sort of engagement on their part that we have seen from Rahul
    Bose and Nandita Das, or even from a far more \"mainstream\" figure like Javed
    Akhtar.]  I think it is reductive and grossly unfair to characterize B'wood
    celebrities on the whole as \"tend to favour a sort of soft, bourgeois variant
    of saffronist nationalism. This comes across in many of their interviews and private
    statements. I think this is a typical reaction of a segment of the middle class
    in India and one of the reasons why the BJP/Hindu nationalism enjoyed such a surge
    in support so quickly - this segment stopped supporting the Congress, which had
    pandered to it, especially at the local level and switched to the BJP.\"  I guess
    we see it differently and I'll leave it at that."

  content: "PS--  I left out Lagaan and its insulting portrayal deliberately, because
    I was only referring to films where one of the leads is a dalit character.  [Aside:
    Sultan Ahmed's Ganga ki Saugandh (1978), and its imagining of a Dalit/Muslim/Brahmin
    alliance against an oppressive thakur, and its boldness on Islamic \"egalitarianism\"
    as some sort of anti-casteist force, was in many ways a prescient representation
    of U.P.'s emerging caste-formations over the next few decades.  This film is today
    all but forgotten in urban India, but it was a huge hit at the time, and I would
    guess continues to resonate in milieus far removed from Bombay and Delhi multiplexes.
    While this film too can certainly be critiqued for positing a virtuous upper-caste
    man as leader of the rebellion (rather than someone from the Dalit community shown
    in the film), the representation of Dalits is vastly better than in Lagaan, over
    two decades later.]  Aside 2: personally I think the greatest \"mainstream\"
    Hindi film of the last 25-30 years is J.P. Dutta's Ghulami, positively Homeric
    in its sweep and yet searing in its anger."

  content: Where I think we agree is that most celebrities do not use their positions
    of privilege for any constructive interventions (whatever one might say, Aamir
    Khan is better than others in this respect).  However, this cowardice does not
    lead me to believe that these celebrities are basically on the BJP bandwagon (the
    ones who are are well known to be so).   In Hollywood, interventions vis-a-vis
    Central America I am not familiar with, and I defer to you on those; but my impression
    is that they tend to play it very safe (I mean, what can one say about an Academy
    that  cannot even bring itself to award "Waltz with Bashir", preferring the far
    safer "departures"?)...

  content: While many Bollywood celebrities lack the sophistication/coherence of a
    Sean Penn, sarandon, clooney or so, I think it is no less gutsy of an Akshay Kumar
    to take the stand (as he did some years ago) that he would not utter any Paki-bashing
    dialogues; this was a non-trivial gesture when one considers that as an action
    hero (as he was back then), akshay was a logical candidate for many of the films
    that featured pakistani jihadis as bad guys etc.  [Urmila Matondkar later joined
    him in this refusal, although it isn't clear what she was being offered to begin
    with].  And the industry figures who are clearly critical of the Hindu right include
    Aamir Khan (on an unrelated note, his advocacy on behalf of the Narmada displaced,
    and subsequent refusal to apologize to Modi, got his films banned in Gujarat;
    he remained unyielding), and directors Raj Kumar Santoshi (his 2004 film Khakee,
    starring both Amitabh and Akshay, remains the best masala movie indictment of
    the hysteria of the "national security state", and is IMO one of the best Hindi
    films of the decade), Rakeysh Mehra (via his films, not his interviews), and of
    course Govind Nihalani (Dev was also a powerful, if somewhat uncinematic film);
    it is unimaginable that Sanjay Dutt (who recently joined the Samajwadi as well,
    and will oddly enough be contesting from Lucknow) could be other than hostile
    to those political formations.  Some of the not-so-powerful (Gul Panang, Rahul
    Bose, Nandita Das) have, as you mentioned, acquitted themselves even better...

  content: "Hmmm, actually I was in Poorvanchal in 2006 and 2007 but was based in
    some remote villages for fieldwork; so I didn't know about
    Bachchan's role in the polio vaccine coverage. I don't
    know who has told you it was a success, in Kushinagar and Deoria it certainly
    was not, at least on the ground, no matter what official statistics would say.
    We can differ on his connection to the SP, that wasn't the
    understanding I have of it; but certainly his ad campaign and support for the
    Mulayam Singh govt of that admin really reinforced the impression amongst many
    that he was supporting a govt that was heavily criminalised —
    of course most govts are but Mulayam Singh took it to a new level. In one poll
    gathering I attended, he was reduced to literally apologising for the behaviour
    of his MLAs in the two bordering constituencies because of their actions. Also
    AB's support for the Congress, of course it was motivated by
    his closeness to the Gandhi family; I don't think it makes
    it any better if one knew what the Congress govt of the 80s in UP was like and
    what it did to cover up the anti-Muslim pogroms of the PAC. I am sorry I just
    can't let that go; you can dismiss it lightly but it was a
    real shock to me and was the time I just stopped watching his films (quite liked
    him till then). Can't explain what a poisoned atmosphere it
    was then and just how terrified many Muslim communities were of the police, who
    effectively were getting away with murder. The whole brouhahah over AB's
    supposed challenge to VP Singh one of the few decent politicians and the antics
    of the Congress thugs towards the latter just made things more distasteful. I
    am not blaming AB for this and neither was he the cause, nor did he approve any
    of these actions; but he continued to associate himself with a regime that did
    and never spoke a word in criticism and for that I certainly can't
    have the meliorist view you have of him.  Yeah, we can differ on Bollywood
    celebs; perhaps I am too harsh on them but really very few of them are progressive
    or liberal in any genuine way. Aamir Khan, yes, you are right but he is a relative
    rarity. Obviously, though I don't want to be crude about it,
    I would expect figures from the minority community (Muslims and Christians here)
    to be more progressive at least as regards communalism than many of their Hindu
    counterparts. And here we don't really have a lot of names
    do we — I mean ok Akshay Kumar says he isn't
    going to use anti-Pak dialog in his films — fair does and kudos
    for him but this is the best we can come up with? Please, can't
    we do better. The other figures you cite are all directors or as you say secondary-tier
    actors/actresses. If we were to look at the top 50 or so stars I doubt we could
    come up with more than a handful that could be described as liberal or progressive
    in a meaningful sense, most would be indifferent and a fair few would either by
    BJP types or inclined that way. No way would this be true of European cinema or
    Hollywood. I might be overly harsh on Bollywood since as you say my main engagement
    came in the 90s, after which I grew sick of it and stopped watching in the main
    and the situation was by far much worse. But if things aren't
    as bad as you say they are — isn't it odd
    that we haven't managed to make a decent film that portrays
    Muslims and other minorities in a sensitive but entertaining fashion? What films
    do exist in this trend are either arthouse productions or come from regional cinema.
    I don't think we have been anywhere near as honest as tackling
    issues like communalism or caste; whereas there have been efforts to tackle the
    issue of racism and class European and American cinema (though not class so much).  Re
    Dalits in cinema — there were a raft of 'social'
    films that examined the problem of caste discrimination that came out in the 1950s
    and early 60s, I forget many of them now mainly because they were preachy and
    not very good, Sujata being the exception. There was also the biopic of Ambedkar
    with Mamooly — which is extremely hard to get hold of for some
    reason even though the NFB funded it. And we shouldn't forget
    Shyam Benegal's Ankur which has Dalits as the lead roles.  I
    haven't seen Khakee though my father sent me a DVD of it —
    AB's picture on the front out me off but off your recommendation
    I will check it out — and blame you if it disappoint :D"

  content: "The Mammooty biopic by Jabbar Patel is tedious as a cinematic matter,
    but it's a welcome film -- I was lucky enough to get to see it at an Asia society
    screening.  And Mammooty is such a wonderful actor it was a joy to see him essay
    the role.  Not to nit pick, but on the ad campaign (which was indeed a disaster),
    the reason those ads were able to survive legal challenge from the BSP is because
    even Central government statistics showed that per capita, U.P. was in fact among
    the lower-crime states in the country -- nevertheless the ads were lame and the
    BSP was successfully able to paint them as lies/idiotic, but they were colorable
    (lies, damn lies, and statistics, and all that...)  Aside: I see where you
    are coming from re: the PAC pogroms, and I do empathize; but it is equally undeniable
    that the post-BJP Congress of today is not \"the same as\" the BJP (this is not
    for reasons of principle, but electoral logic: once upon a time such tactics might
    have helped the party; now, the benefit of any pogroms would be reaped by the
    BJP; and of course the Congress is basically extinct in U.P. :-))   But back to
    this question of the film industry, there is simply no evidence for your assertion
    that more are sympathetic to the BJP than to a more liberal outlook -- it seems
    to me you are inferring the former from the fact that cowardice, imbecility, and
    opportunism appear to reign supreme, but I don't see that as a tenable inference
    (obviously not talking about the likes of Nana Patekar here, who is a member of
    the Shiv Sena, though perversely Nana makes more secular public utterances than
    many others).  My point on amitabh was not to hold him up as some kind of engaged
    figure, but to make the point that, within the context of Indian politics and
    celebrities -- the sorts of morally compromised relationships with dubious politicians
    that you point to are not inconsistent with personal liberalism.  This is sad
    but true: after all, even arundhati roy raised nowhere near as much of a stink
    about Nandigram as she does about brutality by right-wingers, and in her recent
    piece advocating azaadi for Kashmir in Outlook, seemed willing to accord the Kashmiri
    separatists the benefit of the doubt to an extent she would not, I suspect, be
    grant other Indian politicians; Aamir Khan was criticized by pro-Tibetan activists
    for participating in the Olympic torch relay, and surely he is not going to criticize
    the Congress as harshly as he does the BJP, is he?  and now the CPI(M) is going
    to tie up with Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal, who till yesterday were the BJP's ally
    and whose role in anti-Christian violence can charitably be described as passively
    complicit.  Yet if I were to infer a lack of secularism on the part of Prakash
    Karat, I don't think that would be accurate.  On Amitabh and the Congress (or
    anyone and the Congress), one didn't need to wait till the Hashimpura etc. massacres
    -- what was left to be said after the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms?  [Personally, and
    this is off-topic, that sort of thing is why, despite the degenerate thuggery
    and intellectual bankruptcy, I've always had more of a soft spot for the BSP and
    Samajwadi (more the former) than the Congress when it comes to U.P. (and, as I'm
    sure you remember, Mayawati campaigned for Modi in 2002, to preserve the alliance
    with the BJP in U.P.).  Perhaps you are right that Western celebrities are
    more engaged, but if we are going to judge celebrities by their blind spots, shouldn't
    the Israeli-Palestinian dispute come into play?  I have seen nothing on that front
    (I mention that conflict because it is easily the most famous one from the American
    perspective); heck Hollywood used to routinely make apologias for the IRA too
    (as late as \"The Devil's Own\").  The activism that is on display is all too
    often of the \"safe\" variety -- I don't judge them for it, but, accounting for
    the differences in political nastiness (yes, the right in america can be vitriolic,
    but the right in India is deadly; think of bottles thrown at Amitabh's house,
    at the violence unleashed by even a minor figure like Raj Thackeray against the
    Bachchans' remarks last year, at the Shiv Sena activists showing up outside Dilip
    Kumar's house to hurl abuse and possibly do worse; the Gujarat ban on Aamir's
    films; the Samajwadi hooligans outside SRK's house, etc.; especially where female
    celebrities are concerned, courting political controversy can be dicey), I just
    don't see a difference in kind (the really committed folks like Clooney do have
    analogues in Bombay too, but these are exceptions).  Anyways, not to go
    around in circles, we see this situation differently; but I do recommend that
    you check out some contemporary Hindi films, as otherwise it is easy for one's
    impression to be fixed by films from the past.  Translation: check Khakee out;
    it is an outright masala movie, but in the grand old tradition -- and Bachchan's
    presence there makes perfect sense, given the cinematic history his cop persona
    taps into; I assume you've seen Dev?  This film had the dubious distinction of
    being bashed by both left and right in India, but personally I thought it was
    damn good, if too much like a stage-play."

  content: "RE: regional cinema being better than mainstream Hindi cinema regarding
    the portrayal of Dalits characters and actors, an old 90s film I would recommend
    is Jabbar Patel's Marathi film \"Mukta\". It is very hammy and somewhat predictable
    staging of Brahman-Maratha-Dalit characters and their positions, but has some
    unexpected moments by thinking of intersections between racism and black anger
    (there is an African-American character who unfortunately sounds totally Jamaican),
    Dalit panthers and the Bhakti poetry of \"untouchable\" poets like Chokhamela.
    (I don't know if a subtitled version is available, alas.)    PS: really

  content: Thanks DK -- unfortunately, the subtitle situation with Marathi films is
    a rather difficult one;  but I do remember seeing a 2002 film called Vastupurush
    that touched upon inter-caste relations.  Not directly relevant, but a superb
    representation of the mindset of a dying feudalism (and a great movie) is Adoor
    Gopalakrishnan's Elippathayam (released on DVD in the West as The Rat Trap), as
    far as I know one of only two Adoor films available with subtitles...

  content: "Qalander,  Arrgghgh, lost most of my reply again on my wretched
    computer, so will just jot down the main points from what I can remember since
    I am too lazy to bash the whole thing out again :P  1)\tYes, Jabbar Patel's
    biopic wasn't really great cinemea but I think it is important
    was that a film on a seminal Dalit figure like Ambedkar was made. I think it has
    immense value, especially since most Dalits have very little direct familiarity
    with much of Ambedkar's thought or writings but only encounter
    him as a statue, a public figure of history and whatever watered down mash the
    BSP serves to them for their own ends. There was another biopic of Ambedkar but
    I haven't had the chance to see it.  2)\tThe ad campaign
    was just stupid; anybody who knew the reality of UP at that time knew this. I
    can't believe you are quoting me those figures with a straight
    face — are we seriously going to take those statistics at face
    value. In any case, given UP's mammoth size population and
    rural population such averages can conceal a relatively high crime rate. Not to
    mention the other problems, I remember during the elections I was in a small town
    near Gorakhpur and the SP candidate rolled by with his party workers armed to
    the teeth, when out of nowhere the DM showed up with a few truckloads of police
    and confiscated the weapons and took the candidate into custody. I commented how
    impressive the police were in acting quickly; my friends who were from the region
    just looked at me oddly and said that the only reason it happened was because
    of the EC strictures which put in place rigid guidelines on the electoral procedures
    and the fact that the centre had dispatched battalions of CRPF police to oversee
    the elections — a passing observer piped in with the comment
    that it was no use relying on the UP police since they were the worst criminals
    in the state!   3)\tYes, of course the BJP has toned down its antics
    as it has had to adjust to the reality of coalition politics and the Hindutva
    programme ran into its own constraints, not to mention how hollow the 'party'
    with a difference claims sounded once people saw just how similar to the other
    corrupt and incompetent govts the BJP were actually like once in power. But when
    their stars were riding high and it was in the ascendant, many critical voices
    were notably absent in opposing them. It is probably safer to take a stand against
    them now than it was in the 1990s; since there is little hope of them gaining
    unadulterated power at the national level especially and with the rise of regional
    and lower caste movements, they have been checked to a large degree.   4)\tI
    don't think it is fair to say that Arundhati Roy has not been
    that critical on Nandigram; she has been on that divide on the left along with
    Sumit Sarkar, Maheswati Devi, Tanika Sarkar et al. Who actually attacked the CPI(M)
    and the left in general over its actions in Nandigram and Singur and over forcible
    land acquisition as well as the silence of many other left academics. The sickening,
    &ldquo;both sides should stop the violence&rdquo; approach
    mouthed by Left-orientated academics like Jayati Ghosh which was a de facto way
    of supporting the CPI(M) was truly revolting and an abdication of responsibility
    to tell truth to power that committed intellectuals should have. They were also
    critical of intellectuals like Chomsky, Zinn and Bello who urged unity in the
    name of resisting 'neo-liberal forces' in
    West Bengal. Nandigram was an important dividing issue and it was disappointing
    that so many public figures who would have otherwise have spoken out if it had
    been any other state govt, chose to keep quiet because here it was a LF govt involved.
    The JNU set were a real let down in this regard and some of them have become too
    close to specific parties like the CPI (M) for their own good. Roy has her own
    problems and I am not a fan of hers, though she has got many of the basic things
    right. She, however, has been consistently critical of the established left parties
    in India from the early days of her public career, as can be seen as her attacks
    on the CPI(M) in Kerala and its ambiguous stand on caste issues —
    amongst others which caused EMS to write that whining reply in Frontline to her
    criticisms.   5)\tI don't think it makes sense to
    include politicians here, since they will have to make numerous compromises to
    stay in or acquire power. Social activists, and other public figures who want
    to make an intervention aren't subject to the same constraints
    and so shouldn't feel bound by the same pressures. In anycase,
    the mid-80s was still a time when Congress was riding high and at the central
    level and northern India I remember to say or oppose the Congress almost made
    you a pariah in most establishment circles; hence the need to critique was all
    the more and the dangers to Congress power to being subject to such internal criticism
    was much less. None of this was forthcoming from AB of course at the time. I don't
    expect actors or actresses to set any benchmarks or being incredibility consistent
    in this regard but I would expect them to maybe take some strong stands on issues
    affecting their country domestically and on huge foreign policy issues (Tibet
    unfortunately simply isn't such an issue for India). I would
    say, class and communal polarisation along with the environment are pretty key
    issues for India and Indians, if you can't take a stand on
    these to some extent, then that is pretty poor imo.  6)\tHollywood celebs
    — at least the liberal ones are a lot more engaged than you
    think and more organised. Even from the 80s onwards there was a backlash against
    Reagonomics and his foreign policy -  Michael Douglas and Elizebeth Montgomery
    amongst others set up the &ldquo;Committee for Concern&rdquo;
    a Hollywood pressure group that organised public marches and meeting to protest
    against US policy in Central America. Sarandon, Christopher Reeve, Alec Baldwin
    — who were all rising stars at the time and not well secure
    in their careers founded the Creative Coalition which set out to raise the profile
    of a diverse range of issues like foreign policy, access to the poor to education
    and campaign finance reform. The Hollywood Women's Political
    Committee (HWPC) organised people from across the industry to make protests linked
    to US policy in the Americas, Bob Foxworth and Liz Montgomery organised a meet
    between Daniel Ortega and hundreds of Hollywood figures at their private residence
    which also was given to fund raising for those affected by the Nicaraguan conflict.
    Martin Sheen has been arrested 60 times, that 60 TIMES in protests over the rights
    of illegal immigrants and has spearheaded Project Abolition attacking Bush Jr.'s
    ballistic missile defence programme. Danny Glover came out after the WTC attacks
    — didn't even wait for the build-up to Iraq
    2003, to attack US foreign policy as a major problem in driving conflict against
    stability. Jessica Lange used the lifetime award given to her at the San Sebastian
    Film Festival to attack Bush's admin and entire policy regime
    a speech she made 15 times; Sheen heavily criticised Bush in op-ed pieces and
    turn up to one protest with a cross strapped to his back and his mouth taped to
    indicate how NBC the sponsors of his vehicle The West Wing, were attempting to
    get him to water down attacks on the President. When Cesar-Chavez went on his
    hunger strike for migrant workers rights, a whole range of figures like Lou Diamond
    Phillips, Dos almos and Sheen came out to support him. Glover and Robbins took
    part in organising camps before the Seattle demos, before taking part in the demos
    themselves. While actors like Penn, have made the effort to go into black neighbourhoods
    to campaign for candidates like Nader. Now a lot of these efforts are partial
    and problematic but I think they are an impressive response, especially since
    there is the explicit linkage with anti-capitalism and US policy both abroad and
    home. In a place like the US that is a pretty gutsy thing to do. Israel is as
    you say, the one blind spot and there is a lot of ambiguity here; but this is
    a specific and generic problem with the US and to a lesser degree with Europe
    where Zionism is still seen in many quarters as a progressive cause for Liberals
    and leftists. But I don't think this activism is that 'safe'
    at all; it probably doesn't endanger one physically but it
    does mark you out strongly.  7)\tYes, it is harder to make such stands in
    India but hardly impossible. Figures like Vijay Tendulkar have managed to do so,
    in the heartland of a movement like the Shiv Sena, which really is thuggish and
    violent so I am sceptical as to how much real danger there really is. And AB's
    house got smashed by Raj Thackeray, well cry me a river matey, maybe next time
    he invites the uncle Bal Thackeray to one of his social does, he can complain
    about the nephew.   I haven't seen Dev either and don't
    have that one, so will add it to the list. To be honest, most of what I saw when
    I was in India last were the comedies; which were mostly harmless and brainless
    fun; except perhaps for the stereotyped gender roles they had for women. Still
    going to blame you when they disappoint though."

  content: On the BSP/SP - yes  of course anybody who is a progressive in a real sense
    will be favourably inclined towards these parties; not because of what they do
    or their leadership and even their policies but because of their social constituencies
    and who they represent. They are the symbols and the vehicles on which most of
    the marginalised and oppressed  have projected their desires on and they do represent
    the only effective challenge to date to the established conservative Hindu social
    and religious order in large parts of northern India. They have their own major
    problems which include their own casteism, unprinciplied lust for power, shortsighted
    leadership and willingness to compromise with ideologial enemies but there is
    potential for something more that is encapsulated within the hopes of those who
    form their supporters that has emancipatory promise imo. The main problem here
    is, of course, the Backward-Dalit divide which is a separate topic.

  content: "Good responses here, except for \"Still going to blame you when they disappoint
    though.\" :-)  I mean, try and watch these with an open mind buddy (I say this
    given your earlier statement about Kashyap and how you haven't seen anything that
    would lead you to believe he's capable of a strong critique -- when you seem to
    have seen Hanuman returns (!) but not Black Friday!; personally I don't know if
    Kashyap is capable of great coherence, but given the number of films he's had
    banned or run into trouble (counting Gulaal, that's 3 or 4), he is hardly an establishment
    figure in any sense.  [This holds even when he makes love stories; the recent
    \"Dev D\" was not a very good film IMO, but it was relentlessly calculated to
    offend the SRK/love story sort of sensibility].  You've converted me on
    Hollywood.  I will add that if you are adducing these examples, then we should
    also have to include examples of more local activisms in Bollywood too: Irfan
    Khan's advocacy on the disappearing mangrove cover situation in Mumbai/nexus with
    corrupt builders; Nana Patekar, a Shiv Sainik but someone whose strong advocacy
    on behalf of Mumbai mill workers is very welcome; or Priyadarshan's (the director
    of recent imbecilic comedy infamy)* activism on behalf of silk weavers (I believe
    this even led to a recent, utterly commerically unviable, film on the subject).
    \ None of these efforts have garnered major media coverage (which speaks volumes
    about the sort of media that's there, and the sort of consuming public that's
    there), and I don't suggest this sort of thing is \"enough\", merely that it is
    easy to miss these things if one has washed one's hands off the state of affairs
    entirely.  *[Man, I really detest those comedies.  Although, one of the
    recent ones, the excrescential \"Hey Baby\", features the sort of \"unmarked\"
    Muslim character I was referring to earlier (Fardeen Khan's \"Ali\").  Some other
    recent ones include Jimmy Shergill's character in \"Munnabhai MBBS\"; Gul Panang's
    character in \"Dor\"; Shreyas Talpade's character in \"Iqbal\", and a host of
    character/side-roles.  (It's the relatively \"unmarked\" nature of these characters
    that interests me, given the relative lack of history of this sort of thing; of
    course, if we are talking about the marked-but-\"positive\" representations of
    the sort you were referring to, there too there has been a definite resurgence
    in recent times, from Atul Kulkarni in \"Khakee\" to (sort of) Kunal Kapoor in
    \"Rang de Basanti\" (although he is saddled with a fanatical father in Om Puri;
    to be fair the film also features a caricatured Sangh Parivari in Atul Kulkarni)
    to Akshay Kumar as \"Insaan\" (as a fan of Amar Akbar Anthony, I have a great
    weakness for his lovable turn as Amjad Rickshawalla, and his horny burkha-wearing
    love interest Esha Deol's character here) and several others.  Definitely a huge
    improvement from the nineties/Gadar-era stuff, but of course the merest first
    steps.]"

    of Muslims in the contemporary film industry as compared to previously;  I'm not
    talking about the superstar-actors here per se, but the increasing numbers of
    script-writers, directors/filmmakers, etc. which is I think the more relevant
    metric here (although, one should never dismiss the symbolic potency and \"normalizing\"
    power of the superstar-actor imagery, i.e. of people utterly comfortable in the
    \"Khan\" skin today (as opposed to 50 years ago; perversely, even the \"Muslim-as-underworld-bhai\"

    frail, old, Muslim\" representations -- given the link between representations
    of criminality and glamor; more specifically (following Arendt) the bourgeois'
    secret and not-so-secret fantasies about criminality)...  Speaking of criminality,

    these with an open mind buddy</i>  ROTFLMAO, ok, lemme replace the 'when'
    with an 'if' — that sound
    fairer to you?  The only reason why I saw Hanuman Returns is because I have
    some young kids as nephews/nieces so it was good to watch it with them and because
    I love animation films and Hindu mythological epics, I loved watching the Krishna
    animated films as well. Am a sucker for this stuff!  As for Hollywood, I
    would add though that the main problem is that although these actors/resses and
    many directors and producers are progressive; they still operate within a studio
    system that by large is relatively conservative and is wired into the logic of
    the market and doesn't take many risks. Also I have honed in
    on the activist figures; most are quite liberal but are too self-indulgent or
    pampered to do anything much about it, especially if activisim involves any level
    of discomfort which it does. The other main problem is that Israel and support
    for Israel by the US is a huge black hole.  Comedies: I was thinking more
    along the lines of Aaja Nachle, Phir Hera Phiri, Maine Pyaar Kyon Kiya, Ladies
    Tailor, No Entry, Salaaa-I-Ishq, Mujse Shaadi Karogi etc. Light entertainment
    I know, I know, but I am an avid consumer of trash low brow stuff as long as it
    isn't bigoted. Course the eye candy on offer doesn't
    hurt either.  <i>as a fan of Amar Akbar Anthony</i>  Okay, man that
    is too cheesy even for me; you will need to see a pir, sadhu or some other holy
    man for that; even I can't save you if you like this saccharine
    fare :D  Re Muslims in the industry, that is interesting, I don't
    know enough to say much. I really liked Vikram Chandra's &ldquo;Red
    Earth, Pouring Rain&rdquo; which I would highly recommend if you haven't
    already read it. I haven't read Sacred Games, it got some mixed
    reviews here, haven't read Maximum City either which everyone
    raves about — Mehta annoyed me with some of his interviews
    he gave after the Mumbai attacks but I should read the book before I make up my
    mind."

  content: "Phir hera phiri is kind of like the Adam Sandler films or Rob Schneider;
    absolutely no pretensions about what they are and revel in their crassness; you
    can't take them too seriously. Actually one of my friends loved the film and dragged
    me to see it at the cinema. It was ok.  I liked Maine Pyar and Mujshe Shaadi
    and also Saathiya; mainly cos they were light and the songs were good. The gender
    roles are problematic and if you look at it from a critical perspective quite
    conservative. There is also a steady underlying drumbeat of religiousity that
    runs through many of the films which serve to prop-up an 'everyday common-sense'
    of traditional upper caste Hinduism as well; through the ritual roles allocated
    for the family, the expectations involved according to ones' age and gender and
    the repetitive use of various rituals and temple visits as plot devices. I find
    this a bit troubling and irritating tbh.   AAA is just incredibly dated
    and really takes itself a little too seriously for its own good. Though by now
    my dislike of AB has probably ruined any capacity to enjoy a film where he is
    the lead actor.   <i>Qayamat se Qayamat tak was IMO the best of the teenybopper
    love stories post-Bobby</i>   There are 101 reasons to detest that film;
    I think I had to leave the room everytime my sister and friends wanted to watch
    it because apparently they couldn't put up with my sarky comments. All I can say
    is that this film has left me deeply traumatised.  Bobby was the kind of
    film that appealed to my parents' generation along with Julie when they thought
    they were being daring and progressive. I find it cute for this reason and the
    music is ok but otherwise not much here really.  BTW did you see Omkara,
    for some inane reason I got pressured into seeing some other film and missed this."

  content: 'Saathiya is an authorized remake of Mani Rathnam''s Alai Payuthey, which,
    even though it is basically the same at a scene-to-scene level, is just way better
    (Madhavan, one of the most gifted actors of his generation IMO, plays the male
    lead; although I would prefer Rani Mukherjee to Shalini any day).  The music is
    also mostly the same, but to my non-Tamil ear it mostly sounds better in the Tamil
    original (except for the song Chori pe Chori, which I find just as enjoyable;
    the point is moot because Shaad Ali (who was Rathnam''s assistant on the Tamil
    film) left most of it out in the Hindi film)...  But Alai Payuthey/Saathiya were
    a lot less problematic than the other love stories.  The only way I can express
    it is by saying that Rathnam REPRESENTS a middle class milieu, but doesn''t hold
    it up as some kind of "ideal", the way for instance a Barjatya does in Main Ne
    Pyar Kiya, Vivaah, etc.  (In general, of course, Rathnam is among the more interesting
    commercial film directors on women; politically, his rather dim interventions
    like Roja and Bombay were compensated by the superb, chaotic, disturbing, and
    utterly memorable Dil Se.  Aside: this is the only commercial Hindi film I can
    think of to depict Indian army personnel sexually assaulting a girl in a militancy-hit
    area.  In recent times more than one film has shown massacres and brutality ("Mission
    Kashmir"; "Yahaan"), but not rape; and the massacres are generally presented as
    mistakes (certainly this is so in "Mission Kashmir"; although the film has one
    of the most compelling portrayals of the "good"/nationalist Muslim in Sanjay Dutt''s
    Inayat Khan)).'

  content: PS-- if there's anyone reading this thread who has NOT seen Dil Se, I highly
    recommend it.  For me, the most interesting thing about this film is how it moves
    from the "periphery" to the "center", beginning in a vaguely "North-eastern" locale,
    then what is clearly Ladakh, and finally in Delhi.  Rathnam, that is to say, brings
    the violence, the ambiguity, "home" to the heart of the republic as it were, de-stabilizing
    the normalcy of the recognizable metro as it were (culminating in the "normal"
    Hindu middle-class journalist at the receiving end of police interrogators).  It
    is a dark film, that offers no solution and no exit.  Really remarkable that the
    man who made Roja and Bombay should have come up with something that is so very
    interesting (those two films were fairly bashed by the academic left; but sadly
    Dil Se was utterly ignored -- it's always been a pet peeve of mine that so many
    progressives in the Indian academy are so indifferent or un-informed when it comes
    to popular cinema; they only engage with the latter as a symptom of a certain
    sort of politics, and thus only engage with it at the level of citing "test cases"/exhibits
    in support of an argument.  It's valuable work in its own right, but reductive)...

    there is an attempted rape scene in \"Tango Charlie\", the attempt is unsuccesful
    and it is a Naxalite female guerilla who is the victim but it is set in the Naxalite
    affected parts of Andhra Pradesh. Of course the hero stops the rape attempt and
    kills his colleague to keep the honour of the security forces 'intact' so you
    could say this isn't necessarily an accurate portrayal of what reality is. this
    film while quite jingoistic and lop-sided in its class-sympathies is interesting
    as well in that the mentor figure to Bobby Deol's figure is a Muslim sargeant
    in the BSF who is bascially the perfect solider. IT will be hard to find any movie
    that will contain any kind of criticism of the Indian army and any criticisms
    will be contextualised as reactions to provocations or 'mistakes'. We haven't
    reached the stage where a cinema audience will be able to react without getting
    worked up to such portrayals. Ironic how the the police, civil service, politicians
    and every other branch of the state doesn't suffer from the same problem but then
    most people see regularly just what these parts of the state are really like.   I
    haven't seen Dil Se, heard good things about it but was put off when I read an
    article that used the death scene to try and bascially portray terrorism and suicide
    bombing as a form of romantic irrationalism; which I think is but of a cop out
    from a middle-class perspective that endorses state violence. Still will check
    it out.  Thanks for the Satyam site, looks great."

  content: '"Romantic irrationalism" as far as I am concerned has no meaning in the
    universe of Dil Se.  Rathnam does arguably attempt a sort of "romantic" schema
    (pre-figured in the lyrics and video imagery of the "Satrangi" song) via the Sufi
    "seven stages of ishq" bit, but that is certainly not the dominant reading, and
    doesn''t even sit very easily on the other strands that "happen" in the film.  The
    real center of this film is the character of Manisha Koirala, and rather than
    say that she is "irrational" I would say rather that the film makes no attempt
    to "justify" or "explain" why she is doing what she is doing (even her childhood
    rape by Indian soldiers is a catastrophic cruelty inflicted upon her, I do not
    see the film as presenting that as an "explanation" for her actions as an adult)
    -- if anything, by film''s end it is the "normal" Amar (SRK) whose rationality
    is called into question (aside: there is an overt parallel drawn between the soldiers
    forcing themselves onto Koirala-the-child and Amat forcing a kiss on the adult
    Koirala): there is simply no language he and she seem to share, nothing that might
    enable the sort of "persuasion" he pathetically, like the good hero, holds on
    to till almost the very end.'

    in the Hyderabadi Urdu dialect that have been produced over the last 4-5 years?
    \ If not, check 'em out: they are Z-grade films with pathetic production values,
    but I crack up listening to the dialog (these films, made by and featuring Hyderabadis
    for the most part, rely on the dialect as essentially their only comedic mechanism).
    \ \"The Angrez\" is the first and the most famous, although my own favorite is
    \"Hyderabad Nawabs\".  [Um, don't watch these with your kids; you might not want
    to explain some of the dialogs; also, a couple of my Pakistani and North Indian
    friends needed subtitles on a few occasions]."

  content: "Ok, that makes more sense, I just didn't want to be going to see another
    Roja-type propaganda movie about how nasty terrorists are and how we are all poor
    victimes and shouldn't try to understand them at all. Dil Se looks a bit more
    interesting off the back of your description there.  I didn't know that
    about Nandana Sen - Wow! I haven't seen Mangal Pandey yet  - I know, I know gimme
    a break though I spend lots of times in villages with no access to movies! but
    that sounds like an intelligent film there by Khan.  After having wasted
    hours on the likes of Tango Charlie and Phir Hera Pheri, you're
    in no position to complain :-)    Easy there tiger! Tango Charlie I saw
    in a rundown guest house where they had nothing else on cable at night; though
    it also allowed me to see Umrao Jaan, so I shouldn't complain. and Phir hera phiri
    was a birthday treat for a friend and was the first time I had been to see a Hindi
    film at the cinema for years so I enjoyed it! Cut me some slack here!  I
    didn't even know about that Hyderabadi cinema, hate low production values but
    will check one out if I get the chance. BTW have you seen this film from the early
    80's \"Talaq, Talaq, Talaq\" I remember it from when I was a kid. Again a rare
    example of a film with Muslim leads, more so in this case because it is a sort
    of romantic love story. Whole thing is one youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRTL6IAuyZw"

  content: "Re: \"Again a rare example of a film with Muslim leads, more so in this
    case because it is a sort of romantic love story.\"  BTW, there were others
    of this ilk during the 1980s: for instance, Nikaah (for god's sake don't watch
    this if you haven't), but (far more enjoyably); Tawaif (the milieu is a highly
    idealized and improbable Urdu-enclave in the middle of Bombay, but both Rishi
    Kapoor and Rati Agnihotri are in sparkling form here); and of course the biggest
    one of them all, Amitabh's 1983 Coolie (I know you hate this guy, but no discussion
    of representations of \"the Muslim\" -- or more broadly, the \"minority\" -- in
    Hindi cinema is possible without discussions of his Anthony, or Coolie's Iqbal,
    or his 786-wearing Vijay in Deewar with a quarrel with God; actually his billa
    number is 786 in Coolie as well); later on there is the appallingly bad Sanam
    Bewafa (a huge Salman Khan hit in 1990 or 1991; set in some Pathan neverland).  In
    recent years, Muslim leads have tended to happen in films that in one way or another
    concern terrorism/militantcy, so I haven't bothered listing any of those.  Delhi-6
    is a very useful corrective in many ways.  Actually, speaking of Abhishek Bachchan,
    his first film Refugee featured a fascinatingly \"liminal\" lead character in
    the first half of the film: a man who is known only as \"refugee\", who repeatedly
    crosses the border between India and Pakistan and literally inhabits the \"in
    between\" space, and whose religious affiliation is unclear.  [Unfortunately,
    J.P. Dutta lost his marbles in the second half and forced his \"Refugee\" to pick
    sides; he ends up in an Indian army uniform -- leaving aside any ideological/political
    issue, this was implausible in the extreme given the film's characterization of
    the character up to that point.  As an aside, the film features Suniel Shetty
    as a fairly positive Pakistani armyman.  Speaking of armymen, and somewhat off-topic,
    Farah Khan's superhit Main Hoon Na featured a glamorous Pakistani general who's
    a great guy; the Indian armymen are also great guys, but the baddies are renegade
    Indian army-men who want to destroy the Indo-Pak peace process (they were disciplined
    by the army and disgraced after they killed villagers in a border area in cold
    blood); one can (depressingly) detect the love/hate admiration of the bourgeoisie
    for the figure of Musharraf in the film's  uncritical valorization of the Pakistan
    (the same sort of \"He's a straight talker\", \"He's tough!\", \"Say what you
    will, he's a real leader\" crap that on its day easily translates to love for
    all sorts of authoritarians, like Modi and his ilk).]"

    love a man in uniform that can promise he will \"make the trains run on time\"

<p>DK sent me a song from this promising new film, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS7KLVs1Ib4">Gulaal</a> and it occurred to me how fragile the rationale of PK is. Imagine such a commercial movie (if you can imagine a commercial movie made in PK) that takes as its premise an out-right revolt against the state. Could the Baluchi nationalists project their narrative through celluloid? It isn't the fact of creativity (I have read some amazing poetry recently on the Baluchi cause that I can share if peeps are interested) but that the state/capital apparatus can make space for such imaginations within the public realm (this despite/due to the facts of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/weekinreview/01pepper.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Chhattisgarh</a>). Of course, I haven't seen the movie and it may ultimately be reactionary and (as is the norm regarding "Muslim" themes in Bollywood) confirm and conform the very inequalities of the State. But, I still, you know, just _wish_ for a big popcorn movie that would put out, for the world to see, this threadbare fabric, we call Pakistan. </p>
<p>But, maybe we cannot imagine that ever. Seeing as how Zardari is doing his best <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/world/asia/15pstan.html?hp">Musharraf</a> impression, such a fantasy would threaten reality.</p>
<p>ps. the twitter-verse tells that cell-phone providers are under fire from Zardari as well.<br />
pps. The songs from Gulaal really are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m3kFWU_es4">amazing</a>!</p>
