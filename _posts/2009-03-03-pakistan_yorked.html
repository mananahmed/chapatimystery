  content: "I am posting a few comments from my own blog because I think they are
    still relevant:\r\nThe terrorists are still at large in Lahore. This is really
    bad news.\r\n\r\n1. If Islamist terrorists are involved (and they are the prime
    suspects) then this does represent a new escalation. It means they are willing
    to attack any and all pakistani targets and symbols, which is really bad news...After
    all, the army trained tens of thousands of these people and if even a few fringe
    groups are now willing to go this far, then the mayhem to come will be terrible.
    Some people are already blaming RAW (that nut hamid gul has already blamed India
    for the attack), but my guess is that even if another power paid for the action,
    they probably used islamist terrorists to do the actual job. Its not that no one
    in Indian \"intelligence\" would want to do this (some surely would, as revenge
    for Mumbai and so on), but even if some crazy person wants to do this, who will
    he use to do the actual fighting? This was professionally done, and when you want
    really professional terrorists, you hire the best.....Other than the LTTE, that
    can only mean Islamist terrorists. And the LTTE has its hands full right now,
    but i guess they can still be regarded as the secondary suspects.\r\n2. The security
    failure is glaring...especially the fact that after such a high profile attack,
    the attackers seem to have escaped (at least till now).\r\n3. The only silver
    lining is that the elite force fought them off and stood their ground. This is
    not surprising to me...I do think the punjab police is still capable of standing
    up to terrorists, but just barely. If Zardari and company have their way, this
    wont be the case a few years down the road. At a certain level of corruption and
    opportunism, you can no longer count on the soldiers to stand and fight...\r\nIn
    response to the claim that this is a false flag operation:\r\n1.Very very few
    serious terrorist operations have turned out to be \"false flag operations\".
    If you look at the list of false flag operations on wikipedia, you will see that
    even advanced countries generally manage very simple things (like setting a bomb
    or burning down a building) and it doesnt take too long to figure out who was
    responsible. The fact is, the existence of a few false flag operations has given
    the terrorists and their sympathizers the ability to claim EVERY terrorist outrage
    as a false flag operation. This is just not credible.\r\n2. Even when false flag
    operations really exist, the state has responsibilities and abilities that need
    to be discussed. Whoever did this, why would they get away? What makes muslims
    the target of every conspiracy, but unable to conspire back against anyone? If
    RAW did this (and I am not saying they had no hand in it, we just dont know yet)
    then the question of how 12 Indian commandos could live in lahore, rent guest
    houses, launch attacks, and then disappear, still has to be answered.\r\n3. Conspiracy
    mongering exists in all populations, but has reached critical levels in the muslim
    world (for whatever reasons).The only conspiracy theory I regard as credible is
    this one: Mossad has set up a special cell to spread conspiracy theories in the
    muslim world. This conspiracy has succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. The entire
    muslim world spends its time chasing imaginary targets and living further and
    further away from reality, thus making Israel's job that much easier.\r\n4. It
    is NOT correct to immediately say \"who benefits\" and assume that whoever benefits
    must have done it. Who benefited from world war two? In the end, it was Russia
    and America. Who got destroyed completely? Germany. Yet there is absolutely no
    evidence that Russia or America wanted the war or started the war. Germany started
    the war and somebody else benefited. That kind of miscalculation happens all the
    time.\r\nin response to \"why doesnt the ICC boycott India and Sri Lanka\":\r\nYou
    are being unfair here. Terrorists in Sri Lanka never attacked cricketers and were
    always extremely disciplined, so it was always clear that if their leaders say
    they wont attack cricketers, they wont do it. The reason some teams refused to
    go to Sri Lanka was due to the fear that players may be randomly caught in some
    bombing or attack and Pakistan agreed to go. But this situation is different:
    these terrrorists have absolutely no limits to what they will do and they do not
    seem to be in anyone's total control. Naturally, there is more fear connected
    with going to pakistan.\r\nIndia is a target of the same terrorists but India's
    security services (even though they are clearly rickety and less than competent)
    are unambiguously aligned against the terrorists and there is some element of
    \"lets not give in to the terrorists\"...having said that, I think some western
    teams may in the future refuse to go to India as well because these terrrorists
    can and will attack foreigners in India as well.\r\nPakistan is especially in
    trouble because first of all the terrorists are based IN pakistan. Secondly, the
    pakistani security forces are even now not clearly aligned against the terrorists.
    Thirdly, since pakistan officially created these terrorists, there is less sympathy
    for the pakistani position internationally."

    is the key quote. The goal of these terrorists are not to fight the government
    but to civil pakistani society. This is a total war strategy. The question is,
    what is pakistan going to do about it? is zardari capable or will it take another
    military dictatorship to take on this challenge?"

  content: "The following discussion was in reference to the less than heroic police
    response to the attack ....as details have come in, it has become clear that neither
    the elite force, nor any other police unit, did anything worthwhile during or
    after the attack. It was the bus driver who managed to get the team away....\r\nSo
    this brings up the question of what to expect in the future? I have spoken to
    some punjab police people and have some random thoughts of my own:\r\n1. The baseline
    corruption and inefficiency of subcontinental police forces is a given, but while
    that is a serious problem, it is not a fatal one.  That inefficient and corrupt
    force may not be able to act like some high tech SWAT team (and high tech SWAT
    teams rarely do as well as they are portrayed in movies anyway), but after the
    fact, they are not that bad at catching people when the high command and their
    political masters are totally clear that X or Y HAS to be caught. The high profile
    criminals who manage to stay uncaught are the ones who have corrupt contacts and
    protectors at high levels. Otherwise, the bureaucracy may be slow and inefficient,
    but its tentacles go everywhere and its crude methods are still more than a match
    for any free lance adventurers.\r\n2. But this corrupt force is not going to put
    its lives on the line when someone else has ultimate responsibility and someone
    else (more powerful than them) may have another agenda. This is what musharrfocracy
    (and army rule in general) has wrought. It has completely mangled the lines of
    responsibility and made it easy for people (who are not too heroic to begin with)
    to say: the \"real powers\" probably want something else or may betray us to the
    very criminals we are being asked to catch, let them deal with the mess. I really
    dont want to die that soon\".\r\n3. What I hear from the police (and this may
    be self serving exagerration) is: \"we know who is responsible. We can catch them.
    But who knows what the real game is? why should i catch them and have my picture
    on GEO so that they and their friends in the \"agencies\" can get me shot tomorrow\"?\r\n4.
    I have heard from leftists that the exploited lower class soldiers will just not
    fight for the upper class to live their parasitic life in Defence. Maybe some
    truth in that. But I think the left tends to exagerrate how much \"class consciousness\"
    operates in these things. The fact is, if the officers are relatively fair to
    their men and have some ability to command, they can get them to fight for them.
    But officers like that are going to become rarer and rarer with every round of
    horse trading.\r\n5. Ideally, the army should have held a fair election, allowed
    a reasonable judiciary and let the power of legitimate democracy do some work.
    But that would have involved ceding some authority to the people and the corrupt
    and highly parasitic establishment was not willing to share ANYTHING or loose
    ANY privileges, even if it meant taking the country down with them (well, they
    hope to be in dubai before the last helicopter takes off from the embassy). For
    whatever short sighted reasons, the US embassy either did not want that either,
    or did not want to upset the army (which they may regard as the only force capable
    of doing the job). So the higher judiciary was destroyed to protect the privileges
    of the ruling establishment (and not just the NRO). The positive momentum generated
    by the elections was successfully dissipated by \"leaders\" like Zardari. and
    here we are, back at square one. \r\nOnly a popular govt with SOME real legitimacy
    can get millions of people to do millions of everyday small things that will turn
    the place around. This is not a black or white issue. LOTS of grey can be tolerated,
    but there IS a limit. Rahman Malik and Zardari are not on the correct side of
    that limit. Some Pakistanis are saying new army rule will be able to set things
    right. But that implies that the army has the ability to run things and is willing
    to build up institutions that will eventually challenge its authority. What is
    the evidence for that?...What is different about Kiyani sahib? And we dont even
    know if the army high command has managed to rid itself of its jihadi faction?\r\n6.
    It may well be that the point of no return has already been crossed. But I dont
    see how that can be casually accepted as the end of the matter. 170 million people
    are facing the prospect of violence worse than the first terrible partition and
    of living under the Islamic Khmer Rouge, I dont think they are all ready for it
    yet.\r\nRestoration of the popularly elected govt in Punjab would be a good first
    step, but only the first tiny step. Without a turnaround in legitimacy at the
    center, the downward spiral will continue...."
