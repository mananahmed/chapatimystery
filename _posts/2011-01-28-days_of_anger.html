  content: "The myth that this is a phenomenon triggered by wikileaks, facebook and
    twitter has already been debunked since the beginning of the upheaval in Tunisia.
    You're correct in saying that these countries have their individual histories
    and this an organic consequence of decades of disenfranchisement.   Are
    you rejecting the notion that this is part of a \"wave of upheaval\",  so to speak?
    Is it not entirely plausible that the Tunisian upheaval helped to legitimize and
    demystify revolution/upheaval/civil disobedience for the \"Arab World\"?  There
    have been quiet struggles throughout the histories of these nations, and some
    not-so-quiet ones as well. But do you think it's just a coincidence that one Arab
    nation initiates upheaval, and then mass protests start taking place in other
    Arab nations?   Just want to clarify if you are denying that the Tunisian
    upheaval didn't act as a trigger. The ammunition was already present (as you have
    stated) but it seems hard to deny that Tunisia wasn't a trigger.   Do share
    your thoughts and elaborate. Thanks."

  content: 'SM: Yes, Tunisian upheaval acted as a trigger in some sense, but so did
    the "election" which took place in Egypt merely a month ago. Or maybe the attacks
    on the Copts. The point, as I noted above in the footnote, is that these actualities
    get subsumed when one asserts the transmission hypothesis.'

  content: "Sorry man, but I'm going to have to disagree here. While Lebanon has little
    in common with Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen, that's mostly because its system of governance
    is radically different.   On the other hand, it's hard to overstate the
    electrified atmosphere (shared throughout the Arab world) that started with Tunisia
    and is now continuing in Egypt.  The telephone effect you mention is definitely
    important, but just as important is the amplifying effect of Jazeera, youtube
    and facebook. So while it's clear that all of these countries have very different
    histories and   local situations, to say that there isn't a regional momentum
    seems wrong to me.  While pan-Arabism may be at a low-point, never to return
    to the heady days of Nasser, pan-Arab media is at an all-time high, and that is
    what helps connect Tunis, Cairo, Sana'a and  Amman."

  content: Sean, What you describe - the electrified atmosphere, the pan-Arab media
    - as commonalities, I tend to see as after-effects and amplifiers (regional momentum
    might be too strong for me). The cause, the anger, the pain is local, deeply local,
    and historically distinctive. That is merely my point. So, I am not denying those
    connections, I am asserting against the NYT/Internets "narrative"

    to be written with greater local nuance then it is at the moment.   I just
    think that stating it is not a domino effect can only be applied to the culture
    or political realities of the \"cause\" of the upheaval. It is a domino effect
    in the manner of activism and a collective momentum garnered and borne from the
    Tunisian upheaval.   Stating that it is not a domino effect, across the
    board, unfairly disconnects the momentum created by the Tunisians."

  content: "But this is such a deep impulse for those of us trained in area studies
    traditions, to insist on the primacy of locality for understanding all events.
    I think that's partly because this is generally \"true\": all events have local,
    particular dimensions of causality and feeling that are easily obscured by large-scale
    generalizations, monocausal readings, and so on, and are not appreciated by people
    who don't know places the way we know places.  At the same time, it's a
    reading we're always ready to give because it favors our own expertise and disfavors
    many other forms of expertise or authority. The tricky thing in this case is what
    are we to do about actors <em>within</em> local contexts who themselves insist
    that what they're doing is connected to or inspired by action elsewhere? Because
    they surely exist in this case, much as they have in some other episodes of events
    in disparate nations or locations that mass media have seen as connected. There's
    some fairly dizzying chicken-and-egg stuff embedded in this problem."

  content: "Agree with SM and Missanlu. Sepoy, the grievances may be local but the
    individual and collective decision to act on those grievances is, in all likelihood,
    a product of regional effects. If what you're saying is true, then we would *never*
    see contagion or demonstration effects at work, because there's *always* local
    grievances at play.   The timing of the Egypt uprising would have to be
    awfully big coincidence to take place now, if we are to assume the blank-slate
    regional effects you're forwarding here. From nationalist/freedom movements in
    the colonial world to democratization movements in 1980s Latin America and Southern
    Europe, big changes in one place after often (not always) accompanied by big changes
    in other places. That's not a coincidence."

  content: "There are also more solid and immediate provocations for the current uprisings
    in Tunisia and Egypt. There has again been an increase in food prices (and more
    generally, a worsening economic situation, see the links by no above for example).
    Food price fluctuations have the potential to topple governments and there were
    food riots in Egypt two years ago as well. Like the author of the blog, I am also
    skeptical of the role that the internet has played in these uprisings. Personally,
    I think they are subsidiary in the local context, but certainly have a role in
    emphasizing what is happening in these countries in the international media. They
    also make for convenient and cute narratives for what are essentially complicated
    causes.   Also, I wonder what the real extent of internet coverage is in
    these countries? I doubt that it is so extensive that most people have access
    to information through it."

  content: "In every country where modern education and economics has made forays,
    the population wants some say in what goes on and economics demands some rationality
    in governance. The elite always has more influence than the poor, but even within
    the elite, there are notions of rule of law, political space, personal space,
    opportunity to move forward and so on. And the poor must have the means for bare
    survival and at least a vague notion that they can move forward on merit if they
    are really really good. Historical contingencies and other local factors make
    every case different and culture DOES matter, but its still possible to make some
    generalizations. One is that bull#### like the Mubarak dynasty is not going to
    last. Another is that extreme forms of Islamism are not going to make most people
    happy even if war with outsiders is not an issue. Another is that if you hook
    the elite on selling their role as \"bulwark against Islamism\", you will face
    accelerating demands for more money, you will foster terrible corruption and you
    will strengthen support for those very Islamists. In fact, it is an indication
    of the Islamists profoundly outdated and unproductive philosophical framework
    that they cannot take more advantage of this wonderful opportunity presented to
    them courtesy of the US taxpayer. US policymakers who act as if the US has
    to determine what happens everywhere and simultaneously believe that there is
    very little the US can do to change things for the better, are wrong on both counts.
    In the Middle East, they are laboring under the very real burden that they really
    do want something (Israeli occupation) that almost everyone in that part of the
    world does not support, so their \"democratic\" options are limited. But even
    where the US does not necessarily have such a burden to carry (Pakistan, for example),
    hamhanded interference, reliance on outdated or irrelevant models (like the \"modernizing
    army\", \"the whisky-drinking-moderate-Muslim\", the Latin American model of using
    the army against undesirables at the cost of democracy, and so on) are not exactly
    working. but, no matter, change is coming. With, without or in spite of US
    participation. And Israel should really make a fair peace from a position of strength
    while they have that chance. Its going to become so costly to support that occupation,
    even Uncle Sam may one day be unable to afford to carry that millstone around
    his neck..."

<p>What <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/01/protest_spreads_in_the_middle.html">we see</a> is life itself. These are the millions who have been denied participation in their own lives. Millions who have suffered the oppressive, fanatic violence of a state propped up by vested interests. They were always visible, they were always trying to tell their story, trying to eek out an existence of dignity and honor. How long can that quiet struggle last? How many have to give up before one stands and says, I will not go silently. </p>
<p>These are the days of anger - and they will be noted. Some, who are far away, can do more than bear witness. We can raise our voices in support.</p>
