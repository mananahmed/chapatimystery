  content: "Once I inquired Cowasjee (Dawn Pakistan ), How come Jinnah carved a smaller
    secular country from a big secular India.Cowasjee responded as below   \"He
    did what he could to make a homeland for the Muslims who he feared  would not
    be able to compete with the majority.  Not confused - merely used expediency. Best AC\"  From
    the above nuggget, from 1916 it seems like poor guy(Jinnah) was just trying to
    meet his own need of being liked and admired by a lot of people(now 160 million
    and counting),evrything else in which he plated a role was incidental to it! MA"

  content: This is fascinating. It sort of disturbs me to realize that several of
    his responses are identical or nearly so to those I would have given to those
    questions--even as recently as a few years ago. Monte Cristo is gold.

  content: "Hello, I made a mistake which I must correct. In his reply to the
    second question - \"Stree ma vakhanva layak sadgun kayo?\" (what are the qualities
    a woman should be admired for?) - Jinnah replied \"Vafadari\" (loyalty), and not
    vrudhdhadari, as I had misread. My apologies to Mr Hasan, and his readers."
