  content: "Many many congrats! Let me share a poem with you on this occasion in the
    hope that Pakistan will change for good until you write your next book.  \r\n\r\nThe
    Kakul Syndrome\r\n\r\n(for the silent revolution in Pakistan)\r\n\r\nBy Habib
    Sulemani\r\n\r\nGod Almighty! Generals fake\r\nThey've put country at stake\r\nGenerals
    mean personal gain\r\nThe armed forces're in pain!\r\n\r\nGenerals're bloody fool\r\nTake
    a bath an' be cool!\r\n\r\nMilitary men&acirc;&euro;&trade;re public servants\r\nNot
    masters from the heavens!\r\nBut they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re arrogant an' cruel\r\nDon't
    care for common people\r\n\r\nGenerals're bloody fool\r\nTake a bath an' be cool!\r\n\r\nYou
    own huge firms an' agriland\r\nTurning country into terrorland!\r\nNo-one among
    you bothers at all\r\nWhere the terrified people stand!\r\n\r\nSuffering from
    the Kakul Syndrome\r\nYou're always out&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;even if at home\r\nBy
    providing terrorists sanctuary\r\nYou've failed to protect country\r\n\r\nStill
    you behave like intellectuals\r\nNot men behind petty squabbles!\r\nYou've lost
    every single battle\r\nYet foolishly believe: you rattle!\r\n\r\nGenerals're bloody
    fool\r\nTake a bath an' be cool!\r\n\r\nAfter failure on geographical borders\r\nYou
    champion ideological frontiers\r\nIt's easy to fight on ambiguous front\r\nCos
    you like a lavish bedroom stint!\r\n\r\nUsing a pawn religious leader\r\nOr an
    ISI-paid TV anchor\r\nYou can make storm in teacup\r\nChange system&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;down
    to up!\r\n\r\nThe generals&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve taken refuge\r\nIn ideological
    war an' abuse!\r\nDon't try to fool world anymore!\r\nDon't you see outside an
    uproar?\r\n\r\nGenerals're bloody fool\r\nTake a bath an' be cool!\r\n\r\nSee
    the writing on the wall\r\nOnly you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re sick not we all\r\nThe
    military is vanguard\r\nOf a scary fanatic world!\r\nThe nation wants to know
    your aim\r\nYou've multiplied the double game!\r\n\r\nYou&acirc;&euro;&trade;re
    soldiers or businessmen?\r\nPlaying tricks on the politician!\r\nYou didn't defend
    country borders\r\nWith broken oath, you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re traitors!\r\n\r\nThere
    is no escape from the law\r\nDug earth with your filthy paw!\r\nYou can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    deceive the tax payers\r\nGod has heard people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s prayers!\r\n\r\nYou&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve
    lied to the nation\r\nNot once, again an' again\r\nYou've neither mind nor a soul\r\nAn'
    you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re always playing foul!\r\n\r\nGenerals're bloody fool\r\nTake
    a bath an' be cool!\r\n\r\nIt&acirc;&euro;&trade;s time to take a dose of wisdom!\r\nStop
    violation of our basic freedom\r\nRespect democracy at home\r\nOr face the doom
    an&acirc;&euro;&trade; gloom!"

<p>It has come to this. On or about May 31, 2011 you will be able to purchase <a href="http://www.justworldbooks.com/books/151-where-the-wild-frontiers-are:-pakistan-and-the-american-imagination">Where the Wild Frontiers Are: Pakistan and the American Imagination</a> - a curated, edited collection of my posts from CM and elsewhere. Some fine folks have contributed immense amount of their time and talent to make this happen and I am still a bit unsettled about it. </p>
<p>CM was a space invented for an imaginary audience by a frustrated (and easily distracted) graduate student. From its beginning, it was consciously an "academic blog" and I participated in many forums (online and offline) about the meaning, the mode, the future and past of "academic blogging" [curious folks can look up <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/univercity/ceci_nest_pas_une_blague.html">this</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/univercity/the_polyglot_manifesto_i.html">this</a> as two early examples]. One part of this engagement was my insistence that "blogs" were a publishing venue which democratized a certain aspect of academic speech. Another part of this engagement was my deep unhappiness in the way it handled archives. They vanished - relying solely on the Search box or the vagaries of Google. Back then, Google was good. </p>
<p>Helena Cobban, at Just World Books, had a brilliant idea in producing curated books from blogs covering timely subject-material. Joshua Foust, of Registan, was the one who introduced me to Cobban and she was enthusiastic about the possibility of CM existing as a published archive. After some massive help - the first foray into the archive jungle was done by Farangi and SalmaanH and, put together by Sabrina S. - I was able to put together a somewhat thematic coherence to the book. Another round (or was it two) of editing happened.</p>
<p>My dearest friend and co-blogger Lapata, then contributed her art for the book (and the cover). Amitava Kumar generously agreed to write the foreword (which is humbling!) and some other people who have way more things to do than time to do it in, agreed to blurb it. </p>
<p>You will, certainly, hear a lot more here about the book and I will certainly beg and plead (not now, though) you to buy a copy. It is launching in the US first, but there will be a e-book version and I am keen on getting it published in Pakistan/India (if you know someone who knows someone etc...)</p>
<p>Love and thanks,</p>
<p>Sepoy</p>
