  content: "I guess soon the General will be handing over AQ Khan to his master!  Afterall
    AQ Khan is a greedy, selfish paki (some kinda traitor as Sheikh Rasheed would
    describe) who miraculously transferred nuclear reactors to Iran & Libiya ALONE!!
    clever guy indeed... n poor General has to clean up his mess now ;)"

  content: "I think that people to people contacts are bringing people closer, but
    this process is slow and it will take time before we understand eachother. Meanwhile
    we should talk more about our common passions such as Bollywood, cricket and ecnomic
    boom. These things will lead us to understand eachother but we need a lot more
    than that to solve issues.  While looking for stories of Pakistani players
    in India I came across many Indian newspapers talking alot about Pakistan and
    mostly in negative tone. This contrast of Indian media is very confusing. On the
    one hand they never forget to repeat their famous line \"We are same people divided
    by a line on a peice of paper\"  and then they also never forget to portray Pakistani
    society as evil barbarians ready to take over infidels. Pakistani media also covers
    India in the similar fashion. This thing needs to be change, we should learn to
    trust each other."

    What you're talking about is a good example of some of the stuff that Amitava Kumar covers in his book "Husband of a Fanatic".  It's not a bad read, if in fact you haven't already plowed your way through it.

    As far as that picture goes, I haven't a clue.  I'm assuming that a game of "Truth or Dare" was involved though.

  content: this is unrelated to your post. Are you the person who has a friend in
    Chi-town returning to Toyama City? Is this friend a Japanese female? If it is
    a Japanese female- I think I know her in a friend of a friend way.

  content: Pakistan or India? Imran Khan (he is a superstar to me) or Abhishek Bachchan?
    Lollywood or Bollywood? I'm sorry to waterdown decades of religious and political
    conflict into a contest over lusty South Asian men and cinema. Please forgive
    me but I have to side with Abhishek and Bollywood. I've never seen a Lollywood
    film.

    <b>About the picture of inzi turning medieval:</b>
    LG (or some other consumer electronic manufacturer) in India is running an ad campaign on TV with Ganguly and Inzi dressed in battle gear while wielding oak. *silly*

    <b>About visiting India / Chennai:</b>
    An old friend from Chennai, now in Canada writes about his experiences at getting a visa to Pakistan:

<p><img src="/img/cricfan.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Outlook India has a rather breathless piece, <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20050321&fname=Cover+Story+%28F%29&sid=1&pn=1">When Veer Met Zaara</a>, on  the Pakistani cricket fans visiting India. The Pakistanis are discovering that "'their hated neighbour' is a more developed, easy-going, and less suffocating place" and now, "they don't want to return". To make matters worse, The General has been extended an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4331935.stm">invite</a> to come and see cricket. There is rising concern in Indian administration that The General may not want to return either! After all, his ancestral <a href="http://www.the-south-asian.com/June2001/General_Musharraf's_Haveli.htm">hawaili</a> is still around. And the WoT is really starting to get on his last nerve. And Basmati is about to <a href="http://sify.com/news/international/fullstory.php?id=13690929">visit</a> with more demands. And the only thing <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1217753,0005.htm">AQ Khan</a> <i>not</i> do was make an eBay posting for a <i>DIY Centrifuge for Dictators</i>. Seriously, dude. N. Korea. Iran. Egypt. What? No love for Algeria? or the Saudis who funded the whole enchilada? It is enough to make a dictator yearn for simpler times in Delhi - put-putting around with his lil' dog and his tinkler of Johnny Black.  Ok. I kid. </p>
<p>I do find it amusing that the press on Indians visiting Pakistan last year was exactly the same way. Indians wanted to move to Pakistan. One of these days, we shall have a sober <a href="/archives/homistan/_and_cricket_is_haram_anyways.html">look</a> at the p2p contacts between the two nations. Danial linked to <a href="http://ummat.com.pk/ejaz_mangi.htm">this</a> column by Ejaz Mangi in the <i>Ummat</i>. The column is decrying the influence of Bollywood on Pakistan - seemingly making Ashish Nandy's <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1045327.cms">point</a> about Bollywood uniting/creating South Asia. The argument for or against Bollywood as a cultural krazyglue does not hold much appeal for me. There is no denying that the people of India and Pakistan share a cultural past and a living memory. I am all for open borders for travel and business. I want to go to Delhi, dammit. I want to go to Chennai, too.</p>
<p>I really need to get to work but <b>someone</b> please explain <a href="/img/inzi_chair.jpg" target="blank">this</a>.</p>
