  content: 'I''m actually curious about something in the strictures above: he refers
    to the "ideology of Pakistan" but I''m not aware of any specific national doctrine.....
    What, if anything other than General-worship, is Pakistanianism?'

  content: The ideology of Pakistan is a <a href="http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A129"
    rel="nofollow">time-honored, sacrosanct belief</a> that Pakistan was established
    as a separate homeland for Muslims of India who are historically, culturally,
    and of course religiously separate from the Hindus. Threats against the ideology,
    in the context above, would be things like questioning whether the Partition was
    a good idea or agitating for some sort of union/pan South Asian spirit etc. etc.

    point? How does Pakistan come through this?"

  content: Jonathan Dresner you have described it so well, its exactly that General-worship
    phenomenan. You know it's like a military with a country rather then a country
    with a military. And remember that dictatorship needs extremists and extremists
    needs dictatorship, dictatorshipe needs these fanatic-extremists to justify there
    illegitimate rule and extremist needs dictatorship to prosper as they have never
    prospered in this history of this country as they did in General-Zia and now General
    Musaharraf time. Never in the history of Pakistan the religious parties secured
    more then 5% of the vote in elections (in 1997 general elections only 1 member
    of these religious parties was elected to a 100 member assembly of Frontier Province)
    unless under the kind hand/supervision of dictatorship wherein they were given
    the blessng of forming a government in Frontier Province which is being projected
    as extremly religious and extremist society but one finds the relity when u visit
    and spend some time in that society that these extremist forms hardly 5% of that
    province/society's and are obiously being funded from outside wheras the vast
    majority of that society are moderate and even secular.

  content: Actually, under the classic 'ideology of Pakistan', Muslim fundamentalism
    makes perfect sense - it was actually 'solidified' as an actual term and made
    sacrosanct under Zia ul Haq.  Any agitation against his Islamization programme
    came afoul of this 'ideology of Pakistan'.  Thus it has also always been strategically
    deployed against _secular_ politics, implying (and often directly stating) that
    their secular politics was actually against the ideology of Pakistan because it
    undermined the justification for Partition from India, and so was a 'pro-India'
    move.  This is very different, but the seeds of the 'ideology of Pakistan', and
    hence the state, being collapsed into the head of state was laid very early on
    and made more complete under Zia.

    benefit. Thankyou Mushy for introducing me to the word malafide.\r\n\r\nDuas that
    it's not the end of the world and the people get through to the other side in
    tact. I might check out the london protest to see what kinds of people show up."

<p><b>Jackbooted State</b></p>
<p>If the Watchman had not helped the Dacoit<br />
Today our feet wouldn't be in chains, our victory not defeat<br />
Wrap your turbans around your neck, crawl on your bellies<br />
Once on top, it is hard to bring down, the jackbooted state.</p>
<p>&raquo; The <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20144&Itemid=2">code of conduct</a> for media has finally been issued by the General. Highlights:</p>
<p>The media can </p>
<blockquote><p>
(j) not broadcast video footage of suicide bombers, terrorists, bodies of victims of terrorism, statements and pronouncements of militants and extremist elements and any other act which may, in any way, promote, aid or abet terrorists activities or terrorism;</p>
<p>(k)  ensure that no anchor person, moderator or host propagates any opinion or acts in any manner prejudicial to the ideology of Pakistan or sovereignty, integrity or security of Pakistan.</p>
<p>(l)   not broadcast any programme inciting violence or hatred or any action prejudicial to maintenance of law and order;</p>
<p>(m) not broadcast anything which defames or brings into ridicule the Head of State, or members of the armed forces, or executive, legislative or judicial organs of the state;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, it comes down to a don't-mock-me law. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XEpHV9WGCM">This</a> is probably ok, though. Most of the media is still blacked out. YouTube is also a good place to get random news feeds - such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUSjK7taLUE">these</a> street interviews. </p>
<p>&raquo; They tried to arrest Imran Khan but he, um, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Imran_Khan_escapes_from_house_arrest/articleshow/2517638.cms">escaped</a> ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZDfHGETGU">here is why</a> it was probably a good idea not to get arrested. </p>
