  content: "This is not looking good. Unless we are able to open up the decision making
    and get some adult supervision over the army brass, the army is perfectly capable
    of causing such massive suffering AND achieving nothing (beyond the dollars the
    top brass will get).If this turns out to be yet another cynical ploy by the Pak
    army, then who will be held responsible for this exodus and the deaths and suffering
    associated with it? Liberals who are prematurely ejaculating over this operation
    need to keep the army and its agencies past shenanigans in view. The taliban have
    got to be stopped at the border of the settled areas, and this army is the only
    army we have. But without adult supervision this general staff is capable of disasters
    no civilian can even imagine... about the tribal areas, I think if the tribal
    areas prefer taliban rule, why shouldnt they have it? and then they can handle
    their own foreign relations with NATO and Afghanistan in whatever way they see
    fit. It is my opinion that they will handle NATO better than the army can. They
    are not irrational idiots. They can calculate profit and loss and make whatever
    decisions suit them."

  content: "\"They are not irrational idiots. They can calculate profit and loss and
    make whatever decisions suit them.\"   Actually they are. If we assume that
    the Taliban elite in 2001 knew about bin laden's plan to attack America. Which
    they probably had knowledge of, considering that Massoud was killed on September
    10, 2001 by Al quaeda agents. The Massoud assassination was most likely as negotiated
    price for the taliban giving the green light to the WTC operations.    If
    the Taliban did not think that a massive attack on america, which was supposed
    to hit the pentagon, WTC and the white house would not have elicited an invasion
    from the world hegemonic power and overthrow of their pithy regime...well....
    \ allow me to paraphrase de niro in Casino \"Listen, if you didn't know you're
    bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you
    were in on it. Either way, you're out. Get out! Go on. Let's go. \""

    how to play with the big boys. The past tells us that when big boys are playing
    games, Pakistani nation lose their shirt. Lets look at the so called game of Pipelineistan,
    when the game is over and the dust is clear,  Pakistan  as a country will no longer
    standing as single unit, instead a combination of two three states controlled
    by the neighboring countries.    What should Pakistan must do to make sure
    they survive as nation (just few top points): 1-Keep IMF and World Bank away
    from Pakistan as far as possible. 2-Pakistani national interest should be top
    priority of the establishment regardless which party and which general in power. 3-Universal
    Education and justice for all its citizens.  Then may be Pakistan can play
    with the big boys."

    they can have the life over there as they wish but then they need a visa to come
    to other parts of Pakistan and then they shouldn't expect any help from others
    and learn to take care of their problems themselves. But you know the mess they
    create by doing Heroine and Arms business even in Afghanistan we the people who
    have to work for bread and butter suffers.  BTW Pak Army has full share of that
    drug business and they aren't ready to let go such &ldquo;Huge&rdquo;

     I agree with you. I suspect that if they do consolidate the Islamic emirate,
    the real problem will not be about visas. I think they will want to conquer Pakistan
    and they will find some collaborators in that effort. In any case, they will not
    be peaceful neighbours. My point was just that occupying them against their will
    is a very expensive proposition. Much better to try and hold them at the border..."

  content: "Omar,   Look at the Taliban in August of 2001. They had control
    of 80 percent of a country, with the remaining 20 percent waiting to be taken,
    they had cash coming in from saudia, they had military/logistical support coming
    in through Pakistan.  Heck, The taliban killed a bunch of Iranian diplomats and
    even Iran was fearful of going to war with them. Moreover, let us not forget about
    the gas pipeline, and representatives of the Taliban visiting Washington in the
    late 1990s.  And let us not forget they could impose any type of law they wanted
    without succumbing to international pressure. Not bad by all accounts.    Now
    look at the Taliban 2009: Fighting on two fronts versus two enemies, the government
    of Pakistan, the other NATO.  The most popular and liberal president in recent
    memory wants to make afghanistan his  personal war, so he can look strong on defense.
    \   And for what? Let's say the US cuts a deal with them and they come back
    into the fold in some sort of power sharing agreement, they won't have carte blanche
    to run the country like they previously had.  Very similar to Trading a condo
    for a box on the street."

  content: "First of all, why do we even equate the two varieties of the Talibans?
    They are not the same, the two don't see eye to eye, and both have differing goals
    and agendas. The TTP is mainly a bunch of crooks, dacoits and have political and
    financial goals.  In order to achieve these goals they are mainly targeting
    the local figures of authority, mainly the police, politicians and local civil
    administration through acts of terrorism, killings, slitting throats and then
    distributing the videos of all such acts to intimidate and scare the general populace
    into submission. They are doing this all while hiding behind the garb of dacoits
    and the ideology of Islam and we are too stupid and blind to see this. Open your
    eyes, know your own religion and see them for what they are, certainly not Muslims,
    but common criminals and animals!"

  content: "Apocalypse Now. Run for cover. The turbans are coming. This is the state
    of Pakistan today, according to the current hysteria disseminated &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.  Why
    the hysteria?  There are several reasons:  There are canyons of the Pakistani
    military/security bureaucracy who would love nothing better than to extract even
    more US dollars from Washington to fight the Pashtun neo-taliban. What is never
    mentioned by US corporate media is the tremendous social problems Pakistan has
    to deal with because of the [ongoing horror] of at least 1 million people now
    displaced (not to mention badly in need of food aid).  The myth of Talibanistan
    anyway is just a diversion, a cog in the slow-moving regional big wheel - which
    in itself is part of the new great game in Eurasia.   During a first stage
    - let's call it the branding of evil - Washington think-tanks and corporate media
    hammered non-stop on the \"threat of al-Qaeda\" to Pakistan and the US. FATA was
    branded as terrorist central - the most dangerous place in the world where \"the
    terrorists\" and an army of suicide bombers were trained and unleashed into Afghanistan
    to kill the \"liberators\" of US/NATO.  In the second stage, the new Obama
    administration accelerated the Predator \"hell from above\" drone war over Pashtun
    peasants. Now comes the stage where the soon over 100,000-strong US/NATO troops
    are depicted as the true liberators of the poor in Af-Pak (and not the \"evil\"
    Taliban) - an essential ploy in the new narrative to legitimize Obama's Af-Pak
    surge.  For all pieces to fall into place, a new uber-bogeyman is needed.
    And he is TTP leader Baitullah Mehsud, who, curiously, had never been hit by even
    a fake US drone&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. And maybe there won't be!  The myth
    of Talibanistan By Pepe Escobar http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KE01Df01.html"

    whom? Apparently, there is a big battle going on in Malakand division. I am not
    asking about the grand narrative. Just who is fighting against the army in Swat,
    are they winning or loosing? and what do they represent? What do they represent
    locally (again, I am not talking about whether they can really invade Islamabad
    or not). Personally, I think its exactly what is advertised by both sides.
    Taliban are fighting the Pak army. That does not mean they dont have some contacts
    under the table. I am sure the army is still trying to get them to do a quiet
    withdrawal and the shelling will stop. I think they are unwilling to do so because
    by now even THEY dont trust the Pak army. And I dont think the army can really
    defeat them in a few weeks (or even a few months). And I dont think they are about
    to take over Islamabad, but I think they can cause a lot of trouble. But I
    am eager to hear what the academics think.."

    killers. He was told he is next and he took refuge in Prime minister house and
    cut deal with powers to be and bought safety of president house with his party
    now paying the political price. Musharraf had at least 3  widely known attacks
    on his life for a lot many unknown. In one 14 people got killed. He still lives
    in Army house and while he was on lecture tour, he was provided bullet proof vehivle
    which would take him direst to the aeroplane rather than boarding through  regular
    gates. So they are not laughing to the bank anytime soon. The farcical part

    or Pakistan, the people of Pakistan want? How can you have one part of Pakistan
    living in stone-age, no education, no rights and the rest of Pakistan reflecting
    a total different picture of progress, education etc.?  No! Nobody wants
    those idiot, irrational people. If they did, the people of Swat would have welcomed
    them with open arms and voiced their satisfaction with that maniac, cruel and
    murderer rule. So please stop defending them. They are not only creating trouble
    within Pakistan with their nonsensical acts, but spoiling the image of Islam and
    Pakistan abroad.  Soon after 9-11 we used to defend our country's reputation
    by pleading that Taliban/Al-qaeda is not what Pakistan is all about. Now with
    these bunch of irrational, extremist terrorists, Pakistan is being depicted in
    the news as a population of fanatics and terrorists Taliban.  They are a
    small fragment, mainly consisting of Afghanies and even other border nationalities
    like Tajiks etc. They do not represent us and we won't let them ruin our country

  content: "\"Pakistani army sources are presenting the operation as an extensive
    and determined effort to isolate a relatively small group of extremist militias.
    But three factors - the failure to cope with refugees, the ability of the militias
    to disperse, and the rapid provision of aid by radical movements - suggests that
    the long-term effects of the army's campaign could be to intensify Pakistan's
    divisions. The Lahore bombing and Peshawar attacks may be early signals of that.\" Pakistan's
    war on civilians: http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/pakistan-s-war-on-civilians  \"Every
    time the army drops a bomb or fires a bullet in the north-west it is in danger
    of stirring up resentment among some civilians which will create new enemies in
    future years. The militants in Swat may well lose the battle over the coming days
    and the future of Baitullah Mehsud appears increasingly uncertain. But unless
    the Pakistani government - and indirectly the international community - changes
    its tactics, the Taliban can still win the war.\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8078947.stm
     ****  hmm, why think of other tactics when you can delude yourself that
    you can bomb your way out of a problem?"
