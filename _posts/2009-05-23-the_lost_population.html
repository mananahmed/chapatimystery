  content: "RE: \"Since 2007, there have been numerous bloody incidents in Karachi
    of MQM groups killing and destroying Pashtun neighborhoods and businesses.\"\r\n\r\nI
    might add that the Karachi society's \"well heeled\" segment has been conspicuous
    in its acceptance of the MQM logic, and on my recent trips to the city I have
    frequently heard explanations turning on the \"necessity\" of \"controlling\"
    \"these people\", who are proliferating, taking over, etc.  [Whether or not (e.g.)
    ethnic Pashtuns are displacing other ethnic groups from (e.g.) fruit markets has,
    of course, nothing to do with the Taliban, but \"Taliban\" is being used as a
    code to settle ethnic scores.] That a group composed almost exclusively of the
    descendants of migrants from (what is now) India should have adopted the \"outsider\"/\"native\"
    rhetoric demonstrates yet again how there is no \"essential\" ground in political
    reality..."

    code word &acirc;&euro;&oelig;taliban&acirc;&euro;\x9D for all pukhtuns for settling
    scores and ethnic politics is also my observation &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; besides
    the reasons of economics and resentment as to why these folks are not taken care
    of closer to their region in Punjab.\r\n\r\nThe NYT reports that landless peasants,
    enraged at years of corrupt government and a bumbling legal system, comprise the
    core of the TTP's shock troops in Swat. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This nation, after
    all, often seems nothing more than a slow procession of sorrows.\r\nWe are in
    the midst of the greatest internal refugee crisis in Pakistan's history. Perhaps
    close to two million souls, adrift in the brutish netherworlds of makeshift camps
    and slum cities.&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n\r\nJalib verses give expression to the plight

  content: "I love how this blog has an undercurrent of \"Pakistani Pushtuns are not
    Afghanistani Pushtuns, There is a difference!\"    What is the difference exactly?
    fake nation states with no borders? tribal affiliations? Do you think the ordinary
    person in NWFP considers himself more Paki than the pushtun in Kabul? Really?
    I think not.  Maybe that's the reason NWFP and FATA have no central government,
    because those ethnic people do not recognize the authority of Pakistan over them.
    \r\n\r\nSo what will be the result of this war on Swat? More ethnic divisions
    in Pakistan.  Who says the taliban (or the Pakistani Taliban as you people like
    to call them) will not become a vehicle for national determination for an entire
    ethnic group? So now you have the Baluchis (http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=126&amp;art_id=nw20090523203259137C275237)
    and the Pushtuns in open rebellion with the Sindhi's waiting.\r\n\r\nPakistan
    as Yugoslavia, with Punjabis as Serbia, Bosnian muslims as Pushtuns and Croats
    as Baluchi's.  What can one say? The British handed this country rancid lemons,
    and now they are being infected by the lemonade they drank from it."

    \"fake\", none are \"natural\" -- though some imagine themselves to be so, and
    some are able to create facts on the ground, thereby confirming their naturalness
    in a circular way (e.g. Germany seems more \"natural\" today than it did in 1930,
    with millions of ethnic Germans living outside Germany's borders.  That virtually
    all Germans are now gathered in Germany is not the result of nature but of war,
    upheavals, and population transfers at the end of WWII)."

    I suspect the answer will not be different (from the one a Lahori might give)
    if the Pashtun is from Peshawar or Mardan; can't say about FATA."

    I've very close relations with ANP supporters but they say things are getting
    scary over there.  Pak Army need to finish the job ASAP so these people can live
    their live peacefully, its not nice to be displaced from your home. But I hear

    to discipline your own people."

    actors?\r\nWhat are their interests?\r\nWho is the invader?\r\nWho is occupier?\r\nWhat
    would be a just solution of these conflicts?\r\n\r\nPakistan's economy is in the
    clutches of international monetary institutions, by design and by failure of political
    system, where people like Shaukat Aziz/Musharraf/Zardari 9and all their predecessors)selling
    it out and no organized opposition.\r\nPakistan can not pay this huge standing
    army.So it has to do the dirty work for the highest bidder.\r\nTo me one solution
    could have been to dissolve the standing army altogether and rely on volunteer
    forces, but  the time fort hat may have already passed."

  content: "From what I gathered IDPs are in bad shape and the ethnic politics of
    Pakistan is not helping the situation.\r\n\r\n\"More pain was inflicted on the
    Pakhtun psyche by certain PPP leaders, including its blundering spokesperson Fauzia
    Wahab, when the IDPs were equated to the Afghan refugees. If this isn't a slip
    of tongue, then it obviously means that many politicians and also other likeminded
    people from different walks of life in Punjab and Sindh have come to believe that
    the Afghan refugees too are primarily Pakhtuns and all of them need to be kept
    out of Pakistan's two biggest provinces to avoid harm.\" ... \"The apathy of some
    of the Sindh- and Punjab-based political forces to the woes of the IDPs looks
    all the more glaring when one compares it to the unparalleled generosity shown
    by the common people all over the country. In particular, the way the people opened
    their hearts and homes to the IDPs in NWFP was heart-warming to say the least.
    Nowhere was this magnanimity more visible than in Mardan and Swabi, the two districts
    that have received most of the displaced persons coming from neighbouring Swat,
    Buner and Dir. \"\r\n\r\n\"Fallout of Swat military operation\" by Rahimullah

    a cosmopolitan city with all the races representing Pakistan and beyond, living
    ther in millions. How is it racist to mention karachi? Hatred against what? Racist
    against whom?"

  content: "Yes Man said \"Do you think the ordinary person in NWFP considers himself
    more Paki than the pushtun in Kabul? Really? I think not. Maybe that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    the reason NWFP and FATA have no central government, because those ethnic people
    do not recognize the authority of Pakistan over them.\"\r\nThere is one major
    difference between the Afghan and Pakistani Pakhtoon -- that of language, a basic
    cultural component.  The Afghans speak more Dari, the national language of Afghanistan,
    adn the 'Pukhto' they speak is a different dialect.  Similarly, southern Punjab
    is largely Seraiki-speaking and culturally different than northern Punjab (say,
    Gujranwalla).  These differences translate into people maintaining their cultural
    cohesiveness even if outsiders lump them all as 'Punjabis' or 'Pukhtoons', specially
    when these areas are economically underdeveloped.  I doubt very much that any
    Pakistani 'Pukhtoon' considers her/himself 'Afghan' as a cultural or socio-political
    entity.  There are differences between the Swat Pukhtoons and those from Bannu!
    leave alone accross a border few have crossed (bar the taliban, traders, smugglers
    etc).  You would have to ask those Afghans who have been refugees for years in
    Pakistan if they now consider themselves 'Pakistani', and some may say 'yes' because
    they don't want to offend you, the Pakistani host.\r\nI don't understand what
    you mean by 'NWFP and FATA have no central government', and why lump them both
    together with reference to their governance?"

<p>The Swat offensive continues to generate humanitarian crisis. A crisis which the Army or the state are failing to deal with. In Karachi, MQM - the major political party and social group - has <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/12-mqm-wants-idps-restricted-to-special-camps--bi-02">adopted</a> the language of TALIBOTHRA to deny safety and comfort to the IDPs. Tensions between the Pashtun and the Muhajir (basically, two large immigrant groups in the Karachi megapolis) date back to the 1980s. Since 2007, there have been numerous bloody incidents in Karachi of MQM groups killing and destroying Pashtun neighborhoods and <a href="http://www.ummatpublication.com/2008/11/28/lead20.html">businesses</a>. </p>
<p>Some are <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/11-rejection-of-idps--il--03">rejecting</a> the demonization of IDPs but I fear it is <a href="http://www.samaa.tv/NewsDetails.aspx?ID=9073">not enough</a>. The Pakistan Army is doing its customary best to tell us that only the Taliban are dying in the region, even as <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C05%5C22%5Cstory_22-5-2009_pg3_2">others call for</a> even more violence towards the region. </p>
<p>Again, the calculus of displacing a million to catch or kill a few thousand makes little sense to me. I do confess that I am no military strategist but it seems that the impulse here is that we "cannot differentiate" between the good and the bad. So we bomb from afar and on-high. And we have no strategy for the civilians.</p>
<p>In 1971, as the Pakistan army went into East Pakistan, the great poet Habib Jalib said: </p>
<blockquote><p>
You are sowing love with bullets<br />
You are washing the nation's face with blood<br />
You are sure that a path is being forged<br />
I am convinced that you are losing your destiny.
