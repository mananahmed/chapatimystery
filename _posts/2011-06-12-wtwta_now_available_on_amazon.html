    the whole time?

  content: "I saw this headline in the NYT on Sun, May 29, 2011 and thought of your
    blog and how detached from reality the NYT can be! There are a lot of \"gems\"
    in it! (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/world/africa/29benghazi.html?_r=1&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=tha22)  Headline:  \"In
    Libyan Rebel Capital, Shouts of Thanks to America and the West In Benghazi,
    Libya's rebel capital, Westerners are treated with a warmth and gratitude rarely
    seen in any Muslim country.\"  From the article:   \"Americans
    and, for that matter, all Westerners are treated hereabouts with a warmth and
    gratitude rarely seen in any Muslim country &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; even those with
    100,000 American troops &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; in probably half a century or more.
    People smile and go out of their way to say hello to them, and are almost shockingly
    courteous.\"  \"Here, even taxi drivers do not rip off foreign visitors,
    and when a taxi cannot be found, some passing driver will soon volunteer a ride,
    and will be likely to refuse any offer of payment. A big problem for non-Arabic
    speaking journalists who visit is trying to find a translator who will accept
    payment for his or her services.\"  Ridiculous."

  content: "I know I'm a delinquent...  Finally ordered this: am making a brief
    NYC-trip at the end of October; by then this should be awaiting me at my sister's
    place...  Sentimentalism alert: felt a lump of sorts when I first heard
    about this coming out; due to the investment and collaboration that is perhaps
    possible only where a blog (and a blog run by someone as generous as sepoy) is
    concerned..."

<p>If/when you buy it, and read it, I would appreciate comments on Amazon (be partisan!) and also your grandmother wants this book.</p>
