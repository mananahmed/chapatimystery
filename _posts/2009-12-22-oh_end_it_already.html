  content: "<i>shows the sharp contrast how two countries who started together have
    grown over the years&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</i>   An old theme to a degree,
    I still remember watching Brian Lapping's '\"End of Empire\" BBC series as a kid
    in the 80s, the section on South Asia began by saying something like 'in the forty
    years since decolonisation the successor states to British India have taken different
    paths and by most yardsticks of measurement India has been a success while Pakistan
    has been a failure'!  Still if you come from the bottom 20%-30% of society
    there isn't that much to separate the two."

    mean China to the north, India to the East. The US colonial project stays West.
    As for Iran, it stays where it is.  BTW I was talking about the Soviet Union
    <b>and</b> the US, both planet shaking powers, shacking up in Afghanistan right
    next door.  Glad to see we agree it might not end in the nicest way possible."
