    rel="nofollow">Russell Peters</a>? I remember him making loads of jokes about
    family.  Did you not count him because he's Canadian and has an English-sounding
    name?

  content: "hey!  i'm the guy from Cincinnati, \"which sucks for him.\"  ha ha!    thanks
    for the email exchange and for encouraging me to post.  = )  you make a
    very good observation about family jokes.  my theory as to why you don't see more
    is that most of the videos we comics post are filmed in comedy clubs, where the
    crowds are generally 90% white.  not to totally self-promote but rather
    to make my point... i do cover some desi family topics in this video:  http://youtube.com/watch?v=OBtzk0PypU4  about
    30 of the 75 minutes i do for private gigs tends to be desi/indian material (family
    trips, mandir, taking off your shoes, saying the long good-bye at parties after
    the men &amp; women sit in different rooms and the kids play in the basement).
    \   anyway, that's my 2 rupees.    feel free to hit me up to discuss
    further!"

  content: "\"You get lots of material about interactions with the pre-dominant caucasian
    society, prejudices, life after 9/11 etc. But no sa'as-bahoo
    jokes. No Auntie Ji jokes. Nothing even about mothers and grandmothers. And definitely
    no Sardar Ji jokes.\"  I think because these desis' audience(s) are not
    entirely desi...actually most of them are white. How would a non-desi audience
    know about who and what \"sardarjis\" are unless it is explained to them? It's
    difficult to translate jokes from one language, community, and humor to another.  But
    Lapata is right, Russell Peters definately makes jokes about families. Like how
    desi fathers all beat their kids, while the white ones don't. And how his parents
    are always trying to find him a suitable spouse.  \"The only people who
    can laugh at themselves in homistans are the Sikhs [Punjabis in general - maybe].\"  Oi,
    oi, what's this Punjabi-centrism? :)Gujaratis can laugh at themselves, too:  http://mrpatelrap.ytmnd.com/  This
    website floods my heart with pride and joy. I get choked up whenever I listen
    to this rap."

<p>At a dinner table, recently, I asserted that 'family' was largely absent from the routines of desi comedians. Their comedy was largely set in the habermasian realm of the public [yes that is a joke. of course, I would never say anything like 'habermasian realm'. ever]. You get lots of material about interactions with the pre-dominant caucasian society, prejudices, life after 9/11 etc. But no sa'as-bahoo jokes. No Auntie Ji jokes. Nothing even about mothers and grandmothers. And definitely no Sardar Ji jokes. Why is that? I wondered. I don't really know the answer nor am I sure that my assertion is even correct. </p>
<p>So, I compiled a list of desi comedians that I am somewhat familiar with - along with some links to their youtube etc. routines. Maybe you folks can help sort it all out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaISf4Uembw">Tinku Patel</a> & <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87aLof6FPk">Azhar Usman</a>. I was in a security checkout line at O'Hare with Azhar Usman. Fun.
<li><a href="http://www.funnyindian.com">Rajiv Satyal</a>. I really don't know much about him besides that he is from around Cincinnati. Which sucks for him. Trust me, I know.
<li><a href="http://www.harithecomic.com/videos.htm">Hari K. Kondabolu</a>. The tips for brown people is predictable but funny. Also see his blog entry on being a <a href="http://harithecomic.blogspot.com/2006/03/trying-to-seattle-down.html">desi comic</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcgvGqo_OUI">Aziz Ansari</a>. Ok. I love Aziz Ansari but, the only thing desi about his comedy is ... him. Nothing wrong with that and nothing funnier than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6bI7ziGPk">Clell Tickle: Indie Marketing Guru</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv0OPnHhXQk">Aladdin Ullah</a>. I couldn't find any links to his stand-up.
<li>Some more <a href="http://dabble.com/node/7786261">random ones</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqKigxCHlg4">Daniel Nainan</a>. Now he does tackle family. But is that because he is taking his cue from Margaret Cho, Eliot Chang and other Asian-American comedians?
</ul>
<p>Also, asserted at that dinner table: The only people who can laugh at themselves in homistans are the Sikhs [Punjabis in general - maybe]. </p>
<p>Feel free to take up either assertion.</p>
