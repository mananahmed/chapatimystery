    Sepoy,

    Post-independence India had Dara Singh; who later became a film and TV personality,

    The maharaja of Mysore still has a functioning akhara, but national level 'kushtis' seem to be things of the past.

  content: "Fascinating mini-history.  Those lassis sound deadly (in every sense of
    the word).  Were they served in small unglazed clay pots and topped with a healthy
    slab of malai, by any chance? To elaborate the historical memory angle somewhat,
    the legend of the mighty Pole Zbyszko continues to loom large.  On the one hand,
    there is apparently a chap in the WWE by the name of Larry who has taken on the
    name.  There also is a Polish beverage company (makers of such tantalizing concoctions
    as 'Polo Cockta', 'Maxer', and the truckdriver's fave 'American Guarana') that
    goes by the same moniker (their marvelous Zorro-themed flash site simply must
    be seen: <a href=\"http://www.zbyszko.com.pl/).\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zbyszko.com.pl/).</a>
    \  Most importantly, however, does anyone happen to recall the menacing American
    bodyguard from the over the top late-70s Amitabh-starrer 'Amar Akbar Anthony'?
    \ Aside from featuring the most delightful easter egg of all time and the corniest
    cinematic qawali this side of Nusrat-Eddie Vedder duets, the fillum had our friend
    Zbyszko taking on the forces Hindu-Muslim-Isayi bhai-bhai-bhai.  The good guys
    win of course, but Mr. Z continues to terrify many of us."

    the lassis were giant metal pints and the malai had to be spoon lifted. yummy lassis.

    being practitioners of this art and way of life. My father would take me to the
    akhara and make me work out so that I would build my strength. Whatever I am writing,
    I have seen with my own eyes and experienced personally. When a wrestler collected
    his prize money after a successful match, the first thing he would do was to purchase
    a couple of sacks of almonds and two large canisters of pure desi ghee or clarefied
    butter. It was normal for a wrestler to drink butter milk or lassi made from a
    kilo of milk and a kilo of yogurt. Some wrestlers would drink melted ghee, after
    which they would lie on a cot for a couple of hours during which they would not
    move at all. Then they would get up and declare with great pride, &ldquo;Khalifa,
    the ghee has been digested.&rdquo;\"  Lahore Lahore Aye: Lahore's

<p><img src="/img/pehlwan.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Naim Sahib forwarded a BBC story, I had missed, about tall, brown, brave, greased-up and ready to fight <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3808647.stm">pehlwans</a>. A persian word, pehlwan, means warrior or champion. It used to denote those who excelled on the battleground, besting their opponents. The greatest pehlwan was the Persian warrior-king <a href="http://www.shahnameh.com/Epic/12aRostam/index.html">Rustum</a> [don't be scared of the persian, just scroll down to see the pic near the end of the page]. As a "sport," it is roughly equivalent to wrestling (not WWE, the other mat wrestling). A contest consists of lots of gripping and holding (hence, the grease) which happens in the Akhara (the mud pit) and after which the champion gets the Gurz (looks like a mace but HUGE and made out of silver and gold with precious stones inset). The undefeated champions hold the title <i>Rustum-i Hind</i> or <i>Rustum-i Pakistan</i>.<br />
Perhaps the most famous pehlwan was Ghulam Mohammad Gama Pehlwan (1885-1953) who was the court wrestler for Maharajah of Patiala. I don't want, and don't know enough of, to go into the relationship between Indian wrestling and Indian nationalism, suffice it to say that the early c. 20th saw a great emphasis by Indian nationalists on training the body and creating strong, powerful physiques. Pehlwans were the ideal prototypes. They devoted their lives to clean living and their bodies to hard, physical exertion. Living and working communaly and in harmony. Gama became the epitome of that Indian ideal. A Muslim by birth, he was known as the <i>Krishna of Kaliyug</i>. In 1910, he went to London to fight the Polish world champion wrestler Stanley Zbyszko under the aegies of the John Bull Society. Gama defeated Zbyszko and was crowned as the <i>Rustum-i-Zaman</i>[Rustum of the Times] and awarded the Sir John Bull Belt.  Zbyszko's defeat was the triumph of India over Eurpoe, earning Gama immense acclaim upon his return. In 1928, Zybszko travelled to Lahore for a re-match. Once again, Gama prevailed and cemented his legend as the Unbeatable. You can read more details of this story <a href="http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_noble_0502.htm">here</a>.<br />
After Partition, pehlwani continued the glorious history in Pakistan. Bholu Rustum-i Pakistan and Jhara Fakhar-i-Pakistan are two of the many greats who became people's champions. The city of <a href="http://www.gujranwalacity.com/">Gujranwala</a> is the city of pehlwans - producing many many champions.<br />
From my childhood, I remember Antonio Inoki (the Japanese wrestler who fought Muhammad Ali) coming to Lahore and fighting Akram pehlwan and Nasir Bholoo sometimes in the late 70s or something. It was a huge deal and I remember flickering t.v. monitors showing the match.<br />
In Lahore, we used to go to the pehlwani neighborhood behind the Lahore Fort and buy some hardcore <i>Lassi</i> - made with yogurt, various nuts, honey, and who-knows-what. It added 5 pounds while you drank it and gave you some serious runs after an hour. good stuff.<br />
That the art of pehlwani is dying in Lahore is sad to hear but I am sure it will pick up soon enough as retro-cool comes back. I hope. I mean, the "briefs" look exciting enough. However, it looks like <a href="http://dungalusa.com/index.html">people in Texas</a> are up on it.</p>
