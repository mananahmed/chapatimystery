  content: "i think it's worth seeing... it starts with a muslim dick being shot off
    by the big b, and tracks his transformation into a sensitively speechifying cop.
    of course you have to wonder how someone lived to be a graybearded cop and never
    was confronted with police complicity in riots against muslims.  and of course
    nobody to the left of the sensitive cop is allowed a word edgewise. the biggest
    laugh in the theater came when the bad cop remarked than many muslim terrorists
    are educated and even have phd.s.   the love story is well done, with a heart-warming
    boy-standing-by-his-woman scene. go see it if only to hear \"MCP\" and \"pseudosecularist\"
    said in a movie.  but i'm surprised to hear you liked bombay, it did not exactly
    get the communalism combat seal of approval. - reader in newyorkistan"

  content: Perhaps the best movie Bollywood has produced on the issue is "Garam Hawa
    (hot air)"; it's an old one dating to the 60's perhaps and starring Balraj Sahni,
    one of the finest, though less known actors of Bollywood. Pity I dont remember
    the director's name and since the movie must've done bad commercially, it's very
    difficult to find a copy (not be missed if a copy comes your way). The topic is
    social problems confronting muslims as minority in India. Watching the movie,
    one finds that it's an intellectual speaking.  A  movie on similar issue (Sikh's
    struggle in India) is "Maachis (matchstick)" by Gulzar, one of my favourite directors.

  content: I very nearly forgot a movie on similar theme - in fact just the right
    stuff for u, sepoy - by the legendary Satyajit Ray. It is "shatranj kai khilari
    (chess palyers)", the first Indian movie by the master, it is based on Prem Chand's
    short story with the same title. It is set during the war of independence and
    the story is about two Nawabs who are more intereted in chess than their domestic
    or national duties. superb performnace by shabana azmi and sanjeev kumar. I saw
    it when I was in my early teens and consequently could not appreciate the mastery.
    Wont miss it if I can grab a copy now.

<p><img src="/img/dev.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>I haven't actually watched a Bollywood movie in many moons. While in Pakistan, I discovered the brilliance of <a href="http://www.screenindia.com/20020412/fcover1.html">Ram Gopal Varma</a> and want to see whatever he does next. However, an ad for <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/govindnihalani/dev.shtml">Dev</a>, caught my eye and I clicked on it. The story, I gather, revolves around two old police commissioners and politicians sparking Hindu-Muslim riots and, uh, a love story(?).<br />
Bollywood has churned some material on the issues facing Indian Muslims. Some has been over-the-top (that Sunny Deol thing, <i>Gadar</i> or <i>Border</i> or something) and some really interesting (<i>Bombay</i>) I really liked <a href="http://www.us.imdb.com/title/tt0112553/">Bombay</a> and am curious what Dev brings to the genre (and it's looking like a genre now). I used it, along with <a href="http://www.planetbollywood.com/Film/heyram.html">Hey Ram</a>, in a class and the students were quite taken by the movies - loads of good discussion.</p>
<p>so, any readers from homistan who have seen this movie, tell me if it's any good.</p>
