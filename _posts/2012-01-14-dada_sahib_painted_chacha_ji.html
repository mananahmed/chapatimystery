  content: 'D, I''ve always admired N.R.''s trompe l''oeil Pollock tribute.  A real
    tribute to his frankly jaw-dropping technical abilities, as in the Ajanta pastiche,
    as you point out. Seeing the portrait of Panditji is a real treat: thanks for
    posting it.'

Sepoy insists that I share this painting of Nehru by my grandfather. He also has asked me to share my thoughts and feelings. Here they are: When I painted Nehru, I didn't realize, at least not consciously, that my grandfather had painted him. When I found out, it made me feel kinda funny. </p>
<p>Look at the background of the picture. That's the best part! Dada Sahib had his own style, as we all know, but he also could paint in anyone else's style. Further evidence in <a href="http://hilobrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/art-norman-rockwell-connoisseur.jpg">this painting</a>, for which he painted the Pollock <a href="http://collections.nrm.org/search.do?id=233569&db=object&view=full">using the same methods as Pollock</a>. </p>
<p>As a bonus, <a href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Rockwell-Nehru.jpg">here</a> is a photo of him pretending to paint the Nehru painting.</p>
