  content: A dry-eyed yet moving description of the devastation. Thank you Professor
    Hoodbhoy!!! The last bit makes me wonder whether our subcontinent will ever get
    out of this moral corruption.

  content: "I wish Mr. Hoodbhoy  that you just highlight the problem that people are
    facing in devestated areas. Giving a notion that help is being given to jihad
    land and US Heles are flying over training camps and providing relief will give
    a wrong notion and many people will pull their hands from relief and donations.
    \n\nI believe the Jihad camps would have been destroyed too."

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/earthquake5.jpg">Pervez Hoodhbhoy - of whom I have written about <a href="/homistan/on_higher_education_in_pakistan.html">earlier</a> - sends this email report:</p>
<div id="blockquoted"><center>MY REPORT OF THE BALAKOT TRIP</center></p>
<p>Four days later, they are still not even trying to extricate the dead. From under the rubble of collapsed buildings, a gut-wrenching smell of decaying corpses now fills the town. The rats have it good; the one I accidentally stepped upon was already fat. If there is indeed a plan to clear the concrete rubble in and around the town, nobody seems to have any clue. But the Balakotis are taking it in their stride - nose masks are everywhere.<br />
<br />
There is good news. The Mansehra to Balakot road stretch, finally forced open by huge army bulldozers and earth moving machinery, is now available to relief trucks. Goods donated across the country are piled to the truck roofs. If there ever was a time when the people of Pakistan moved together, this is it. Even the armed bandits who waylay relief supplies - to guard against whom soldiers with automatic weapons stand at alert every few hundred yards - cannot destroy the euphoria of having this solitary moment of unspoiled national unity.<br />
<br />
Aid from across the world is making its way, and the United States is here too. Double bladed Chinook helicopters, diverted from fighting Al-Qaida in Afghanistan, weave their way through the mountains. They fly over the heartland of jihad and the militant training camps in Mansehra to drop food and tents a few miles beyond. Temporarily birds of peace instead of war, they do immensely more to soothe the highly Islamic, highly conservative, bearded mountain people than the reams of silly propaganda on glossy paper put out by the US information services in Pakistan.<br />
<br />
Visibility makes relief choppers terrific propaganda, for good or for worse. This is undoubtedly why the Pakistani government refused an Indian offer to send in helicopters for relief work in and around Muzzafarabad, the flattened capital of Pakistani administered Kashmir. In spite of a much celebrated peace process, Pakistan has also not issued visas to Indian peace groups and activists that seek participation in the relief effort. Sandeep Pandey and other Indian activists are very frustrated.<br />
<br />
Islamic groups from across the country have arrived in vast numbers. Some bring relief supplies, others simply harangue poor goat herders and simple tillers of the soil to tell them that their misdeeds brought about this catastrophe. None seem to have an explanation for why God's wrath was especially directed to mosques, madrassas, and schools - all of which have collapsed in huge numbers. And none say why thousands of the faithful have been buried alive in this sacred month of fasting.<br />
<br />
Bad news: the aid is still too little, often of the wrong kind, and is not getting to those most affected. Hundreds of destroyed communities lie scattered deep in the mountains. We saw helicopters attempt aerial drops; landing is impossible in most places. But people told us that they often miss and the supplies land up thousands of feet below or in deep forests.<br />
<br />
Distribution is haphazard and uncoordinated, done with little thought. In Balakot we saw relief workers simply throw packets of food and clothes from the top of trucks, and a subsequent riot. Hustlers thrive, the weak watch passively. Tons of clothes, lovingly donated and packed by citizens around Pakistan, but mostly useless because of specific cultural and<br />
climatic conditions, are mixed and scattered with garbage and rubble throughout the town.<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings about the army role. I did not see enough to validate a previous observation that they were shirking. But certainly, I did not see senior officers anywhere. The Edhi Trust gets full credit and more.<br />
<br />
For me personally, there was a sense of dejavu. Nearly 31 years ago, on 25th December 1974, a powerful earthquake had flattened towns along the Karakorum Highway killing nearly 10,000 people. I had traveled with a university team into the same mountains for<br />
similar relief work. Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had made a passionate appeal for funds around the world, taken a token helicopter trip to the destroyed town of Besham, and made fantastic promises for rehabilitation. But then hundreds of millions of dollars in relief funds received from abroad mysteriously disappeared. Some well-informed people believe that those funds were used to kick off Pakistan's secret nuclear program.<br />
<br />
Shall the present government do better? This will only be if citizens, and international donors, demand transparency and accounts are available for public audit. The clock is ticking. In barely two months from now, the mountains will get their first snowfall and temperatures will plummet below zero. There are simply not enough tents, blankets, and warm clothes to<br />
go around. Hundreds of tent clusters have come up, but thousands of families remain out under the skies, facing rain and hail, and with dread in their hearts. These families have lost everything but the tattered clothes on their backs. Some even lost the land they had lived upon for generations - the top soil simply slid away, leaving behind hard rock and rubble. Those without shelter will die. From a special university fund we have pledged a dozen families to rebuild their houses. This number can be pushed up to fifty with the<br />
amount you have pledged so far (assuming Rs 50K per house, where the cost is for wood and stone mostly). But ten thousand or more will be needed in the Mansehra-Balakot-Kaghan area alone, not to speak of adjoining Kashmir.<br />
<br />
That's all for now.<br />
