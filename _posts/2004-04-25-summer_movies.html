<p><img src="/images/ew.jpg" align="left" height="100" hspace=6>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335013/">The Company</a> friday night. It was ok. I was hoping for more back-stabbing, anorexia and mis-shappen toes. The music was good and there were some funny moments. Over all, it was good p.r. for the joffret ballet. And for a movie set in Chitown, it showed us scant of this beautiful city.<br />
While in the car, we were talking about whether anything besides Spiderman 2 was worth waiting for and ... came up empty. Well, EW came on Saturday and it is the Summer Movie Preview issue. Here is what I am psyched about:<br />
- <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/spider-man_2/trailer/">SpiderMan 2</a>: Sam Raimi is god. No doubt. and the preview shows that the studio is finally letting him be.<br />
- <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/">Super Size Me</a>: The guy managed to kill off supersize option at McD. If that is not a triumph of humanity, I don't know what is.<br />
- Beat Takishi's <a href="http://www.zatoichi.co.uk/">Zaitoichi</a>: The man is cooler than whip cream. And this is no sword lite &Acirc;&middot; la Kill Bill. Can't Wait.<br />
- <a href="http://joblo.com/upcomingmovies/movies.php?id=85">Bourne Supremacy</a>: Bourne Identity was a great little movie. This one has a different director - Doug Liman ran away - so, my enthusiasm is moderated.<br />
- <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/garden_state/">The Garden State</a>: The writer/director, Zach Braff, is funny on The Scrubs. The preview looks good as well.<br />
- List of Movies that Will Suck: I, Robot (Will "I-have-a-song-for-the-credits" Smith"), Before Sunset (Richard Linklater goes navel gazing. again), The Village (M. Night Boring), Troy (DUDE, it's like GREEKS!)</p>
<p>Ok. I have to go write a lecture on <a href="http://www.jamaat.org/overview/founder.html">Maududi</a> now.</p>
