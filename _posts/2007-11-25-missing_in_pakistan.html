  content: "That is an astounding figure&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;again, 50,000 brothers,
    fathers, mothers, daughters, sons.\r\n\r\nThere's much categorical
    reasoning about who disappears and why, and while here the government is not held
    up as the big bad bogey with a Gulag, there remains still a mystery attending
    each and every one of those lost souls.\r\n\r\nIt may be easier in the nature
    of things to account for fear and mistrust, especially where assessing information
    is concerned. Politically motivated agitation and propagand, censorship, and intimidation
    leaves new media viewers and old fashioned readers alike searching for verifiable
    reportage, and where it's not to be found or a public has found
    that it has been misinformed, trust both in language and in people decays.\r\n\r\nI
    wish I knew more about the development of common cause and trust across complex
    societies, especially as politicians and others develop power by siezing on and
    increasing the polarization between their positions, which they may do largely
    through suggestion and by making much of trivial differences between people.\r\n\r\nMobs
    don't keep records but governments do, and over time the truth
    comes out in old memos, orders, purchase receipts, and rosters; where such do
    not come to light, one need not overestimate the powers of the state."

<p><a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=81397">Missing in Pakistan</a> is a short documentary written and directed by Ziad Zafar, an independent journalist and filmmaker. It was shot in February and March 2007 and highlights one of the key causes of the judicial and political crisis in Musharraf's Pakistan: the extra-legal disappearances of ordinary citizens at the hands of Military Intelligence. It reveals, as well, that the average Pakistani citizen can easily draw a stark connection between US ideals and policy with the realities in Pakistan. It is time we did the same here.</p>
