    in Pakistan, but is there any particular reason why this poster would have been
    written up in English (and some Urdish, e.g. kuch karlou)?

  content: "Pakistan looks like a place on the verge of a meltdown. The Zardari regime
    is so hopelessly corrupt and inept (the justice Agha Rafiq farce is a good indicator)
    it cannot possibly hold things together or turn them around. Its a tragedy and
    I blame the two actors who had the most power to actually take critical decisions:
    the army, which has played a double game with America, created a jihadi infrastructure
    it no longer controls, destroyed all other institutions and ended the matter with
    destruction of the judiciary and the creation of this hopelessly corrupt manipulated
    democracy where they had the chance to actually allow a fair process and maybe
    establish a functional republic. They have cut the branch they are sitting on.
    \r\nThe other biggest contributor is United States Embassy, which has been micromanaging
    this sad show for several years with predictably awful results. The \"El Salvador
    Dream Team\" led by Anne Patterson is working on the assumption that Pakistan
    is El Salvador on a larger scale. They dont trust the people, they dont trust
    democracy and they are scared shitless of the rule of law. The irony is, the United
    States and even its most imperial ambitions, would have been better served by
    supporting liberal and democratic forces instead of relying on the army and the
    most corrupt politicians available. \r\nAs they say in the Urdu movies: ab dawa
    ka nahin, dua ka waqt hai..."

    and a couple of other editorials, place the blame fairly and squarely on the army...
    Kamila Hyat wrote recently that the fundos always seem to know when and where
    the next attack is going to be, there have been instances where the army simply
    hasn't attacked when it could have and should have, and there is the deplorable
    lack of action around Quetta even when there is at least a semblance of action
    up north... sadly, that too will now be wound up because of the tension on the
    Eastern front, tension which I'm sure the top brass in the army welcomes...\r\n\r\nI
    find it amusing that these new \"student movement\" types do not utter a word
    about the atrocities the Taliban are committing, like digging people out of graves
    and hanging them (a la Dr Najibullah)... a look at the Pakistani blogosphere makes
    for similar depressing reading... it is high time we got our priorities right,
    but if these students, who are often vociferous supporters of that wonderful,
    honest, upright playboy-cum-cricketer-turned-philanthropist-turned- Jamaati stooge
    Maulvi Imran Khan, are anything to go by, that isn't forthcoming...\r\n\r\nWhat

  content: "Just today, over 30 people who had lined up to vote in a bye election
    were killed via car bomb. Since the army and the \"militants\" are equally unhappy
    with the concept of elections, one wonders who picked the target? In any case,
    if the army is not actively working WITH the militants, it still has a very warped
    sense of priorities. India has not invaded or captured any Pakistani land since
    Siachen (which was never demarcated, so maybe its unfair to count that) but just
    in the last 4 years, the \"militants\" have conquered nearly 80% of FATA and a
    couple of districts in the NWFP. So how come the \"reconquest\" of this lost territory
    is not a high priority for the army? The army moved into Swat over one year ago
    and still the militants can hang someone in public in the tehsil headquarter at
    Matta? And for 8 months, the army has been steadily \"advancing\" into Bajaur
    and they havent reached the end of that agency (which is about 50 miles long at
    most)? \r\nAbout 60 years of \"pakistan studies\" coming home to roost, the less
    said the better. Imran Khan is a genuine hero (one of the few we have produced).
    His Cricketing achievements would be enough for any one person, but he has added
    to that his cancer hospital and now a college/University. He is not a bad guy,
    but he drank the Pak Studies Kool Aid in Aitchison and look at the nonsense he
    can spout when he tries to launch into history and geopolitics. Sad."

    never buy the army-has-ditched-the-militants argument... in the past, when the
    officers at least had a semblance of polish and grace, it was simply a matter
    of them putting their interests before the country and patronizing the militants...
    now, it is more sinister, with the petty bourgeois origins of the officers, and
    the narrow conservatism that is a part and parcel of that mentality, really coming
    to the fore... how many such officers can be purged? The lowly captains and majors,
    not to mention the JCOs and NCOs are teeming with such people, and purging them
    all would leave us without an officer corps... or for that matter an army... \r\n\r\nWith

    there is also no doubt that there is rot at the top... one finds it hard to believe
    that one of the largest standing armies in the world is bogged down by a ragtag
    bunch of terrorists... there is enough evidence, if one goes by the statements
    of the people in Swat and the ANP leaders, that the army is just not doing enough...
    dismissing them as \"conspiracy theories\" as you do just doesn't cut it... like
    you said, these militants care nothing for our country, which makes it all the
    more infuriating that the army is holding back... and it isn't just the army sticking
    to the failed theory of the terrorists being \"assets\" that they still want to
    use someday... the rightwing mindset of elements in the army is there for all
    to see...\r\n\r\nAlso, responding to \"threats and blackmailing\" as you call
    it is all well and good, but why is there the glaring lack of any mention of the
    Taliban threat in the posters in the original post, and in the current chest thumping
    on TV and the internet?"

    places than one. You need tools like helicopters to fight insurgencies, and the

    that those peace deals were a predicatable failure, they now condemn the army

  content: "Limited resources? It is well known by now, and even being discussed on
    TV here in the US, that the billions in aid that should have been used to kill
    the mullahs and develop counter-insurgency and guerrilla warfare abilities were
    instead diverted towards developing conventional warfare abilities tailored towards
    the \"Indian threat\"... if the money had been utilized better, you would have
    had your \"tools like helicopters\" and much else besides that... \r\n\r\nIt is
    ludicrous to suggest that a half a million-strong \"professional\" army isn't
    enough to tackle a few thousand mullahs... how much more do you need? Perhaps
    if they started being serious, a few thousand would be enough...\r\n\r\nAnd peace
    deals? If anyone is guilty of that, it is the army itself... and the ANP is well
    within its rights to condemn the army for not doing enough because fighting the
    mullahs militarily is the army's job, not politicians'... \r\n\r\nAnd I  beg to
    differ... there is everything to be gained by blaming the Jackboots for everything,
    because every single one of our problems has either originated with or has been
    exacerbated by the army... discussing its mistakes is the first step in realizing
    that by stoking religious fervor, it has taken us for a ride for the last 60 years...
    \r\n\r\nI would be the first to back the army if they really took the Taliban
    seriously, but the facts speak for themselves: Swat has fallen...\r\n\r\nhttp://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=20091\\18\\story_18-1-2009_pg3_1"

  content: "The entire number of 500K cannot be devoted to one single campaign, there
    are other internal fronts, and Pakistan has a genuine external threat from India.
    The army has to pay attention to all these fronts.\r\n\r\nThe insurgency that
    is currently afflicting Pakistan started in 2006, the aid programs started in
    2001. If you know anything about foreign aid, its that the donors who decide how
    the money should be spent, with the receiving country having a junior vote in
    it. Not every dollar spent on weapons that can be used against India is wasted,
    for example the Cobras, the T-59 tanks and the ammunition/armor the soldiers are
    using in Bajaur is all originally meant to be used against India.\r\n\r\nThe army
    has conducted operations in Swat, Bajaur, Hangu, Darra Adamkhel, Khyber and Waziristan,
    lost over 1,000 soldiers and suffered many thousands of casualties. If that doesn't
    demonstrate committment, I dont know what does. Anyone who doubt the army's sincerity,
    doubts it just for the heck of it. \r\n\r\nThe political parties like the ANP,don't
    acknowledge the failure of their \"peace deals\", don't visit the affected areas,
    and don't support the army jawans who are in the line of fire. Then they have
    the gall to condemn the army. All that shows is that politicans are worthless,
    and the army is making an effort."

  content: "The external threat from India, while it exists, has been blown out of
    proportion by the army and milked for all it is worth... a stroll down to the
    latest Defense Housing Society will be illuminating...\r\n\r\nYou bring up the
    500K figure again... admittedly not all 500K can be diverted to fight the mullahs
    because as discovered a few years ago, 50K or so (later reduced, to the enduring
    credit of the top brass) were found to be serving tea to our battle-hardened,
    democracy-loving officers in their humble messes or fetching vegetables for the
    officers' begums, those paragons of humility and asceticism... but returning to
    your figure of 500K, how many do you think are needed? Before the current crisis,
    were those numbers diverted to the tribal belt when it was obvious that more were
    needed? After this current crisis on the eastern front is over, will more be diverted?\r\n\r\nIf
    aid money is spent at the discretion of the donor, as you claim, how is it that
    all the aid we have received from the IMF, World Bank, US, EU and around a dozen
    Arab countries has not brought about any noticeable change whatsoever in any sphere?
    If it is spent at their discretion, do they specify which politician or General
    gets to pocket what percentage?\r\n\r\nAnd if the money really was spent on Cobras
    and T-59s, where is the lack of resources you spoke of? And if it was spent at
    the donors' discretion, did they forget to specify that the money was for developing
    counter-terrorism abilities?\r\n\r\nLike I said in previous posts, I don't doubt
    the sincerity of the jawans, 1000 or more of whom have been killed like you said...
    I do doubt the sincerity of the decision makers in the army... the proof of the
    pudding is in how good or bad it tastes, not in how much apparent effort is put
    in, and the results, even charitably, have been disastrous: they have failed to
    rout out a bunch of rag-tag mullahs... sure, \"operations\" have been going on
    in the places you've mentioned, sure, our brave jawans have died, but has that
    stopped the mullahs from holding sway over 75% of Swat? Has it stopped the massacre
    of our Shia brethren in Hangu and Kurram? I will believe the sincerity of the
    top brass when I see dead terrorists... \r\n\r\nAnd even if I were charitable
    and ignored the lack of sincerity from the Generals, whatever happened to the
    famed professionalism they've thumped their chests for all these years? How is
    it that they have suffered \"many thousands\" of casualties, as you wrote, and
    not managed to rein in the terrorists? There were reports earlier of officers
    deserting their posts... how come? There have been reports of terrorists knowing
    when and where the next attack is going to be... why?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ANP will
    venture into Swat when it knows that the terrorists won't dare blow up their homes
    and kill their leaders because they are actually being pursued by the army, not
    just for appearances' sake..."

  content: "Since you admit the existence of an external threat from India, it then
    becomes a matter of perception. I see the threat as real and large whereas you
    see at small. \r\n\r\nBatmen dont fight on the battlefield, soldiers do. The entire
    500K army is not made up of soldiers who fight. I will repeat that the army has
    to operate on external fronts as well as internal fronts, hence there is a division
    of troops. Just because you flood an area with soldiers, doesnt mean you will
    necessarily kill all terrorists as they hide in the civilian population and don't
    carry Terrorist ID cards.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly how the aid money was spent,
    but foreign aid is spent according to the directions of the donors. Some of it
    on military, some of it on govt, some of it on debt-relief. Pakistani soldiers
    currently serving in FATA have much better armor and rations then before, so the
    military part of the aid has not been wasted.\r\n\r\nWe have Cobras, however we
    don't have enough Cobras. Which is why Pakistan is buying some more. We also need
    equipment like NVG and communication sets, for which orders have been placed in
    recent years, and which are now coming into the inventory.\r\n\r\nIts not just
    jawans who have died. Captains, Majors and generals have also been killed in this
    terror war. The enemy is not a bunch of \"Rag-tag mullahs\". The enemy is very
    heavily armed with machine guns, land-mines, suicide-bombers, RPG's, explosives
    and even ATGM's as witnessed recently in Bajaur. Despite suffering thousands of
    casualties, and going against the public opinion of the ignorant masses, the army
    has stuck to its mission of eradicating terrorism. I call that bravery and professionalism.
    You doubt it just for the heck of it.\r\n\r\nThe ANP's original formula for dealing
    with terrorists through \"peace deals\" was a complete failure. They won't even
    acknowlege that, who care what else they have to say on the subject?"

  content: "A matter of perception no doubt... the Indian threat, in my eyes, pales
    in comparison to the threat on the Western front... too bad the generals, recent
    statements of the ISI chief notwithstanding, don't quite agree... Have you read
    Khalid Hasan's recent article that has received a lot of attention? He recounts
    an interview with Musharraf as late as 2006 where the dictator was furious that
    the journalists had the gall to insinuate that the Lashkar-e-Taiba should be reined
    in, because in his words, \"They are not doing anything in Pakistan. They are
    doing jihad outside\". This, and other articles which mention that ISI officers
    admit that they've been aiding the Americans AND the Taliban at the same time,
    point to the sheer disconnect the generals have with reality... their efforts
    to get the idiots from our side who went to fight in Afghanistan in 2001 out safely,
    their rigging of the 2002 polls to allow the MMA to be elected in Pakhtunkhwa,
    their insistence that those engaged in that phony jihad in Kashmir were different
    from Al-Qaeda, and yes, THEIR peace deals all point to how they view the Taliban/Al-Qaeda
    threat... yes, \"operations\" continue, yes, jawans and officers die, but have
    the generals really taken the war on terror to heart? Have they given up their
    pipe dreams of one day using these mullahs as \"assets\" in their needless fight
    with India again? Have they given up hopes of using them to invade Kabul again?
    I don't think so...\r\n\r\nI know that batmen can't fight... the point in bringing
    it up was the astonishing fact that a full 10% of the army, till a few years back,
    were batmen or waiters... how many officers do we have? How many batmen do they
    need? Recall from Pakistan Studies lessons that one of the reasons listed for
    the decline of the Mughal empire was the opulence of the army... this seems to
    be the case in the Pakistan army too, more adept at real estate and coups than
    actual fighting...\r\n\r\nAnd you're contradicting yourself now... in earlier
    posts, you had implied that we needed more troops... I quote: \"The army may be
    500K but you need more than that to fight an insurgency\"... but in your last
    post, you say that flooding an area with troops isn't the way to go either...
    perhaps you meant more equipment? Read on...\r\n\r\nSo the military part of the
    aid has not been wasted, you claim? The donors don't quite agree, as the next
    link from the International Herald Tribune, no propagandist rag by the way, suggests...
    it is from December 2007, but has anything changed since then that you may want
    to share? What of the money that had been squandered till then? Will the generals
    be held accountable? And you also claim that the money is \"spent according to
    the directions of the donors\"? Again, they don't quite agree, or there wouldn't
    be talk of squandering the aid... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/24/asia/24military.php\r\n\r\nIf
    the money had been spent the way it was supposed to, you would've had your extra
    Cobras, Night Vision Goggles and other goodies...\r\n\r\nI agree that the terrorists
    hide behind human shields, but is it always the case? The Americans seem to be
    getting pretty good with targeting high-profile Al-Qaeda targets... the intelligence
    seems to come from our side, so how come we are not hitting those targets? And
    what of reports that militants seem to know when the next attack is going to be?
    Is that bravery or is it professionalism? \r\n\r\nI would be the first to support
    the army if it really was \"going against the public opinion of the ignorant masses\"
    (the disdain for the common man that the faujis and their supporters have never
    ceases to amaze) and if it really had \"stuck to its mission of eradicating terrorism\"
    (one can only \"stick\" to a mission if one has actually started it)... I don't
    doubt their commitment \"for the heck of it\"... the history of their association
    with these mullahs isn't exactly the one that forces one to trust them, to put
    it very mildly...\r\n\r\nIf the enemy really is so heavily armed, doesn't the
    army bear some responsibility for that too, given how they've armed these people
    to the teeth until recently? If not, is it too hard to figure out where the weapons
    are coming from and act accordingly? Are they better armed than the Pakistan army?
    Is that the state of affairs after taking away a big chunk of the budget plus
    the foreign aid? If not, how come they are not suffering \"thousands of casualties?\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you can discredit the ANP, whose secular credentials by the way are far superior
    to the army, for going for peace deals, a disastrous policy no doubt, then there
    is no other entity in Pakistan that stands as exposed and as discredited as the
    army... their dalliance with the mullahs spans not a few weeks, as in the case
    of the ANP, but whole decades... all they've done since 2001, which I've mentioned
    earlier, suggests that they are unwilling to cut the umbilical cord from which
    the mullahs hang on to them... has anything changed in the last few days?"

  content: "Let me respond to your rant paragraph by paragraph.\r\n\r\n\"A matter
    of perception no doubt&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;...... Have they given up hopes of
    using them to invade Kabul again? I don't think so&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\"\r\n\r\nIndeed
    the internal threat from militants is greater than the one from India, which is
    why the armed forces, acting under the orders of the generals, are so active on
    this internal front. The claims made in the Western  media, by \"anonymous officials\",
    against ISI and Army are trash and are part of media pressure campaigns.  We have
    Taliban-trained suicide bombers attacking ISI employees, we have ISI agents assasinated
    by militants, we have generals killed in bombings, we have constant military campaigns
    in which jawans, lietenants,captains, majors AND generals are killed, yet somehow
    the army and ISI are still \"helping militants\". Given the enormous activity
    and sacrifices made by Pakistan Armed Forces as a whole in the past eight years,
    one had got to be a looney, or an enemy, to doubt their sincerity. \r\n\r\n\"I
    know that batmen can't fight&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;...this seems
    to be the case in the Pakistan army too, more adept at real estate and coups than
    actual fighting&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\"\r\n\r\nWell that was a British-era practice,
    and has been put an end by Pakistan Army. What's to complain about here?\r\n\r\n\"So
    the military part of the aid has not been wasted, you claim....If the money had
    been spent the way it was supposed to, you would've had your
    extra Cobras, Night Vision Goggles and other goodies&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\"\r\n\r\nThe
    IHT is owned by the New York Times, a Pakistan-hating newspaper which has been
    complaining about the money sent to Pakistan for far longer than that. Since the
    publishing of this article 13 months ago what changes have the Americans made
    in their aid programs to Pakistan ? Nothing. \r\n\r\nYou and the \"anonymous US
    officials\" mentioned in such articles also conveniently forget that the insurgency
    in Pakistan started in earnest in 2006, and a Cobra helicopter, or anti-insurgency
    troops, are not delivered or developed in 3 months.\r\n\r\n\"I agree that the
    terrorists hide behind human shields, but is it always the case?.....And what
    of reports that militants seem to know when the next attack is going to be? Is
    that bravery or is it professionalism?\"\r\n\r\nI don't know of any drones Pakistan
    has that can fire missiles. I also don't know of anyone willing to see such drones
    to Pakistan. You are correct that militants die in strikes supplied by our intelligence,
    which means those writing reports that militants have \"advancing warning\" are
    talking rubbish.\r\n  \r\n\"I would be the first to support the army if it really
    ....isn't exactly the one that forces one to trust them, to
    put it very mildly&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\"\r\n\r\nSince you ignore the entire actions
    made by the Pakistan Armed Forces for the last eight years, and since you only
    grudgingly admitted that jawans, captains, majors AND generals have lost their
    lives, you will always find some excuse not to support the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nbtw
    I don't know of a single American general killed in Iraq/Afghanistan but you don't
    doubt their committment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If the enemy really is so heavily armed......
    If not, how come they are not suffering &ldquo;thousands of casualties?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe
    enemy is heavily armed because their weapons, which are of Eastern European/Soviet
    bloc variety, are smuggled across the border. This is why the insurgents near
    to the Afghan border are the strongest. There are many Pakistanis, who suffer
    from irrational hatreds, and have no problem taking money and supplying these
    militants. Every battle has casualties, you see the US military suffering casualties
    as well. The important point is that they continue the mission, which is what
    Pakistan Army is doing.\r\n \r\n\"And if you can discredit the ANP, whose secular
    credentials....\r\nfrom which the mullahs hang on to them&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    has anything changed in the last few days?\"\r\n\r\nThe ANP has nothing to contribute
    to anti-militancy, yet they will scream against the only institution that is actually
    fighting these militants. No ANP person has the courage to visit Swat, Hangu,
    Khyber or FATA, they hide in their homes and issue statements. I don't care about
    their statements.\r\n\r\nThe Armed Forces is currently busy in Mohmand, because
    many militants have fled the recent operations in Bajaur to Mohmand. The army
    is also busy in Swat and Khyber. I see the army doing its job, you see something
    else due to your irrational hatreds."

  content: "Predictably, the ad hominem, below-the-belt cheap shots are raining in
    now... In your first post, questioning the army was a \"conspiracy theory\", now
    I'm a \"Loony\" and/or an \"Enemy\" suffering from \"irrational hatreds\", questioning
    the army is a media pressure \"campaign\" and the IHT's comments can simply be
    explained away as part of an anti-Pakistan policy... you might as well go ahead
    and call everyone not agreeing with you a CIA/RAW/Mossad agent... just remember
    that when you have to resort to cheap shots at your opponents and dismiss everything
    going against your beliefs as a conspiracy theory or plot or campaign, deep down
    you know of the fallacies in your arguments...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of dead generals
    as you are so fond of doing, how about Amir Faisal Alavi and his foretelling his
    own assassination and what he had to say about Army-Taliban relations? Or did
    he turn his back on us and become a \"loony/enemy\" too by virtue of being V.S.
    Naipaul's brother-in-law and speaking to an \"anti-Pakistan\" newspaper?\r\n\r\nIn
    his words, we were \"not pulling our weight\" in the war against the terrorists...
    that is what I have been saying in my posts... I salute the officers and jawans
    who died fighting the terrorists, but there is plenty of evidence that there was
    a lot else being done by the army itself that undermined that very fight... you
    cannot invoke the name of our dead soldiers and claim that all is well within
    the army... as a matter of fact, it is in insult to their ultimate sacrifice,
    laying down their lives for their country, that their own institution has helped
    to undermine those sacrifices... but wait, journalists filing reports with such
    allegations are simply \"talking rubbish\"... I take my words back...\r\n\r\nSo
    there are no Batmen in the army now? Only Supermen?\r\n\r\nIf the Bush administration
    didn't change the aid package, that is because their viewpoint was that they have
    to tacitly agree to the wastage of money as long as some of it does get spent
    the right way... the fact that the aid didn't stop is no proof that the generals
    did not squander it... parallels can be drawn to how a different generation of
    generals filled their pockets in the 80's...\r\n\r\nI don't recall suggesting
    that we should order drones... the fact that terrorists are killed with our intelligence
    does not mean that other terrorists aren't given advance warning... the army has
    only recently said that they consider Al-Qaeda, Taliban and Kashmiri \"freedom
    fighters\" one and the same thing... could it be that the policy of differentiating
    between them lingers? The terrorists being killed in the drone strikes are often,
    if not always, foreigners...\r\n\r\nI am not ignoring the army's sacrifices during
    the last eight years, as you allege over and over... what I refuse to do, is to
    ignore their shenanigans over the last 60 years and their double game during the
    last eight... American generals and Iraq are of no concern to me either, so please
    don't put words in my mouth...\r\n\r\nAnti-insurgency troops are not developed
    in three months? Fair enough... even if the current insurgency started in 2006,
    they should have foreseen it in 2001... eight years aren't enough either? And
    if cobras aren't delivered in three months, how long does it take? When will they
    be delivered? Lets see if we see a dramatic improvement then...\r\n\r\nSo the
    terrorists are heavily armed and our army will suffer casualties? I have no problem
    with that, but my question was how the army suffers from \"thousands of casualties\"
    when the terrorists are supposed to number a few thousand, and whether the terrorists
    are better armed than the army... better armed with Eastern European type weapons?
    I couldn't help but notice how you mention that people suffering from \"irrational
    hatreds\" fund the terrorists, and you later use the same term for my feelings
    towards the army... I do hope this was unintentional...\r\n\r\nYou may not care
    for the ANP's statements, but I don't see how what you wrote was an answer to
    the paragraph in my post you were supposed to be answering... I'll repeat, if
    anyone is discredited because of deals, it is the army, and that it has given
    us plenty of reasons to suspect its sincerity in tackling the terrorists because
    of its chequered history..."

    read something in one article, linked it to generation in the 1980's, then gave
    another opinion on why the aid program by Bush wasn't changed, and complained
    that the insurgency that began in 2006, should have been forecasted in 2001...and
    then something about \"Supermen\".\r\n\r\nYou malign Pakistan Armed Forces by
    presenting your opinions/forecasts as facts and then linking it to some article
    which supposedly confirms your claims. Additionally you have to be dragged kicking
    and screaming to admit some sacrifices of Pakistan Armed Forces, while still refusing
    to acknowledge their actions on behalf of the security of Pakistan. That is called
    cheap shots and irrationalism."

    strange about the idea that the army is fighting the Taliban who want to overthrow
    Pakistan's government, the people who want to get even but aiding the terrorists
    who want to attack India and providing tacit support to Islamic right wing parties
    who support the army against democratic Pakistanis who want to reduce the power

    \ It is helping the LeT and other terrorists who are attacking India.  It is mostly
    ignoring the Taliban who don't want to attack it, presumably on the theory that
    the US can take care of itself and the Pakistan army is not in need of additional

    the majority of terrorist in Pakistan are locals, with a few foreigners hiding
    among them. Baitullah Mehsud, Fazlullah, the Ghazi lunatics and others are not
    imports from outside. These terrorist enjoy the support of a segment of the population
    who provide them with shelter and recruits.\r\n\r\nThe only force actively combating
    these terrorists is the Pakistan Armed Forces, and as Mr Musharraf said in his
    interview on CNN: \"If you weaken the Pakistani army and ISI, you will lose the
    global war on terror\".\r\n\r\nThe rest of Pakistanis society, whether they be

    for that matter suggest that the majority of the terrorists up north aren't Pakistanis?
    Straw man arguments galore...\r\n\r\nI agree wholeheartedly with your last paragraph,
    and that is what Sepoy said in the original post too... our people live in Cloud
    Cuckoo Land, harbor soft corners for the Taliban and fail to see the existential
    threat they pose to us... we need to embrace this as our war, and our people have
    failed to do so... our people do live in denial... \r\n\r\nAs for the army only
    combating the terrorists and not indulging in double games or doing things grossly
    incompetently, I suppose you and I can agree to disagree... \"Mr\" Musharraf can
    say what he wants to on CNN, who are only too happy to eat out of his hands, but
    his record says otherwise: insisting on a difference between Taliban/Al-Qaeda,
    peace deals, undermining the mainstream parties and giving the MMA a free hand
    in 2002, that deal with the MMA to extend his tenure, twiddling his thumbs as
    the Lal Masjid weirdos held the capital hostage, and that comment to Khalid Hasan
    that spoke volumes about his mindset vis-a-vis groups like the LeT...\r\n\r\n\"Weakening\"
    the army certainly won't help, but what about taming it, so that it doesn't conquer
    its own country again? What about reining in the officers, so that they stop treating
    Pakistan as a big housing society? And what about holding it accountable, so that
    we get to ask how many dead terrorists it has to show for the hefty defense budgets
    and foreign aid without being denounced for daring to do so? Are all these things
    wrong too? Should we wait to do all this as long as the army nominally tackles
    terrorists, the same way we kept our mouths shut for half a century as the army
    used India and Kashmir as battering rams to browbeat all resistance to its misdeeds
    into submission?"

The incursion, last week, of Indian jets into Pakistan's airspace has galvanized the predictably jingoistic public, once again behind the Army. The Pakistan Airforce has started running low-flying sorties over major cities (Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad). Newspapers are reporting that crowds cheer when the planes fly over. The major airports have cancelled flights - at least, for the duration. </p>
<p>Over the last two years, the armed forces of Pakistan - the titular leaders - rapidly became a dirty word. Musharraf, corruption, failure to secure the cities, operations in Baluchistan and NWFP, all contributed towards an emerging discourse of "Army is bad for the country". We saw the culmination of such sentiments in the February election and the resignation of Musharraf. </p>
<p>I am afraid those advances are now lost. On Pakistani blogs, the machismo of the "Pakistan, Fuck Yeah!" crowd is, once again, dominant. India is, once again, a militant target. Even the nascent student movement, which had taken to the streets during the Lawyers Movement, has donned the green colors of civil defense. </p>

<p>It is all frighteningly familiar. And here I was, hoping for change.</p>
