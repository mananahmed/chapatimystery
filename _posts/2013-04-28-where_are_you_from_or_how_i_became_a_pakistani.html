  content: If this isn't a conversation with a customs guy at an airport, I'll be
    damned. I freak out about this (hypothetical) conversation every fucking time
    I fly back from India to the States. In fact, this time, since I grew a beard
    in my time here, I have to shave it off before my flight back home. If this is
    real (ie nonfiction, rather than fiction), I am so sorry and empathize with you.

  content: I work with a Bengali doctor (51 yr old) ,  he was born in 1961 in Dacca,
    Pakistan. However one day he was telling me, because of you Pakistanis ,"I was
    once called Paki in Australia" I told him those Australians were genius that they
    recongnised his Pakiness eventhough he was only 10 when Bengladesh came into being.
    But kidding aside I have a proposal ,when any brown skin person is asked where
    you from, regardless of country of birth or education or residence , we all should
    say " I am Pakistani"  a good way to show solidarity with majority of suffering
    Pakistanis (on the geo-political chess board )and will also save lot of time to
    talk something else.

    made it difficult to pin down a suitable Label on a person , that shall quench
    the thirst of an enquiring mind to find the roots of any person.

  content: It is insane how others are always looking to label everyone else. Why
    can't we all be who we are and not be grouped into areas we might not even associate
    ourselves with or identify with. Most of the times the titles we are given are
    only to put other's at ease and pacify.

  content: I don't think that people need to be curious about origin of the speakers.
    These are the labels which de-value whole individual. For example if you are Pakistani
    origin and you are a great engineer, painter, coach, then listener will treat
    you just as Pakistani. It's tragedy especial in multicultural places.

  content: This is wonderful and many of us in various diasporas have experienced
    such a conundrum of queries... I am a Sikh and once in Texas I was told all Indian
    religious are about peace, and I could not resist saying "Sikhs carry daggers
    prepared for their enemies" kind of like Texans..

  content: I am American Indian, indigenous to this continent. I grew up in white
    America, so I talk, dress and act American. All my life I've been "other," not
    white, so people I meet think I'm from somewhere else. Japan, S Pacific, China.
    Overseas, people cannot accept I'm American because I'm not white. I don't live
    in diaspora, but have. Inside, I feel like anyone else, normal American. It can
    be aggravating, tho not always. We all belong right where we are. Anywhere is
    sacred ground.

  content: "Love it, ha!\r\nI'm always asking where people are from. I've lived in
    4 countries and visited quite a few others. Originally from the USA and can't
    hide the accent after 40 years out of there.\r\nAsked a rather dark fellow in
    Melbourne Australia once where he was from and he coldly said \"third rock from
    the sun\". Oh well. \r\nLoved the eloquence of Pradeep's comment. Hope I'm not
    jumping to conclusion that he is from India.\r\nI was surprised how much richer
    the Indian's English was than mine. Spent 3 years there.\r\nGood one Jyotsna Singh!"

  content: You are soooooo patient - I don't think I could have kept my tongue after
    "No, I mean, where is your family from?"  Everyone wants to put people in little
    boxes.  Once I was have drinks with some friends including Sally who'd emigrated
    here to Canada from Ireland a few years earlier. While we were all chatting, a
    fellow with an Irish accent joined us briefly and mostly seemed to be quizzing
    Sally - where she went to school, people she knew in Ireland, places she visited.
    After he left I asked her what he was doing.  "Trying to see if I was Protestant
    or Catholic" she said "Just like back in Ireland."   Little boxes,  little boxes.

  content: I was born and raised in Pakistan. Rarely anyone asks me where I am from.
    Why people are asked these many questions? If someone does,  I tell them and there
    is no further question. I think most of these stories are made up.

  content: he most shocking sentence is Urdu is pakistani Language . So sad Urdu is
    100% Indian language. Please do not say it is the Language of Pakistan. It is
    born in India and this Magical language will remain Hudustani.

  content: "I love this post! I was adopted from India and came to the US as an infant.
    I speak nearly flawless English, have brown skin and a Anglo name, since my parents
    are white folks. I am almost completely Western in all ways except for appearance,
    but I was born in S. India.\r\nI have had many similar conversations that begin
    with the exact same question. Some of us who are adopted, call it the \"narrative
    burden.\"  Thanks for sharing."

<p>&ldquo;What is your nationality?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Canadian.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You are Canadian?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;My passport says so.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But where are you <strong>really</strong> from?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You mean, where do I <strong>live</strong>?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You don't live in Canada?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, so where do you live?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Dhahran.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Tehran? You're from Iran?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, DHA-<strong>HA</strong>-RAN.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;In Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, you are Saudi Arabian?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, I live there.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you are not Saudi, so, where are you really from? I mean, <strong>originally</strong>.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You mean, where was I born?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I was born in Calgary, Canada.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, I mean, where is your family from? Where were they born?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;They are from Hyderabad.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, you are Indian! So, <em>why do you speak English with no accent</em>?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You speak American English.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I have gone to American schools.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;In India?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, in Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But you are Indian?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, my family is from India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;India!<strong> I love India!</strong> The Hindus are such a beautiful religion of peace! But why do you have a Christian name, Sarah? Are you Christian?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No. Sarah is also a Muslim name.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh. You are Muslim? I thought you said you are Indian?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;There are Muslims in India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But you don't<strong> look like</strong> a Muslim!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What does a Muslim look like?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I don't know. Like an Arab?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Not all Muslims are Arab. Most Muslims aren't Arab.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But you live in Saudi Arabia?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Do you speak Arabic?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why not? I thought you said you live in Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We don't live with Saudis in Saudi Arabia. It is not permitted by the Company my father works for. And, the American school in Saudi Arabia I go to&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;it doesn't allow for Arabic to be taught there.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What language do you speak at home?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Urdu.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But Urdu is the language of Pakistan, not India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Urdu is spoken in India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, yes, but if you are Urdu speaking that means you really belong to Pakistan.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But, my relatives live in India.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Did any of your parents live in Pakistan?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes. My father did, for a few years.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Then, that means you are Pakistani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But I've never lived in Pakistan. I've only been there once.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That doesn't matter. You are not Indian. <strong>You should say you are Pakistani</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
