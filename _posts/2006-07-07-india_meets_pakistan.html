  content: For people like me, whose immediate family left the sub-continent before
    Partition, describing someone as "half Indian/half Pakistani" is nonsensical.

  content: The East is full of cunning sorcerers and voluptuous temptresses. In one
    post, you proved both true. Damn you, Sepoy.

  content: I think it is worse than just gross. I think they are horrid and exploitative.
    I don't understand people who insist on shopping at AA because of their 'cool
    labor practices' while turning a blind away to the most degrading marketing campaign
    ever.

<p><img src="/img/aanorain.jpg"/>As I picked up the Onion, I couldn't help but notice the headline. The type says, "NameoftheGirl*. Half Indian. Half Pakistani. Was photographed in NY." etc. <a href="http://www.blacktable.com/graham050720.htm">Dov Charney</a> creeping his way to sub-continental peace [after solving <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/200409l.html">M.E.</a>]. My blog sucks. Officially. I blame you.</p>
