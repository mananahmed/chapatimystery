  content: In completely unrelated news, Samuel Huntington died on Christmas Eve...
    as someone who was forced into engineering and only dabbled in history, I did
    read his book (yes, that one), but my lack of training in the field makes me unqualified
    to comment without making a fool of myself... perhaps Sepoy can write at length
    on him?
