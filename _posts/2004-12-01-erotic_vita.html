    You are evil. This Blog brings light and truth to the oppressed masses of the world. Getting it blocked would be like the SUN itself is blocked.
    And, from what I hear, ookie gookie cookie needs never be explained. ever. certainly NOT at lunch.

  content: "Christ, ookie cookie is the great urban legend of prep school. So many
    times mentioned, joked about, but never done. Actually, if it's about prepschool,
    maybe it's a pastoral legend. In any case, it's such an urban legend that it
    was almost made to be the centerpiece of the <a href=\"http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Scavhunt</a> last year, from what I hear. The lady judges were
    all about it, but the boy judges were horribly squeamish. So, instead, a guy ate
    his own umbilical cord inside a Twinkie.  Ah, UofC."

    <strong>new games journalism, new erotica</strong>

    Two new fads in writing today. First, the so-called 'New Games Journalism'; second, high-brow erotica. It's almost the perfect d.p. post...

    As anyone who's slashdotted today will know, the so-called New Games Journalism is getting a bit of cover...
---
<p><img src="/img/vita.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6/>Blogs being pass&Atilde;&copy;, college kids have turned towards high brow erotica to express themselves in their ivy covered, gothic chapels of knowledge. By Google's account, Vassar's <a href="http://vsa.vassar.edu/~squirm/">Squirm</a> was first out of the gate. Followed by Harvard's ridiculously titled <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/05/25/harvards_sexy_h_bomb_magazine_drops/">H Bomb</a> and BU's even more puerilely titled <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/10/06/bu_students_to_get_own_sex_magazine/">Boink</a>. </p>
<p>So this week debuted U of C's version of this skin-rag trend sweeping liberal arts campuses: <i>Vita Excolatur</i>. I love the name. Only a UofCer would latinate the p&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&oelig;0nate.</p>
<p>I thumbed through the inaugural issue - for the articles. With due recognition for their first attempt, I want to congratulate the founder and editor for getting this off the ground. They have to be commended for seeing the trend and making sure not to acknowledge Harvard. Having said that, how do the UofCers manage to make sex so unhot; so unsexy. An essay [entitled, "Psychoanalyze this: Sexual Overcoding as Discursive Limitation"] starts off footnoting "free association" and drags us through Deleuze. Another examines the racism inherent in White on Asian fetish [what if it is a South Asian on East Asian fetish?]. Another tells us about o.g. cookie [don't]. While calls for future submissions enlist "pro-choicers to pro-Foucaultians". Sexy? uh, no. Intellectual? uh, no. P0&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&oelig;n should be p0&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&oelig;n, not your hum sequence reading assignment. The aforementioned essays try to titillate mind and body and end up annoying. While the tasteful art photography is just that. </p>
<p>Responses from a random sample of UofC folks (having lunch with me) were mixed. They appreciated the effort and enthusiasm but critiqued the lowering of intellectual standards. I quote:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">Why should you go about throwing in the cliffs notes along with the art? know what i'm trying to say? I mean they can be in there, but don't tell me that they're there. It's like if I were at the Fulsom Street Prison on one of the days that Michel Foucault was there, I would rather be surprised to see that bald frenchman in the sling than to be told that he was there and that I should go f&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&nbsp;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&hellip;k him before he puts his clothes back on. Man, that article really bums me out because I actually enjoy Deleuze and Guattari. And that girl is ruining both of those theorists for at least a dozen kids. </div>
<p>Only on the U of C campus, people. Only on this campus. </p>
<p>In related news: tsk informed me that CM is blocked on Chicago Police's ISP as a p0&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&oelig;n site. Uh, after this post, I expect my readers from .gov and .mil will need a mirror.</p>
