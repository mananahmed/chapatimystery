  content: The irony of the anti-Pakistan islamists migrating to Pakistan and becoming
    a potent political force is actually a testimony to the moral bankruptcy and opportunism
    of the political establishment.  Nasr describes how Maududi's truck was 'escorted'
    into Pakistan by the Pakistani army, and how he was welcomed by the Nawab of Mamdot
    who was looking for ways to undermine Liaquat Ali Khan and Daulatana.  The rot
    runs very deep indeed.

  content: 're: Nasr''s powder-keg suggestion, clearly he was thinking about the long
    held crack-pot academic liberalism that holds "truth to power" on the condition
    "when it doesn''t actually rock the boat." Or maybe Nasr thinks Zafrullah Khan
    should''ve been a better secularist and kept his religion on the down-low, taqiyya
    style, like Nasr senior. Unless of course Nasr''s religious expression becomes
    a great career move, then all best are of. Its not irony if you have to point
    it out, but serrriously.'

    stabbed to death in Narowal\r\n\r\nLAHORE: An Ahmedi man was stabbed to death
    in Narowal on Monday, just days after gun, grenade and suicide attacks on the
    minority group killed more than 80 people, police said.\r\n&acirc;&euro;&oelig;In
    the morning, a man identified as Abid Butt climbed the wall of the house of a
    local Ahmedi family and stabbed Naimat Ullah, 55, and his son Mansoor Ahmed,&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    local police station chief Riaz Sangha said.\r\nNaimat died of knife wounds and
    his son was rushed to a hospital, he added.\r\nThe attacker escaped, the officer
    said. Sangha quoted residents as saying that the assailant threatened to not leave
    any Ahmedi alive.\r\nSalimudin, a spokesman for Lahore&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Ahmedi
    community strongly condemned what he called a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;targeted killing&acirc;&euro;\x9D.
    afp\r\n===========================\r\nI have frequently seen in the anti-Ahmadi
    literature a charge made that Zafarullah Khan refused to join the funeral prayers
    when Jinnah died as commanded by his Ahmadi belief that all non-Ahmadis are kafir.
    Someone should do some research on that."

    Act II of 1954 to enquire into the Punjab Disturbances of 1953\"  http://www.thepersecution.org/archive/munir/index.html
    \ \r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nMy experience is that most Ahmadis do not pray behind a non-Ahmadi
    Imam, and the reason I was given is that in the congregational prayer, the congregation
    reaches out to the Divine through the Imam/prayer-leader. Hence, the Imam needs
    to be Ahmadi to reflect the views of the congregation and to represent an Ahmadi
    namazi. So, from that perspective, I can see why he Zafarullah Khan could have
    refused (if he did) to join the funeral prayers. I haven't heard that Ahmadis
    believe non-Ahmadis to be Kafir. My Ahmadi friends tell me that Ahmadis believe
    (Not unlike other sects) their community/sect to be the chosen people on the right
    path while the other sects to have gone astray ."

  content: "A third book came out recently: Simon Ross Valentine, Islam and the Ahmadiyya
    Jama'at, first published in England and now by the Columbia U Press. My review
    of it will come out soon in Biblio (New Delhi) -- or so they said. It is a slight
    book on the sect and its history as compared to the earlier two books--Friedman's
    being the best. But the new book tells a great deal about the community as it
    exists in England, and also its interactions with other communities.\r\n\r\nMirza
    Sahib was quite strong in some of his pronouncements, and some of his descendants
    stronger still. From what I know it was Maulana Muhammad Ali and the so-called
    Lahori group who put a much more amiable face on the movement and reached out
    to other Muslims. Muhammad Ali's English translation was very popular at one time,
    and more acceptably read -- as against Yusuf Ali's -- by the more questioning
    Muslims until seventy or eighty years back. Even earlier, Abudl Majid Daryabadi,
    in his autobiography, gave much credit to Muhammad Ali's translation for helping
    him come back to Islam after his substantial period of rejecting all religions."

  content: "Speaking of Amnesia, Erasures and Sectarian Black Holes. \r\nI am fascinated
    by the way Israel's unjust aggression against the Gaza Aid Flotilla has already
    overshadowed the horrendous carnage in Lahore. The attacks on Friday and the brazen
    incident at Jinnah hospital don't receive a sliver of reflection and outrage that
    these events deserve. Once again Israel's outrageous aggression becomes a convenient
    alibi to run away from any sustained reflection and assessment of what it means
    to be a Muslim in Pakistan. \r\n\r\nI was struck by this comparison after reading
    about the large protest against Israel's aggression that was organized by Imamia
    Student Organization (ISO) in Saddar Karachi. The ISO represents Shia Muslims,
    a community that has suffered many similar attacks, yet the ISO felt compelled
    to take out a protest near American consulate and face lathi charge to express
    outrage at Israeli atrocities but there is no similar showing of outrage or sympathy
    solidarity for the victims of recent attacks in Lahore. Its obvious why but that
    is what makes it so sad. \r\n\r\nHere is a letter that has been going around in
    chain mails on May 28 Massacre:\r\n\r\nDear All,\r\n\r\nAfter the attack on the
    two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore on Friday, many of you wrote with condolences. I'm
    deeply grateful for it and it meant a lot to me that you remembered me at this
    time. It's been an indescribably painful last few days.\r\n\r\nI'm emailing simply
    to make a point to everyone in my own circle of friends, some of whom I know and
    others I hope will have the honesty to see things for what they really are. This
    is not the first time that something like this has happened. On the 19th of this
    same month, an ahmadi was shot to the head in Karachi. Last month, three others
    were murdered in Faisalabad - and the list goes on. This is not unusual by any
    stretch of the imagination. Though I cannot contest that this attack on Friday
    was at an unforeseen level, but the point is that the Ahmadis are persecuted on
    a daily basis. If it is not a gun to the head, it is an assault, a threat, a slur.
    This has been going on since 1953 in Pakistan and though there have been so many
    non-ahmadi friends over the years who have supported us and helped us through
    the hardships, it is simply not enough. The emails I received with condolences
    and apologies melted my heart and I am grateful for friends like you, but at the
    same time I can't help but wonder why people like you don't contest this the way
    it should be contested. I have seen many of you go into the streets dodging gunshots
    and tear gas to fight for the right to a free and independent judiciary. Yet you
    sit back and quietly listen to the news as this discrimination towards the Ahmadis
    is reported on a daily basis. I don't want to offend anyone. What I want is to
    simply highlight that you all, as Pakistani citizens who have quietly accepted
    the atrocities committed against us for more than 50 years now, are also part
    of the reason for what happened on Friday. You have all signed your ID card and
    passport applications and placed a little tick next to a column asking you to
    declare that you consider us to be non-Muslims (\"I consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
    Qadiani to be an impostor prophet and an infidel and also consider his followers
    whether belonging to the Lahori, Qadiani or Mirzai groups, to be non-Muslims.\")
    As they say, silence is the worst kind of violence and you have all been silent
    for far too long now. Yet you made so much noise and fought so hard when against
    a military government and for the judiciary.\r\n\r\nI don't doubt your sincerity
    towards me or this community in the least, and I don't doubt your genuine desire
    to see Ahmadis get the same rights as everyone else, but I just hope you see how
    your silence has been a part of the problem and how it has propelled hatred towards
    us.\r\n\r\nWhether we are wrong or right in our faith is not a matter of concern
    at this point. Our lives are under threat every day and constitutional laws are
    in place penalizing every move we make. 'Assalam o Alaikum' can result in three
    years prison sentences and fines. Members of our community are in prisons for
    the last God knows how many years because they printed 'Bismillah' on their children's
    wedding invitation cards. And it doesn't stop there. Even 'posing' as a Muslim
    is a criminal offence. I just can't help but wonder why you, who found so passionately
    for the right to a free judiciary, are silent when it comes to these laws. Sadly,
    and ironically, I heard far more frustration and anger from friends in Pakistan
    when Facebook was banned than I have in defence of the treatment of Ahmadis.\r\n\r\nI've
    only sent this on to people who's friendship I value and I see in them the capacity
    to understand that this is not meant to be offensive, but only a reality check.
    I just can't tell myself that condolences and apologies are enough anymore when
    so much has happened, and when I have seen you fight for other issues so passionately.\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to pass this on to anyone who you believe has the decency to see things as
    they are."

    offered namaz-e-janaza of some non ahmedi martyrs. Besides, i have also heard
    that Sir Zafrullah refused to meet Zia ul Haq because of the dictators harsh laws
    against Ahmedis. He asked his attendants to treat Zia with hospitality but didnt
    agree to meet him in his last days. Has anybody done research on the role Sir
    Zafrullah played in the independence of Morocco and his contributions to the Arab

  content: "I discovered this conversation strand rather late but for what it's worth
    I knew Sir Zafrullah Khan quite well and as a young man had the opportunity to
    spend many hours with him.\r\nChoudhry Sahib was utterly devoted to Qaid i Azam
    and wouldn't hear a word against him.I had recently read a book on independence
    called \"Freedom at Midnight\" and had given it to him to read.The book paints
    an unflattering picture of Jinnah, and when Choudhry Sahib returned the book he
    told me that the picture painted of Jinnah was totally onesided and a distortion
    of the truth.When I asked  whether he could confirm that Jinnah was partial to
    a  drink, he replied \"Not in my presence\" and would not budge from that position.\r\nThe
    subject of Qaid i Azam's janaza also arose and Choudhry Sahib was quite adamant
    that the reason  he did not attend was that the man performing the Janaza prayer
    (Usmani?) was an arch enemy, of not just the Ahmadi movement (who had abused the
    founder), but someone who had consistently abused Choudhry Sahib himself in most
    abusive terms, and declared him to be outside the pale of Islam.\r\nSome friends
    and colleagues had advised him to avoid a controversy by simply not attending
    and feigning illness, but Choudhry Sahib that would have been dishonest and more
    to the point he felt duty bound to attend the janaza of a man who he not only
    regarded as a friend but someone he greatly admired.\r\nI pointed out to him that
    as a young  student in the 70's,Pakistani cinema houses would sometimes play the
    film of the janaza and that the camera would linger on a picture of Choudhry Sahib
    sitting on a chair during the janaza.The image spoke volumes without the commentator
    having to say anything.That was the only time that Choudhry Sahib looked rather
    sad and said that was a pity, as he was following his conscience, and people had
    misconstrued his honorable intentions.\r\n\r\nI suppose we all have the widom
    of hindsight, but suffice to say that is my own first hand account of talking
    to a truly great man and a Pakistani patriot, who is sadly totally forgotten in
    Pakistan"

  content: Insecurity breeds discrimination. It seems that the people most intent
    on making and implementing ridiculous laws were afraid of their own doubt. If
    one is content with their faith why should they pursue others for their faith.
    The rightness or wrongness of things are best left for philisophers to debate
    as long as they do not impinge on individual freedom and rights. Even if someone
    is shown to be wrong in their beliefs how does that affect the rights of others?  The
    only explanation lies in self doubt and pettiness. We need humane education badly.
    Only then can our eyes and minds be opened to the truth and we will be free of
    fear. The life and rights of any one will be as precious to us as our own for
    we will see in all reflections of ourselves.

<p>This picture, posted by Zackintosh on his <a href="http://twitter.com/kidvai/status/15122069250">twitter feed</a>, immediately arrested me. It was taken at/outside the Karachi Press Club, at a gathering meant to show solidarity of the Lahore massacre - sadly, a rather <a href="http://blog.dawn.com/2010/06/01/a-muted-response-to-minority-killings/">non-event</a>. It was the hand-written white sign in the middle, held high. The gentleman holding up the sign seems mature, and I wonder if he saw the irony - the tragic irony - of his sign. It says: "In Quaid-e Azam's first Cabinet, Foreign Minister Sir Zafarallah, was an Ahmadi." I infer that he invokes this name and this reference to point towards the tolerance and secularism interred in those early days of Pakistan. It is indeed true. </p>
<p>The irony is that this same sign mentioning Muhammad Zafrullah Khan - one of the closest advisors of Jinnah, who helped draft the Lahore Resolution Pakistan, served in numerous capacities including Pakistan's first Foreign Minister, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Judge at Hague - would be easily found at any anti-Ahmadi rally from 1934 to 1954. </p>
<p>The <em>Ahrar</em>, as an organization, had two tenets: socialism and anti-Ahmadism. Maybe not so much on the socialism but certainly very firm on the anti-Ahmadism. The founder Shah 'Ataullah Bukhari demanded in 1934 that Zafarullah Khan be removed from all offices. This they kept up throughout the next decade and into the 1950s. Zafarullah Khan was always the stand-in for the " secret Ahmadi control" over Pakistan (a position soon to be filled by Zionists/US/etc.) </p>
<p>From Nasr's work on Jama'at-i Islami: </p>
<blockquote><p>
The Ahrar continued to articulate economic grievances in Islamic terms, but with a new twist; it tied the demand for economic justice to the Islamicity of the state by questioning the status of the Ahmadis. Every harangue against the government policy and demand for greater Islamicity were accompanied by complaints about the decrepancy between the wealth of the Ahmadi community and the poverty of the Muslim masses: in the homeland of Muslims, it was the Ahmadis who reaped the benefits and the Muslims who suffered hunger and hardship. The strategy was by and large successful, though it was the Ahmadis themselves who set off the final conflict. </p>
<p>On May 17, 1952, the foreign minister turned down Prime Minister Nazimu'ddin's pleas of caution and addressed a public Ahmadi session in Karachi. By openly admitting his religion, Zafaru'llah Khan gave credence to the charge made by the Ahrar that the government was "controlled" by the Ahmadis. For the other Islamic groups and the ulama, who viewed the Ahmadis with opporobrium, the very presence of an Ahmadi minister in the cabinet was proof of the un-Islamicity of the state. The Ahrar and the ulama, infuriated by the foreign minister's actions, organized a protest march; the marchers clashed with the Ahmadis, and there was a riot.</p>
<p>- S.V.R. Nasr. <em>The Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution: The Jama'at-i Islami of Pakistan</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994): 133</p></blockquote>
<p>Nasr does note, elsewhere, the fact that these so-called Muslim parties were adamantly opposed to Pakistan before 1947 and unironically segued into becoming the sole representatives of Muslims after 1949. (( But, I do find the underlying tone of that whole paragraph by Nasr highly objectionable - this insinuation that Zafarullah Khan should have kept quiet or that "Ahmadis themselves set off the conflict". Bad, bad, bad work, Nasr. )) </p>
<p>That Zafarullah Khan's memory has been so thoroughly erased from everyday lives - where theorists often prattle on and on about the long memories of the nation-state, such intense and immediate silencings are rarely noted - is indicative of the changed narrative about Ahmadis in Pakistan - who are now simply heretics and infidels to be eliminated indiscriminately. </p>

<p>Here is another erasure on the tombstone of Dr. Abdus Salam. Look at that word Muslim scraped clean by some industrious employee of the state. I have <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/dr_abdus_salam.html">written previously about Abdus Salam </a> but I didn't mention his Ahmadiyat - just that he was considered an outcast. That was another erasure.</p>
