  content: Actually I popped in to see what you had said about Woolmer.   Even with
    that stunningly bad pun in the headline, please comment.  An inquiring mind wants
    to know.

<p>As part of the Year End Clearance&Acirc;&reg;, below are posts that I started at some point in last year, never finished, and will never finish. I would like them to stop haunting my Write tab - so I am deleting these half-finished, half-started thoughts and giving them a public burial. Below are the dates, topic and reasons-why-I-never-finished-writing-them for all the posts. </p>
<p>Dedicated to <a href="http://www.gotim.be/art/Buckinx/">Boudewijn Buckinx</a>:</p>
<p>1.<br />
Title: No Woolmer No Cry<br />
Date Started: March 29, 2007<br />
Topic: Bob Woolmer's murder.<br />
Reason: No Comment.</p>
<p>2.<br />
Title: Hima<br />
Date Started: March 26, 2007<br />
Topic: Review of the documentary, Hima: The Life and Times of a Lady from Awadh<br />
Reason: I got too busy. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Title: With Apologies to Our Colonial Father: A Letter from Post-National Pakistan<br />
Date Started: March 23, 2007<br />
Topic: It was going to be one of those Orwell tricks of writing from the future about the present in the guise of speaking about the past.<br />
Reason: You know what cures hangovers? A great breakfast at Valois.</p>
<p>4.<br />
Title: Joy<br />
Date Started: Feb 8, 2007<br />
Topic: Some youtube clip.<br />
Reason: I came to my senses. YouTube clips can only be inflicted on the dearest of friends - and then, only in emails.</p>
<p>5.<br />
Title: Dirt and Fire<br />
Date Started: Dec 22, 2006<br />
Topic: An Urdu <a href="http://nawaiwaqt.com.pk/urdu/daily/mar-2007/18/idarati1.php">column</a> I wanted to translate.<br />
Reason: It was just all too much - unpacking, uncoding and explaining the translation. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Title: Outram<br />
Date Started: Nov 1, 2006<br />
Topic: "Sir James Outram has the honor of having the first Equestrian statue in India." Now, this would have made a good post. It had pictures. And historical details. And I had just written a paper on Outram.<br />
Reason: I had just written a paper on Outram.</p>
<p>7.<br />
Title: Teaching Postcoloniality<br />
Date Started: Oct 8, 2006<br />
Topic: A Roundtable I attended.<br />
Reason: Hard to say, but I think mostly because I am _still_chewing it over.</p>
<p>8.<br />
Title: Cricket, Interrupted.<br />
Date Started: Aug 25, 2006<br />
Topic: The abandoned Oval test and its echoes back into our colonial pasts.<br />
Reason: This became a more personal post than I had intended - which made me stop writing. And then life interrupted.</p>
<p>9.<br />
Title: The Outsider<br />
Date Started: Jun 27, 2006<br />
Topic: William Moorcroft  (d. 1825) and his horse-trading, spying, adventuring ways across Afghanistan and Western Iran.<br />
Reason: This ended up being an email send out to my Orientalist friends.</p>
