    Amazing!

    Geo's website claims he is "MBBS PhD". His BA, MA, PhD have turned out to be fake. What about his MBBS?

    Zack: Here is his bio that I could find:
    <blockquote>Born on July 5th, 1971 in Karachi, Dr. Aamer Liaquat Hussain belongs to a family that has been prominent in politics. He studied medicine at the University of Sindh and while still a student excelled in debates, journalism, broadcasting & campus politics. It was during his university days that Dr. Aamir Liaquat became an icon of the debating fraternity winning the &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;Best Debator of Asia&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; award bestowed by the International Youth Congress, United Nations. In addition he was declared &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;Best Debator of Pakistan&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; (Eight Times), Sindh (Thrice) & Karachi, (17 times).</blockquote>

    The <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/faculties.html" rel="nofollow">website</a> of the University of Sindh does not list any School of Medicine. Nor can I find any International Youth Congress.

  content: Ask me how I am feeling? I am feeling betrayed. I campaigned for him during
    elections and had chance to listen and meet him many times. I never paid attention
    on his degrees during all this time. It never occured to me for a moment that
    he could be just as fake as mulla party.

    Hooray! I can't stand that guy and his ridiculously coloured sherwanis and suits. To be fair, I think it was significant that he had shia and sunni scholars sitting side by side each week. But it was somehow too fake. "Aaye, hum telephone call ki taraf jaate hain, aur suntay, sochtay, samajhtay hain"

    But mind you, "Alim Online" looks great when compared to a similar show on ARY Digital called "Istikhara Online". On that show people call in and tell them about their problems (usually about their spouse or mother in law) and have a maulvi do istikhara. It's amazing.

  content: Okay, don't kill me--but who gives a crap if his degrees are fake  if--and
    I mean if, because I don't know jack about him--if he's saying things that need
    to be said? Like many of you, I am overeducated (legimitately) and underemployed.
    One of the few indisputably valuable things I got from my education was the knowledge
    that everyone (especially some of my knucklehead profs) was, at some level, faking
    it. Life has called much of my "education" into question, but that realization
    has never even budged. Sorry. Don't hate. Running for cover...

    I love this blurb about accredation the Trinity College <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/accreditation.html" rel="nofollow">page</a>:

    "At Trinity, we believe that by having an Accreditation Association, the Correspondence Accreditation Association (CAA), the awards are stimulated, strengthened and substantiated. So we formed the association, the Correspondence Accreditation Association, which will confirm your awards to any enquirer. Upon written request, we confirm the degree awarded, its date and subject, this is normally all that is required from any inquirer."

    There's also a comment on <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/ethical.html" rel="nofollow">ethics</a>.

  content: Interesting stuff. One doesn't need a plethora of degrees to be classified
    as "intelligent" even by Geo's standards. To masquerade as an intellectual by
    having a series of false/dubious degrees is another matter altogether. What this
    does touch upon is another more serious matter. What does it take to become an
    alim ? There is quite simply, no system of accreditation. During the classical
    age of Islam, scholars went through some pretty gruelling training. The fruit
    of their scholarship is available centuries later. But what about modern ulama
    ? I know there is a recognised (by the state) curriculum (dars) that operates
    at the madrassah level. If today's output is anything to go on, this is sadly
    lacking.

    And another one bites the dust.  I just wish someone would have the patience and the energy to comb through the "degrees" of all our parliamentarians, not for the sake of actively ousting any one in particular, but just because sometimes, the truth is important.

    Alim(jahil) online Amir's Geo tv program is missleading lots of people especialy women giving lots of wrong information about islam by so called Alims.
    the very wrong thing Amir is said is "apna iman choro mat dosre ka iman charo mat"
    if this is so why YOU are running this program.
    why Allah has send lots of prophets to change people's faith(iman).
    if this is so then why we muslim do "tabligh".

    A muslim do not have his own faith a muslim always follows Prophet Muhammed's(saww) faith.

    We must not blame Dr.Amir Liaqat Hussain. Because he is our representative and is representing our national character which almost base on engineered half truths. What the other politicians have done to Pakistan! misery, illiteracy, diseases, slums with 38 billion dollars debt! Still Benazir and Nawaz claim loyality to the nation and to the country! What the military buraeucracy has done for Pakistan since its creation; repeated interventions, breaking of constitutions, watching  attacks on sacred building (only) of supreme court? What the civil buraucracy  (CSP/PCS) have contributed , building their own castles at the graves of tax payer nation and polluting / planning the departments of vital and technical nature for which they have no degrees and formal education?

    In these circumstances , we must appreciate Dr.Amir Liaqat Hussain as he has conducted several pogrammes wherein he has tried to build up concensus on releigious issues, irrespective of his degrees.

    Is there any body who may put him jail if his degrees are fake? Investigate many other cases and put them to the task?
    Is there anybody who may assure that deaths of Quaid-e-Azam, Fatima Jinnah, ZA Bhutto, Ziaul Haq, Asif Nawaz janujua were not engineered?
    Is there anybody who may suure that Dr.Qadeer Khan cant hide and lift heavy instruements in his pocket or at his shoulders?
    Is there anybody who may ensure people of Waziristan and Baluchistan that our forces are innocent like Capitan Hamad and are peace loving with national spirit?
    Is there anybody who may identify the Muslim league which actually built pakistan (Muslim League A,B,C,...J,N,Q...Z, Aa, Ab...)? and may differentiate loyal and oppertunist members of the wholy Muslim League? Is there any body who may save Pakistan from CSPs and PCS officers who are still dreaming for Lordships and are working against the noble and sincere (in true meaning)agenda of General Parvez Musharraf? by not pro-actively cooperating with the local governments.( Even then  the  performance of devolution system is better than the notorius DC system)

    If one can do so, then he has right to hang Dr. Amir Liaqat Hussain not for fake degrees but for telling the first lie in the  histroy of Pakistan?

  content: Trininity college and Universit a is a sacred and recognised institution
    at Spain, Dover as well as in some other parts of the world. Dr.Amir should tell
    the pople with confidence as he secured degrees from that institution base on
    his experience. Can anybody having a formal Ph.D degree compete him in Islamic
    Knowledge? Never. Mr. Amir has right to enjoy rank of Dr. because of the knowledge,
    certified by the Trinity.

  content: I won't say that i had a vague idea that this guy was fake, but the way
    he was humiliating islam was pathetic. The way he used to cry on the 27th of Ramadan
    with crocodile tears was ridiculous. Last but not the least, preaching to be the
    follower of Prophet Muhammad S.A.W and not getting tired of reciting naats in
    the praise of the Prophet, he could not dare grow a beard which is one of the
    most authentic symbol of muslims. He came up with a silly explanation that Sikhs
    and Jews have beards too, why should we have it, I wonder what would have Hazrat
    Umer said to him at a query against the principles set by the Prophet S.A.W. I
    just watched 2 or 3 of his programs, i shuddered at the thought that even people
    with the weakest faith don't dare challenge the principles of islam, and this
    guy did it without any hesitation. May ALLAH guide us all on the right path and
    may ALLAH deface anyone who tries to mess up our beloved religion.

    first of all even if he had fake degrees he does not present himself as an Alim in the program, he is just sitting there as a host.

    there is to be more investigation from different sources if this is true.

    and secondly, he may have many opponents spreading false allegations against him. if he tries to cope with the problem of child exploitation, this could be one reason. i personally know lot of cases in Pakistan relating to child exploitation in some mosques of villages.

  content: "what geo says about the following factual article\nhe does not have Islamic
    knowledge except he is a good singer which the president likes. Dr. Fake\nPosted
    on Thursday 10 March 2005 \n  I am sure you all must know of our famous MNA
    cum TV personality Dr. Aamir Liaqat Hussain. For the past few months rumors have
    been circulating that he is a fake doctor finally I have evidence. In a detailed
    investigation conducted by a local newspaper &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;Ummat&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;
    and recently published in South Asia Tribune, some really interesting fact have
    indeed come forth surely worth a NAB &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;chappa&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;.
    \nDr. Aamir appears to be one of the biggest local scams of Pakistan. For the
    past couple years he has been the host of &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;Aalim
    Online&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;
    on Geo TV where he brings together Islamic Scholars to shed light on the religion
    of Islam. I have always disliked watching the show as it always appeared as a
    scam, a snazzy looking Dr. Aamir preaching Islam some how irritated me, but that&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s
    just me, I have for sometime labeled his show as Jahil Online. It now appears
    to be entirely true. Dr. Aamir had been preaching Islam with such authority that
    it had the nation fooled for years including our General who has appointed him
    as a Minister of Religious Affairs (probably in a deal with MQM)\nHe has graduated
    from &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;Trinity
    College and University&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;
    with a Bachelors of Arts in Islamic Studies (conferred on March 17, 1995). The
    next degree that he allegedly pursued was a Masters of Arts in Islamic Studies
    (conferred on March 15, 2002) and amazingly 20 days later was awarded a doctorate,
    Doctor of Philosophy in Islamic Studies (conferred on April 5, 2002). All these
    degrees were awarded by Trinity College based out of Spain. The going rate for
    these &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;degrees
    by mail&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;
    as published on the Trinity College website (link) is\nBachelors = $ 212\nMasters
    = $ 332\nDoctorate= $ 500\nOr a one time deal all three degrees for a bumper price
    of $ 850  Trinity College on its webpage claims the following slogans \"providing
    degrees based on your previous life\" and the best slogan \"No Residency or Attendance
    is required in Spain Everything by Mail\" \nDr. (Fake) Aamir Liaquat Hussain contested
    the National Assembly elections based on these degrees and successfully won, he
    stands to be disqualified for providing fake degrees to support his candidacy
    (which as you all recall was strictly limited to graduates). The Higher Education
    Commission Pakistan has also declare in a letter that Trinity College is not a
    authorized degree awarding university. How can it be since its just one of those
    online stores that awards these degrees. Check these pictures out as they sure
    are incriminating evidence.\nCopy of his Bachelors of Arts in Islamic Studies

    Trinity College Website \nI leave you with considerable evidence, for you to decide\nUpdate
    13th March: In a Google search of our fake Aalim I came across this interview
    from Daily Times \nDaily Times: What are your predictions about the Pakistani
    politics?\nAamir Liaqat: I am really disappointed with the Pakistani politics.
    The biggest despondency is the involvement of Maulvis in the mainstream politics,
    who are raising local issues at national levels. I am not hopeful with the national
    politics. The politicians of my country fight only for their own interests. I
    request General Musharraf to give me a chartered plane, and I would take all the
    politicians to Iraq. Then I would ask all those who claim to be great Muslims
    to come out and fight against the anti-Islam forces. If I could not take the airplane
    to Iraq, then I will destroy it in the sea. I would sacrifice my own life for
    this noble cause.\nI am foreseeing a bloody revolution. Sorry to say, the democracy
    would bring nothing better in this country. Pakistan needs a bloody revolution.
    A person is required here, who will eliminate all the politicians once for all,
    and then intelligent and young people of Pakistan will come forward to lead the
    nation. I fear that in revolution the geographical situation might also change.

    fake degrees is a growing concern for all nations. It simply leaves the people
    useless, who put in their heart and soul in the 4+ years at univ. There should
    be an international body that recognizes a particular standard for all degrees.

    I love this blog, but the people who read it - instead of being educated, tolerant, and universal Muslims - are sadly, ignorant bigoted and zealous.

    I would love to see the jerks ass maulvis from Jamaat E Islami and Sipah Sabah go to Iraq and help their Muslim "brothers".  If all Muslims were indeed "brothers", then the Palestine issue would have been resolved a century ago.  Also in Pakistan, we have been to influenced by the Hindu Bahmins who have incorporated this caste-system into our very own psyches.  In Islam, we are all equal - yet this principle is not adopted when we marry each other in Pakistan.  Jats marry into Jats, Rajputs marry Rajputs, Syeds marry Syeds, Yousufzahi marry Yousufzahi, Rohilla marry Rohilla etc. And every one thinks they are superior to the other.  A sad bloody situation.

    Those who are giving Amir liaqat ali a margin of doubt , they can just google. The will find that the university boasts to grant PhDs instatntly. And they invoke you to give the credit card number NOW. And you get the degree in 15 days. BTW why would somebody pay 500 $ for a piece of (perhaps , at most well designed) paper. You can just print one for yourself using Microsoft Office I think.
    BTW I have another example of this kind. The Assistant Registrar of PU ( a young lad) claims to win a huge number of awards and stuff. And the one which he is most proud of is Genious of South Asia, which he has won two times. Ofcourse nothing like that exists. He actually recieved two medals from PU just as an aknowledgment of winning the prestigous Genious of South Asia award. He claims to have won many other such (existant only in his fantacy awards) and he not only gets away with all that crap, he actually is rewarded for coming up with such genious even by parvez musharraf himself.

    What on earth does he mean?  (I am genuinely perplexed-- what is the geographical "situation"?  And am I the only one to notice that the host of alim online looks a lot like the guy who played the villain ("Roshi Mahanta") in "Khalnayak"?

    we are the most fickle nation.  We are never happy with anyone person for too
    long -- we never look at all the positive things one leader or person has done
    -- always focused on negative.  Our nation should concentrate on getting knowlegde
    and education-- be informed then and only can we differentiate between frauds
    or otherwise.  As far as I am concerned Dr. Liaqat - irrelevant whether he has
    degrees or not- has brought up some eye opening issues in our society that most
    would rather not hear about or would turn a blind eye to.  Good for him and I
    pray that more people would open their and bring the injustices to the surface
    so the people can be made aware and their eyes opened and maybe we will learn
    to deal with them instead of sweeping them under the rug.

    Dear Brothers Salam Walekum wrbth!



    This is really offending to read such things about Dr Aamir on net. We all learn with time&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; how come we can deny this fact that corrupt people become righteous. It depends upon upon  for what good actions of yours he (Allah) gives hidaya. Dr Aamir's contributions are praiseworthy. If you donot subscribe to his school of thought u have freedom to do that&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;so many sects are there in Islam. Hadith says there will be 73 and one will be right. Very difficult to say who is right?  Don't tell anything wrong abt any jamat or even religions otherwise they will tell same for you&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;Quran forbids to do that. However Dr Aamir's dress or his style of presentaion is concerned. This is not so important. Mashallah, now he is having beard and it will grow more also in few years. What is surity that if you have balishtful beard, your Iman is secured, it is yr act, deeds, behaviors, concerns, motives, objectives and goals which detrmines yr suceess as a true muslim. In reciting quran, nats or hamds what is bad? Dr Aamir has enough credential to show that he is a good presenter, his achievment is praiseworthy. Regarding his dress, people criticize...he doesn't offend you by not adhering to SATAR, his choice of color and design is highly a personal things. If you don't like, you have evry right to not wear such dress and such color. Islam is a religion of moderation and not extremes. The age of today requires such people who can guide you being forthright. He subscribes to Hanafi maslak and ahle sunna, good enough. Don't go into matters which brings divide&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;quran warns for that. Dr Aamir sucess is huge by bringing people of conflicting views on a similar desk and establishing consensus to some extent in ceratin matter. This is surely helping to remove the gulf between shias and sunni community. His contribution is magnificient. What you want&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; to go in mosque during Ramadhan and kill sunni if u r shia and to kill shias if u r sunni. Allah says if u kill a single person for none of his harm, it is like killing the whole humanity. It is not warranted to agree with all what Dr Aamir is saying,  if u don't agree  use words which are parliamentarian and be logical in your comments. Wassalm! Allah knows the best.

  content: "Wailikumassalam Ghouri Sahab, bilkul sahih farmaya aap nay. Aaj ki
    muslim duniya ka sab say bara fitna na America hai aur na hi nuclear bombs. Sab
    say bara fitna hai \"mullah\". Specially Pakistani Mullah. They have separated
    the muslims by dividing the islam in to many sects and now they are struggling
    to start a fight or say \"war\" in which muslims are killing and fighiting with
    other muslims. The best application of British philosophy \"divide and rule\",
    u can see here in Pakistan in our mosques. They have divide the muslims apart
    and now each mullah has become the king of his own mosque, in which he rules over
    a huge no. of his so called followers. Lal Masjid is the best example nowadays. Every
    mullah declares the follower of other sects as \"kafir\" and hence it becomes
    not only easy but a matter of pride and an opportunity to earn \"sawaab\" to his
    follower to kill each and every member of opposite sects which according to them
    are now 'kafirs'. Thats how things are running in Pakistan. But still, besides
    coping with such big and important issues, we are focusing more on non-issues
    like Amir Liaquat's degree, wether it makes a difference or not."

    Barelvi, Ahl-e-sunnat Aljamaat, Ahle sunnat, Ahle Hadeeth or whatever with his
    name). Is there even a single maulana who would agree that he is just a muslim
    and deosnot belong to any sect or school of religious thoughts. [And you know
    that all the sects comprehends (only and only)themselves as a true sect (based
    on a Hadeeth of Prophet Peace Be Upon Him), so what abt the rest? Arent they \"non-follower\"
    or \"false Sects\" or just 'kafir' in more simpler terms.] If this is true,
    and there is really a \"just muslim\" maulana exist, then I will admit that I
    have really committed a serious sin by blaming and humiliating a religious scholar
    and I will seek pardon and forgiveness from Allah. Wassalam."

    really don't care where someone got there degree from, as long as they can live
    upto the expectations of the title.  Alim online presents Islam in a very open
    fashion, that some might find offensive, and some might not.  I personally like
    his style, it is better then some fanatic preaching hate.  Islam is the religion
    of love and tolerance, and he presents in that matter.  That is what I find very
    attractive.  If you think you can do better, then please step up, and don't complain,
    go do it.  If you want to cast a stone, then let those who have not sinned cast
    the first stone.

  content: "Assalam Alaikum, I've read through few responses on this thread and
    believe it or not..It hurts to see so many people tearing upon unnecessary details
    that may or may not be true. It is not difficult to see Dr. Liaqat's dedication
    to an incredible cause, and his integrity through his efforts. People have a right
    to their opinions, but no one reserves the right to degrade anyone based on empty
    accusations. What should be quite evident, is that no one so far has had the courage
    to put so many views on the same platform for us muslims to judge and scrutinize.
    No one so far has demonstrated what it means to be capture charisma, intellect,
    and leadership altogether. Putting aside our own biases, its hard to deny that
    Dr. Liaqat has already made a significant contribution to our nation, and has
    the potential to offer much much more. Time has proven many time that those who
    have the guts to voice the most controversial issues of society often become targets
    of controversy and scrutiny. We as ordinary people do not have the means to judge
    the legitimacy of anyone's degrees and qualifications, but we do have the sanity
    to judge a person's integrity and dedication through his words and actions. I
    cannot deny influence of Dr. Liaqat's thought provoking words on my life, nor
    can I deny the influence of his charisma. I would genuinely urge everyone to please
    put aside your biases and empty beliefs, and for once appreciate his efforts to
    bring the Muslims together under one umbrella and take one good look at themselves.
    Even if you won't agree with him, you'll walk out with the ambition to learn something
    new.  Wsalam"

<p><img src="/img/aalim_online.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6/>Imagine a young, vibrant, clean-cut scholar of Islam who starts a tv show <a href="http://www.geo.tv/geotv/program.asp?pid=113">Aalim Online</a> for GeoTV in Pakistan. On this program, he invites Shi'a and Sunni clerics and Christians and Hindus and Parsis and takes on controversial topics head-on. He even tackles suicide bombings and earns praise from The General himself. Imagine that being popular brings its share of <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/t45293.html">naysayers</a>. But the young reformist presses on. Imagine that besides being a popular tv personality, he is also the state minister for Religious Affairs. Imagine his defiance of the Orthodox hardliners, right in the senate. Imagine him <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/dec2004-daily/09-12-2004/main/main6.htm">challenging</a> the stodgy, lecherous old MMA-wallas for not stopping sexual exploitation of young boys in the decadent madrasas; leading the MMA-walla to "use unparliamentary language against the minister". Ladies and Gentlemen, our collective imaginations have created a veritable superhero of moderate Islam!</p>
<p>And what enables our imaginary hero to leap over Islam and democracy in one single bound? What is the source of his power? His three-piece suits? No. His clean-shaven face? No. It must be his Ph.D. in Islamic Studies with a thesis on "Islam and Terrorism"! It is that which allows him to face with authority the bearded messengers of doom and gloom. It allows him to negotiate truth from heresy and assert the moderation and open-ness of Islam. It is the Ph.D. that he earned from <a href="http://www.trinityeducation.com/">Trinity College of USA, Spain</a>. Alas, our superhero has a supervillian. Google. Intrepid reporters from one pissed-off MMA-walla newspaper, <a href="http://ummat.com.pk/">Ummat</a>, googled our scholar and found that he <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.php?id=96981">purchased</a> his BA, MA and PhDs in Islamic Studies over the web, then strong-armed the chancellor of Karachi University to approve them as accredited degrees so that he could run for election in 2002. Our imaginary superhero has imaginary degrees. Meet Dr. Amir Liaquat Hussain, Parlimentarian of MQM, Member of National Assembly of Pakistan, NA 249, Host of Aalim Online.</p>
<p>There goes Enlightened Moderation. But, the saga is far from over. <i>Everyone</i> in the National Assembly of Pakistan has an imaginery degree.  Our superhero will fight back. He will triumph. Islam must be saved from the MMA-wallas!</p>
<p><b>update:</b> In response to Zack's query, I googled a bit more and found this amazing <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_24-3-2003_pg7_31">quote</a>:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">DT: What are your predictions about the Pakistani politics?</p>
<p>AL: I am really disappointed with the Pakistani politics. The biggest despondency is the involvement of Maulvis in the mainstream politics, who are raising local issues at national levels. I am not hopeful with the national politics. The politicians of my country fight only for their own interests. I request General Musharraf to give me a chartered plane, and I would take all the politicians to Iraq. Then I would ask all those who claim to be great Muslims to come out and fight against the anti-Islam forces. If I could not take the airplane to Iraq, then I will destroy it in the sea. I would sacrifice my own life for this noble cause. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am foreseeing a bloody revolution. Sorry to say, the democracy would bring nothing better in this country. Pakistan needs a bloody revolution. A person is required here, who will eliminate all the politicians once for all, and then intelligent and young people of Pakistan will come forward to lead the nation. I fear that in revolution the geographical situation might also change.</p></div>
<p>Wow.</p>
