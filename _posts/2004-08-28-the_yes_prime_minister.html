    Shaukat Aziz has done a decent job with the economy, but his role has been exaggerated. I think that <a href="http://www.sbp.org.pk/about/governors/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ishrat Husain</a> at the <a href="http://www.sbp.org.pk/" rel="nofollow">State Bank</a> has probably had a large hand to play in the economy's revival.

    But if we dig a little deeper, it does seem that the revival is mostly on paper and has affected only those businessmen at the top. The masses still feel quite separated from the revival: high unemployment, expensive gasoline, little access to quality education. And I don't they have the patience to wait for the supposed "trickle down" effect. Sounds alot like the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3756387.stm" rel="nofollow">"India Shining"</a> claim that was being made across the border. It become's easy to understand why this is the case when we take note that Shaukat Aziz has a background in banking and finance, not in running a country (compare with Dr. Manmohan Singh's background).

    One thing that Shaukat Aziz has on his side though is that he is generally viewed as an clean honest person, separate from the mudslinging of most Pakistani politicians. But I guess that will change as he enters the political arena. Best of luck!

    Sepoy,

    I think running a country and running the treasury are two different ball games. Aziz has been a capable finance minister and his elevation to PM is the least bad option. Yet, given his total lack of popular support, it is difficult to see that his appointment will do anything to assure political stability in Pakistan. He can stay PM as long as the General stays as President (and army chief).

  content: "Dear Sepoy,  You wrote \"...in protest, ARD, MQM, MMA, PPP all walked
    out\" I would like to make a correction here that MQM did not walk out and they
    voted for Shokat Aziz. In fact, Farooq Sattar, MQM's parlimantry leader was in
    London and he rushed back to Islamabad just to cast his vote for Shokat. Unfortunately
    Mr. Sattar didnt arrive on time so he asked Speaker of the assembly to make an
    special announcement about his vote which he decided to use for Shokat."

  content: MQM will definately support Shaukat Aziz as they are in Govt. and our General
    knows best how to drive this Mahajirs around.(Altaf loves Mussarraf). the question
    is not about being a finance minister or the prime minister , its about saving
    pakistan and actually putting it onto developement tracks. Remember Moeen Qureshi..July-Sept.1993...a
    renowned World Bank Economist...what did he gave us?? He handed Pk over to IMF
    and uptil now we are in debt.He literally destroyed Pk...so we want to repeat
    the history?? I dont think so..Shaukat Aziz is there for some other BIG game,
    we dont know yet , but  it will soon surface...

  content: "Dear Sir/madam, Democracy as a system of governance and interest representation
    demands respect for dissent and opposition. It recognizes the principle of
    majority rule and guarantees, protection of minorities. Democracy also builds
    faith in electoral contestation to gain public office and gives legitimacy to
    political parties as primary instruments for acquisition and transfer of power
    from one set of individuals to another, however the internal blame culture is
    to promote the possible benefit for the concerned party only it has no concern
    with the right of deprived people of Pakistan.    Since the creation of
    Pakistan the Pakistani people are left at distant from the corridor of power,
    so that the ruling elite can do what they wanted to do in favor of their interest,
    leaving the Pakistani people at the mercy of circumstances. As this policy is
    denial of right of Pakistani people to rule their country according to their aspiration
    and desire to built this country, which can provide equal opportunity to all without
    any discrimination for the establishment of welfare society. Instead the people
    were divided in to muhajir, Sindhi, Punjabi, pukhtun and Baloch. Only the society
    base on tolerance, equality and justice can be the real guarantee for the prosperous
    and strong Pakistan there for your intention is invited to the crucial movement
    which could be the point of distraction or disaster. Many innocent people are
    dying every day-week and every month. Because of bombast, suicide attacks and
    target killing in Pakistan the factual condition is that nothing happened in this
    world without any reason, the need of the time is to redress the grievances of
    the people and eliminate the reason.  The right way to reverence to Martyr
    is to eliminate the causes after the incidents. If we can redress the route cause
    after the suicide killing, we can save many lives in future. The only way out
    is the change of system the route cause of all kind of grievances, the time is
    \ to empower the Pakistani at grass route level to eliminate the socio-political
    injustice and strengthen the unity within the society at large, and closing the
    door for outsiders or intruder to penetrate in our society because of social unrest.  Unfortunately,
    despite the significance of the democratic elements, only the power full elite
    are fitted in power and Pakistani are always left at the mercy of circumstances
    again and again... As this policy is denial of right of Pakistani people to rule
    their country according to their aspiration and desire to built this country,
    which can provide equal opportunity to all without any discrimination for the
    establishment of welfare society. Only the society based on tolerance, equality
    and justice can be the real guarantee for real peace and progress in the society.
    Therefore, Change of socio-political system is inevitable to empower the Pakistani
    at grass route level for rapid industrial and agriculture development.  See

<p><img src="/img/aziz2.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Shaukat Aziz is now PM of Pakistan. He was <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2004/08/28/top1.htm">elected</a> to the post at a National Assembly session with 191 votes and no opposition. Which is funny, because, for once in Pakistani history there was the most unified opposition candidate, <a href="http://javed-hashmi-news.newslib.com/">Javed Hashmi</a>, a man incarcerated by the General for "sedition". However, Hashmi was not allowed to attend the Assembly and, in protest, ARD, <s>MQM</s>, MMA, PPP all walked out. Really. The opposition against the General just got united which, I must say, is bad news.<br />
But, anyways, back to Aziz. Here is the <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3136376">Economist's</a> take on the dismal state of affairs facing the new PM. In his acceptance speech, he vowed to work with the opposition and to run an open and transparent government. I have said earlier that I am very ambivalent about Aziz. On the one hand, there is no hope for Pakistan if the General does not retire and democracy does not return. On the other hand, I am impressed with the numbers game that Aziz has played as Finance Minister - Pakistan's economy is coming along well (uh, the massive US aid helps a bit. just a bit.)<br />
Aziz faces immense challenges, chief among them is that the General can flip anytime; also, the mullahs are getting out of control; also, Baluchistan is hurtling towards chaos; also, Osama may be found somewhere in Rawalpindi leading US to drop Pakistan like its 1989 ; also, Osama may never be found leading US to continue propping up the General; also, the economy has yet to establish a solid base; also, oh heck.<br />
On the plus side, Aziz has proven himself as a bureaucrat (or technocrat, as the homi press calls him). And he is, uh, close to Paul Wolfowitz. Question is whether he can be the perfect rubber-stamp that the General desires? After all, that is the only qualification for the job.</p>
