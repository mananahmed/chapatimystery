<p><a href='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/02/not_naked_obama.jpeg' title='Fully Clothed Obama'><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/02/not_naked_obama.thumbnail.jpeg' alt='Fully Clothed Obama' /></a>While CM was being hacked, some of your correspondents ended up getting hijacked by the trendiest new web presence in town, <a href="http://my.barackobama.com">my.barackobama.com</a>.  Within moments of the site's inception, we began to feverishly collect friends, join groups and start movements.  But now that the site is already five days old, the bloom has faded from the rose and we are ready to come home.  We are not sure if, after all, we wish to be part of a nationwide email conversation about how much, how very very much, we want our guy to kick the cig habit, or how it might be fun to have a ginormous sixty minute conference call with fellow supporters <em>across the nation</em>.  </p>
<p>We still love the man, and it being Valentine's Day, we're here to express that, despite concerns about his handling of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/an_open_letter_to_senator_barack_obama.html">the whole madrassa issue</a>, and other worries yet to be discovered. So in honor of his dignity, which is being vigorously shredded from all sides, we've gone photoshopping for a pretty new t-shirt to help him cover his nakedness, since <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=18&entry_id=13485">he is still apparently somewhat miffed</a> about the People mag papparazzo shot. As in the sad tale of the toothsome Gavin Newsom, who learned too late, after being caught with his pants figuratively down, that all those hair gel articles recalled a simpler, happier time, the Obamalator needs to understand that he should count himself lucky when he has only been exposed <em>literally</em>.</p>
