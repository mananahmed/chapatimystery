  content: I am a great admirer of Anarkali  who was in love with prince selim(later
    emperor jehangir),there is a tomb of her in lahore but sad to say it is not given
    much importance as a monument of love.In india we give top importance to Taj mahal
    as a monument of love .In Italy they give importance to the city of verona as
    a destination for tourists because romeo and juliet lived there.The tomb of anarkali
    can be promoted as a tourist destination /as a monument of love  and i am sure
    it will slowly but surely attract tourists and will generate income for local
    people and government.

    I have a firm called ANARKALY SERVI&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&acute;OS DE L&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&macr;NGUAS (meaning language services)in Mozambique.
    I decided to have this name as a tribute to THE OTHER the tale of Anarkali in fact represents.
    Would that be possible to us to get some material from the oral tradition or/ and even some posters or drawings that could call the attention to it?
    Where to find it?

  content: "something i wrote after actually visiting anarkalai's tomb -\n\nI look
    up at the massive whitewashed dome of Anarkali&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    Tomb looming against the Lahore sky in awe. I was expecting something much smaller,
    far less grand. She was after all a &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&acute;fallen&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;
    woman. According to popular belief a courtesan, probably a member of Akbar&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    harem, bricked into a wall for daring to love the emperor&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    son. In the 19th century, this was the residence of General Ventura, the French
    commander of Ranjit Singh&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s army; after
    the British took over, for a short while it was an Anglican church. Today the
    tomb stands in the compound of the Punjab Civil Secretariat.\n\nThe guard is apologetic
    about not letting me in. The tomb now houses the Punjab State Archives, and even
    researchers can enter for only an hour a day. But he shows me a window on the
    side, from where I can look at Anarkali&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s
    mazaar. The tombstone has been shifted next to the wall, and through the window
    you can see beautiful Persian calligraphy, which apparently reads: &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;Ah!
    For just one more glimpse of my beloved, I shall thank God till the day of resurrection.&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger;
    Signed, &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;The enamoured Salim, son of Akbar.&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger;
    \n\nA tomb sacred to the memory of a courtesan, where a mercenary firangi once
    lived, now houses the documentary past of an entire province. I think I will like
    Lahore..."

    well salim was a lousy person who cudnt stand up for his love ...n in end the its the womam who suffered due to his dumbness/weakness.....not worth loving for.
    so Anarkali is a story of a coward's love to just antoher paly of heart...if salim truly wud have loved her he wudnt have marreid Noor jehan..who was wife of sher afghan,murdered at orders of Salim aka jehangir...so as to win Noor jehan.
    damn that moghul!

  content: I'm brought up in Delhi so, frequently visited Agra on every vacation.
    Everytime I was surprised to see the tunnel door at Fatehpur Sikri which is said
    to be used by Anarkali to escape to Lahore as told by the guide. As we all know
    our history, I mean the subcontinent, is more based on folk lore than facts, can
    you guide me through this? Moreover, Just few days ago while researching on the
    Mughal, I read an article where the writer says Anarkali or the Nadira Begum was
    an important member of Akbar's court in Lahore and very important indeed which
    was often opposed by Salim himself. Anarkali died during Akbar's regime and if
    she was so much been hated why Akbar would he even allow anyone to make the massive
    tomb for her? Please help me.And if possible can you send a pic. of Anarkali's
    tomb at my email id. Thanks.

    much larger army and quickly defeated Prince Saleem's force. Akbar gave Saleem
    two choices,either to surrender Anarkali to him or to face the death penalty.Prince

    the unconscious Saleem could not do anything not to sandwich Anarkali alive."

<p><img src="/images/anarkali.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Every single trip I took to Old Anarkali bazaar in Lahore as a youth had one hidden motive: Try to guess which wall is Anarkali, the nautch-girl who dared love the Emperor's son, cemented in. I used to think she was still alive and peeking through little holes in the wall, observing the world. A bit morbid, I must admit. </p>
<p>The legend of the love between Prince Salim (later to become Emperor Jahangir (c. 1605-26)) and a commoner Anarkali must have some roots in folklore but I am a bit lazy to dig it up right now. The story goes as follows: The prince and the girl fall in love. Emperor Akbar deems the romance against the royal wishes. The prince rebels and is sentenced to death. Anarkali steps forward and says that she will sacrifice her life instead but to spend one night with her lover. They have that one night. In the morning, the palace guards take her away and she is sandwiched alive in a brick wall. </p>
<p>This tale was told in the 1922 Urdu play, <i>Anarkali</i> written by  <a href="http://www.pakpost.gov.pk/philately/stamps2001/dr_imtiaz_ali_taj.html">Syed Imitiaz Ali Taj</a>. Taj was a good ole' Lahori boy who was very much into the seedy life-style of <i>mujaras</i> that took place around the old gates of Lahore. He sought to capture for eternity one of those nautch-girls and I doubt it existed before that. Several film versions followed but the most famous was the Indian epic <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/2002_12/review03_mughal.html">Mughal-e Azam</a> (1960). I watched it as a child and must have been where I got fixated on Anarkali's final resting place (there is a tomb of Anarkali in the bazaar, though).</p>
<p>Anyways, all that is relevant today because Field-Marshall-to-be is coming to NY on September 22 and part of his shindig is to attend a <a href="http://www.despardes.com/pakistan/ent/jul04/3.html">special screening</a> on Broadway of <i>Anarkali</i>. The high-entry fee play is to benefit the UN Human Development Fund. Zia Mohiyudin is narrating. The "script, direction, costumes and music" of this version are by <a href="http://visagepk.com/iss42/article_10.html">Rizwan Beyg</a>, a fashion designer, as quoted in this <i>Jang</i> <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/sep2004-weekly/nos-12-09-2004/instep.htm">interview</a> and the twist he is putting on the age-old tale is that Anarkali was actually Noor Jehan. Ok. </p>
<p>Which seems to be the same twist in a play by Sohail Malik and his wife Shaiyanne Malik entitled, <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/nov2003-weekly/you-11-11-2003/#8">Anarkali Through The Eyes Of Noor Jahan (The Legend Of The Entombed Flower)</a> that was performed in 2003. These writers have claimed in court that the Broadway show is ripping them off without credit and sued against any public showing of their play and have won! Except, that the the organizers of the NY shindig are still going forward with it. <a href="http://www.satribune.com/archives/sept04/P1_gala.htm">Here</a> are some details, plus cool artwork of the invites, about the case. </p>
<p>All of which still leaves me wondering, which wall is Anarkali in?</p>
