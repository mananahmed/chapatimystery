  content: "This isn't precisely what you're asking for, but I was inspired by the
    example you give of the BAE. DC's inability (or was it lazy disinterest?) to figure
    out what to do about the remaining Native-Americans in the West (as well as the
    \"californios\") has been a persistent feature of their policy for well over a
    century. The inspiring qualitative gesture of the establishment of the BAE is
    followed within 10 years by the Dawes Act, a sort of nuclear option to try and
    bring the locals into the fold as Americans. When that *still* didn't help, in
    1924 the US just gave them blanket citizenship.\r\n\r\nStep 1: try to understand
    them anthropologically (?)\r\nStep 2: turn them into capitalists\r\nStep 3: turn
    them into citizens\r\n\r\nFail after fail after fail. So if your class circles
    around American examples, you could do well to expand the brief description you
    give in the National piece. There are also extra-political examples, like the
    sentimental call to arms that is the novel \"Ramona\" (great fun, but terribly
    long). \r\n\r\nBTW (and FWIW), I'm working on my chapter on \"For Whom the Bell
    Tolls\" now, a novel that is, among other things, about an \"expert\" in the sense
    that you mean. Robert Jordan's professed expertise on Spain (language and customs)--he's
    a prof at Montana!--becomes, I'm starting to think, just an endless black joke
    Hemingway makes at his protagonist's expense."

    it's fair to put Fareed Zakaria in the same basket as Friedman and Stewart? \r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm sure you've already thought of it, but Tim Mitchell's <i>Rule of Experts</i>
    might be helpful in such a class, especially the stuff on inventing the Egyptian
    peasant."

  content: I've now seen both of the Oppenheim/Tell Halaf exhibits in Berlin, and
    per your syllabus request, aspects of the photography exhibit struck me, especially
    the claim that Wilhelm II considered Oppenheim an "Orientexpert." I gather the
    basis for Oppenheim's expertise was that he wandered about the near east plundering
    archaeological sites, photographing Bedouins, and dressing up like one. (Apparently
    he was also in the intelligence service, and helped plot some sort of rebellion
    against the British in India during WWI? I don't know much about that.) The photographs
    themselves are about categorizing people, forming a "database" of sorts for "arabische
    Typen." It's seriously interesting stuff, and there might be space on your syllabus
    for some examination of these German diplomat/collectors, especially since you're
    right here in Berlin with all these resources.

  content: "This is a great piece.  I think one additional factor that could help
    explain the particularities of how the US has produced (or failed to produce)
    expert knowledge about the world lies in the emergence of a modern national-security
    state unlike what, for example, the British had in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nThe
    national-security state spurred a concomitant rise of regimes of secrecy that
    fetishize documents marked &acirc;&euro;&oelig;secret&acirc;&euro;\x9D and require
    an elaborate bureaucracy of vetting and background checks to control access to
    them.  There are several million people in the US who hold a security clearance
    permitting access to some form of classified information, each of whom had to
    undergo a background investigation in order to obtain a personalized privilege
    that can travel with an individual as they switch jobs, even as they leave government
    and become contractors.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the requirements of this secrecy
    apparatus -- driven in large part by paranoia from Great Power competition and
    fears of espionage -- would undermine the cultivation of 'expert' cultural knowledge
    inside the state.  In these background checks, \"foreign\" ties are regarded with
    suspicion in ways that would probably have made much less sense in 19th century
    imperial or settler-colonial contexts.  Foreign travel or having immediate family
    from other parts of the world are regarded as potential sources of influence and
    contagion that must be accounted for and can result in months or years of delay,
    or denial of clearances altogether.  So yes, the US govt laments its lack of people
    with \"cultural knowledge,\" but due to its vetting system it really helps if
    you happen to be white and have never spent time outside the US.  The available
    labor pool shrinks accordingly and reliance on outside sources such as think tanks
    grows.  Empirically, this is probably why certain white American expatriate communities
    -- especially missionaries -- end up providing much of the expert labor for the
    US foreign policy apparatus.  Missionaries have the exposure that gives them the
    requisite cultural skills but their ideological loyalty is seen as more secure.\r\n\r\nSyllabus

  content: 'I''m still thinking about this. Thought about it all throughout my afternoon
    Fusswanderung. Anyways: the photo exhibit, at one point, mentioned in passing
    that the act of taking photographs of people and artefacts was an act of "taking
    possession." That characterization has stayed with me all day: acts of ethnography
    as acts of empire. Hadn''t thought of it that way before. Point 2: Oppenheim wasn''t
    the only guy doing this stuff. One of my absolute favorites is Heinrich Schliemann,
    plunderer of Troy. Ok, I''m done now. Really.'

  content: Thank you so much for writing the article in The National. As a graduate
    of an area studies program (Harvard - Asia) I was completely mesmerized. At a
    reunion last year, there were a few retired professors talking about the McCarthy
    era, and its aftermath, and about the efforts to make area studies less of a second
    class citizen compared to other disciplines in the academic world. Your piece
    really brings up all sorts of fascinating issues.

  content: "I think this is a fascinating subject and would love to see the syllabus,
    in the future, once it's taken shape. I tend to think, however, that it's not
    really incompetence or a lack of expertise, and I seriously doubt the extent to
    which someone Greg Mortenson affects critical policy issues (\"diplomatic\" or
    military). I don't think it's surprising, either, that these celebrities (authors,
    do-goodniks and politicians alike) lack area expertise. The \"real\" experts are
    there, even commissioned to provide information, but are usually silenced or ignored.
    On that note, this episode, particularly the first act, is worth a listen (and
    could perhaps qualify for inclusion in your course, if you want to go multimedia):
    http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/333/the-center-for-lessons-learned\r\n\r\n(On
    the other hand, here's \"citizen diplomacy\": http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/337/man-vs-history/)\r\n\r\nLastly,
    you might want to explore something with which you and other CM readers are no
    doubt familiar -- that is, the so-called Human Terrain Systems program. I would
    say this is something of a catch-22. As academics, we believe in what might be
    called editorial independence, but we also want the government and military to
    be well-informed and sensitive to the local cultures in which they work. At the
    same time, we typically oppose the very efforts which could benefit from specialized
    help. Anyway, this might be something worth investigating, along with programs
    like Boren, which provide funding to young scholars (usually master's students,
    I believe) in national security with the expectation that they'll wind up in public
    service. This all seems like an interesting update of Orientalism, though I'm
    sure there are vast differences."

<p>In the Fall, I am hoping to teach a class on Experts as a category of Knowledge Brokers in the colonial and postcolonial world. Thinking a riff from Richard F. Burton to TE Lawrence to Rory Stewart by way of Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami. Plus databases and spying drones. Here is somewhat of a programmatic preview in <em>The National</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Flying blind: US foreign policy's lack of expertise</strong> </p>
<p>Both Stewart and Mortenson illustrate one particular configuration of the relationship between knowledge and the American empire - the "non-expert" insider who can traverse that unknown terrain and, hence, become an "expert".</p>
<p>Even a cursory examination of the archive dealing with the American efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan demonstrates that there has been no related growth in specific scholarly knowledge about those sites of conflict. The knowledge of Arabic, Urdu or Pashto remains at extremely low levels in official corridors. There is, one can surmise simply from reading the back and forth sway of military and political policy in Afghanistan, very little advancement in understanding of either the text or context of that nation.</p>
<p>In America's imperial theatre, Stewart and Mortenson exemplify a singular notion of "expert". We can build, based on the profiles of other specimens - Robert D Kaplan, Fareed Zakaria, Robert Kagan - a picture of what the ideal type looks like from the official point of view. Such an "expert" is usually one who has not studied the region, and especially not in any academic capacity. As a result, they do not possess any significant knowledge of its languages, histories or cultures. They are often vetted by the market, having produced a bestselling book or secured a job as a journalist with a major newspaper. They are not necessarily tied to the "official" narratives or understandings, and can even be portrayed as being "a critic" of the official policy. In other words, this profile fits one who doesn't know enough.</p>
<p>At the same time there are greater claims, and greater efforts, towards satellite cameras and listening devices; drones which can hover for days; databases which can track all good Taliban and all bad Taliban. Yet who can decipher this data? When one considers the rise of "experts" such as Stewart or Mortenson against the growth of digitised data which remains elusive and overwhelming, one is left with a rather stark observation - that the American war effort prefers its human knowledge circumspect or circumscribed and its technical knowledge crudely totalised.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do read the whole thing and let me know here (I would be SERIOUSLY GRATEFUL for syllabus recs). Also <a href="{{site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2009/12/MananAhmed_FlyingBlind.pdf">the print version has nice pictures</a> [pdf].</p>
<p>Also, I should note that this piece is a continuation of two earlier efforts at the National, and should be read as such:</p>
