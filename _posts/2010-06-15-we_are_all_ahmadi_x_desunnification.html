    semi-urban lives remain out of the pale.\"  really?  always?  and the rural and
    semi urban people who would call themselves 'sunni' are outside what pale?\r\n\r\n\"They
    are always concerned with their upward mobility.\"  wow!  only them?  \r\n\r\n\"They
    want security, prosperity, the latest electronic gadget and the fastest car. For
    themselves.\"  really?  all sunnis are defined by their desire for these things
    exclusively?  or just those who do the chucking out and live in urban areas?  and
    of course the other species you mention are defined only by their oppression?
    \ of course none of them would ever stoop so low as to perhaps want \"security,
    prosperity\" for themselves?  And by themselves, do you mean specifically themselves,
    or for the religious grouping you've clumped them into?\r\n\r\n\"They are never
    poor, never working class, never provincial but they are its consumers: they hire
    the poor for their housework, they buy from their carts, they embrace the diversity

    the colourful beads and the regional sweets.\"  \r\n\r\nreally?  so the majority
    are in fact wealthy, owners of capital, urbanites?  the majority hires the rest
    for housework? and out of all people selling produce on carts, none are sunni?
    \ and those who would chuck out other sunnis from the house somehow also \"embrace
    the diversity of fabric, the exoticness of sufi poetry...\"???\r\n\r\nWhat the
    hell are you talking about in this piece?!?!?  \r\n\r\n\"This is not history.
    \ This is precedent.\"\r\n\r\nYa!  And this is not analysis.  This is gibberish."

  content: "<b>Hate Speech</b>\r\nDawn Editorial - 21/06/10\r\n\r\nA strong case can
    be made against the JI leader for fomenting aggression and religious persecution
    under the country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s laws regarding hate speech and incitement
    to violence. - Photo on file \r\n\r\n<b>The street power and political clout wielded
    by Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s religious right have resulted in the state and
    society being held hostage by extremist elements. The latter stop at nothing to
    further their agenda of inciting hatred, divisiveness and violence. The latest
    example is that of the Jamaat-i-Islami chief, Syed Munawwar Hasan, who during
    a sermon in Lahore on Friday threatened a fresh movement against the Ahmadi community
    if it &ldquo;did not accept their minority status&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    and the government kept silent about &ldquo;their blasphemous and
    unconstitutional activities&acirc;&euro;\x9D.</b>\r\n\r\nMr Hasan did not specify
    any particular instance substantiating his charges, leading one to read his comments
    as hate speech and also as an attempt to blackmail the government into further
    victimising an already persecuted community. Given the incendiary passions the
    issue arouses, any call by religious parties in this context is certain to be
    attended by violence. A strong case can be made against the JI leader for fomenting
    aggression and religious persecution under the country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s laws
    regarding hate speech and incitement to violence. \r\n\r\nEven beyond this particular
    case, it has now become a matter of urgency that the government show an active
    and uncompromising stance on the issue of hate speech and incitement to violence
    or other sorts of criminal activity. Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s polity is already
    rent by religious, ethnic and sectarian divisions. Allowing irresponsible and
    divisive opinions to be aired publicly will deepen these fissures. Once it begins,
    the process of religious, ethnic and other communities being pitted against one
    another will prove difficult to bring under control. Spiralling violence, particularly
    in view of other issues being faced by the country such as militancy and terrorism,
    can then be expected. It is in the interests of both the state and citizenry to
    take a stand against inflammatory hate speech and lobby for the prosecution of
    those who break the law."

  content: "One has to wonder whether the writer (a proclaimed 'historian') has actually
    studied world history.\r\n\r\nIf one were to study social interactions through
    the ages in just about every nation that has arisen, one would come across something
    known as a bourgoisie vs proletarian conflict-dynamic. Heard of it? Probably not.
    I just made up the term.\r\n\r\nFar be it from wonderful Pakistan to succumb to
    this experience. Especially for a nation state that is only one of two to be ever
    founded on the basis of religion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, intra-religion conflict? Really?
    Seriously? Wow. Who would have thunk it?!"

<p>My piece, <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/20305/house-on-the-hill/">House on the Hill</a>, June 13, 2010 in The Express Tribune about the illusion of safety which envelops the Sunni upper-middle-class.</p>
<blockquote><p>
There is the majority, the people who live in this house. They are always Sunni Muslim &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; though they are quite capable of throwing this or that &ldquo;Sunni&rdquo; faction out in a heart beat. They are always urban &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; the rural, the semi-urban lives remain out of the pale. They are always concerned with their upward mobility. They want security, prosperity, the latest electronic gadget and the fastest car. For themselves. They are never poor, never working class, never provincial but they are its consumers: they hire the poor for their housework, they buy from their carts, they embrace the diversity of fabric, the exoticness of &ldquo;Sufi poetry&rdquo;, the colourful beads and the regional sweets.<br />
...<br />
The majority is not so secure, however. Some say Allah Hafiz and some Khuda Hafiz. Some are known to say Ameen aloud in prayer and some under their breath. Some hang amulets around their necks and some don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t. Some shave their beards, others grow mustaches. Some are known to skip Qur&acirc;&euro;&trade;an studies for IT. Some practice birth control. Some take only one wife. Some actually believe in that Sufi business. Some put God in a cabinet. Some are vegetarian.</p>
<p>Once the Ahmadis, the Shi&acirc;&euro;&trade;as, the Hindus, the Christians were also part of the upstairs. They were also members of the house. The poor were once the founders. Slowly, they were moved down; eliminated. This is not history. This is precedent.</p></blockquote>
