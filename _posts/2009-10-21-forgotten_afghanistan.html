  content: "An interesting piece, although I remain somewhat reticent about such rhetoric,
    because it can easily be used to deflect arguments against increased intervention
    by outside powers -- although the argument never seems to prevent involvement
    in any but the most humanitarian conflicts (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Balkan-Ghosts-Journey-Through-History/dp/0679749810\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Balkan Ghosts</a>, anyone?). That is, it's an argument that might
    be deployed in Year 8 of a war, not Year 0.  Nevertheless, because it helps
    disturb the sanguine (and maddeningly superficial) view of Afghanistan as a country
    that one can 't do anything about, as a land, discussions about which are bookended
    by phrases like \"imperial graveyard\" and \"fiercely ungovernable\", the piece
    is welcome.  The evocative photographs don't hurt either."
