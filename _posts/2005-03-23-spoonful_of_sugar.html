  content: 'Sepoy cannot be harmed by the likes of Paglia (though I admit nobody has
    every tried grits before). I don''t think a single author will do it: you''ll
    need a carefully calibrated mix of Orientalists, semi-amateur Islamologists, literary
    junk (Paglia alone won''t do it: Stanley Fish, though, might make a dent) and
    probably some Victor Davis Hanson.... But don''t quote me.'

    <strong>"A Very Sad Day For India"</strong>

    I think, sadly, that this is probably the best that would have been produced in the short term; at least there were some sops to the poor in this. Nonetheless, it really is a very sad day for India, poor developing countries, AIDS patients, and me, w...

    <strong>Expensive Drugs in India soon?</strong>

    Liberalization can be unpopular, as we found out recently as the Lok Sabha (Lower House) in the Indian Parliament passed a bill banning domestic firms from manufacturing low-cost generic drugs of patented drugs. It is the end of protectionist policies

<p><i>[Editor's note: I admit it. I have Sepoy. He is safe, for now. Leave $20m Euros on my porch, or I will read Camille Paglia to him and force feed him instant grits.]</i></p>
<p>Assured poor folk will be able to get meds cheap, Indian parliamentary "leftists" unchained themselves from the proverbial redwood and, at last, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/234270.html">20 year patent protections have come to the Indian drug market.</a> Apparently, this legislative change came at the behest of the <a href="http://www.aidsnews.org/2004/12/india-patent.html">WTO</a>, which will undoubtedly approve of the expected boon in <a href="http://www.tdg.ch/tghome/tgnews.detailcateg.YWZwLmNvbToyMDA1MDMyMzowNTAzMjMxMTIxMjEuNHE2cXV4YTc6MQ==.1.0.html">outsourcing</a> from US and European pill pressers. The big question is whether India and its neighbors will suddenly develop designer neuroses. Keep an eye out for totally nonsensical ads filmed by bollywood's hottest directors, featuring eerily gleeful people leaping through meadows and watching sunsets from deck-mounted bathtubs.</p>
