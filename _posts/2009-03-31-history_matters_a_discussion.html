  content: I'm no scholar, but I'll take your "anyone" as an invitation; I have not
    read the new Doniger book, but if you announce a symposium at a few days notice,
    I will make sure I read it and participate...

  content: "This is too tempting to pass up. I'll just ask for a few days notice,
    like Qalandar, and go get the book. There are some lines of argument in Doniger's
    work that, I think, are open to critique. These strands of argument, for instance,
    in Doniger's essay, \"Presidential Address: `I Have Scinde': Flogging a Dead (White
    Male Orientalist),\" and an engagement with those concerns could be folded into
    a discussion about the current text.  The other general question I have relates
    to Doniger's point about Hinduism being puritanical before the colonial encounter
    with the British. I am thinking of how Doniger may respond to Nandy's argument
    that colonialism is destructive precisely because it rearranges priorities *within*
    a culture, making  one dimension or a recessive strand stand in for the dominant
    perspective. A third general issue relates to Doniger's position about the politics
    of authority in the academy regarding who gets to speak for Hinduism. I was at
    Emory during the attack on Paul Courtright for his book on Ganesha and some of
    the same issues came up. The Hindu right argument was that other in disciplinesand
    programs-- especially African American Studies and Jewish Studies-- the majority
    of scholars / appointments inhabit those identity categories. But the study of
    Hinduism, housed under Religion Departments and others, does not conform to this
    pattern. I am not an apologist for the Hindu Right, but the general question here
    is whether a discussion on who represents Hinduism also needs to take into account
    questions of representative authority in other programs entangled in questions
    of cultural or collective identity. What is sophisticated about the Hindu Right
    argument-- despite their particular substantive claims like the Taj Mahal being
    a Hindu structure etc easily identified as bogus--- is the mode in which it has
    mobilized a logic of identity politics seen in the academy and in American society
    at large. The American Right also did something similar effectively beginning
    in the 1980s or so drawing upon the identity politics model of civil rights, racial
    rights, women's rights, and LGBT rights models)  Best Rohit"

  content: Hey - why am I not invited! I don't have the linguistic skills, apart from
    some very rough Sanskrit to make a really informed contribution though. I am more
    into the politics and historiography of the debates.

  content: 'Rohit: I don''t think the situation you allude to testifies to the sophistication
    of right-wing discourse, but to the fact that so-called "progressives" in the
    American academies have gotten bogged down in identity politics/notions of authenticity
    that are accepted as "givens" (if they pertain to minorties or historically disfavored
    groups) -- while one sympathizes with the groups represented on account of historical
    injustices, this "reification" and uncritical acceptance of such identities in
    so many contexts is easily open to appropriation by reactionary currents...'

    of Ms. Doniger's book and found this! Anyway, do I have to provide credentials
    of some sort to join in the discussion of the book (which I will be purchasing
    tomorrow)? I'm a writer and have knowledge in literature (and also philosophy/religion
    and history, but those are not my focus). That includes sanskrit literature and
    classical tamil literature..."

    studies in universities. I completely agree about the identity politics comment
    qalandar made. That said, I despise Orientalism, and I hope that word will soon
    become an odd historical curiosity instead of a disicpline. sepoy, thanks for
    welcoming me. When are you thinking about doing the symposium?"

<p>I have greatly learned, and thoroughly enjoyed, a series of discussion on Judith Bennett's <i>History Matters</i>. The <a href="http://girlscholar.blogspot.com/2009/03/history-matters-grand-finale-guest-post.html">response</a> from Judith Bennett (and, what a response!) also includes links to the discussion before. Go read. I promise you, that you will learn. If only we had more SAists running blogs, I would love to do the same online symposia on Wendy Doniger's book. What about it DK? Rohit? Anyone? Bueller?</p>
