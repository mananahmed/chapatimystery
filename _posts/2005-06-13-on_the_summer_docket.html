    DEAR SCHOLAR,
    i AM NOT A MYSTERIAN BUT WOULD LOVE TO RECOMMEND YOU TO READ A HOLY BOOK ie QURAN, WITH A VIEW TO UNDESTAND WHAT aLLAH aLMIGHTY HAS REVEALED IN THIS BOOK FOR THE WELFARE AND BETTERMENT OF HUMANKIND. PERHAPS U KNOW MUCH ABT ALL THINGS IN THIS UNIVERSE BUT YOU HAVE TO LEARN,REMEMBER,ACT AND FOLLOW STRICTLY WHAT HAS BEEN COMMANDED IN THIS BOOK FOR THE BELIEVERS. IT IS HIGH TIME TO ENJOY ITS RECITATION AND IN DEPTH TEACHING. I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD LOVE MORE THAN OTHER FICTIONS, MOVIES ETC WHICH ARE CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE MIND AND SPIRIT AND BETRAYING TOWARDS A PATH WHICH IS NOT STRAIGHT.
    IN CASE YOU ARE INTERESTED I WOULD POINT TO YOU CERTAIN SURA`S WHICH ARE VERY BENIFICIAL?
    YOUR CHOICE IS NOT MY CHOICE. SINCE U ASKED FOR IT, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUGGEST YOU THE BEST READING. HOPE YOU WOULD CONSIDER MY PROPOSAL.
    MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU WITH SUCCESS, HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY.

  content: "Book - \nYou: Victor Pelevin, <i>Babylon</i>. Contemporary Russian half-insane
    hallucinogenic genre-hopping philosophical mentalism for the jittering. If I had
    to write one of those awful \"name doing name\"-type blurbs it would be: \"Pelevin
    is a schizophrenic Murakami, blundering into a rave club run by Kafka\". Staying
    in the almost-contemporary: <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, David Mitchell (or any of his
    books).\n\nMe: Personally, I'm reading Stendhal and Alain Badiou, but I'm getting
    a bit tired of the latter now. I thought <i>Small Island</i>, Andrea Levy, was
    pretty good, but I'm still waiting for my summer \"blow me away\" book.\n\nFilm
    - \nYou: <i>Dogville</i>, if you missed it.\n\nMe: Cronenberg Night, our house,
    Wednesday."

  content: "I wish I could share in your carefree exuberance about leisure reading
    and film viewing over the summer - that pesky dissertation and course preparation
    duties loom large though.  \n\nIn keeping with the class I am putting together,
    my first round of books on the docket have that distinctive postcolonial flavor
    to them. A few fictions and literary memoirs I plan to revisit:- \n-CLR James
    <em>Beyond a Boundary</em> and <em>Minty Alley</em>: the raceínícricket
    classic and a quirky novel about class in the West Indies\n-Albert Memmi <em>A
    Pillar of Salt</em> and <em>The Colonizer and the Colonized</em>: semi-autobiographical
    tale of a Jewish lad in WWII Tunisia, mapping new terrains of double-consciousness
    that combines well with his readable psycho-cultural theory classic; both are
    translated from French\n-Sara Suleri <em>Meatless Days</em> and <em>The Rhetoric
    of English India</em>): truly masterful personal history of upper middle class
    femininity in postcolonial Pakistan, the richness of which grows on me with each
    reading; serve alongside a tiny portion of her dense literary theory powerhouse\n\nThe
    preoccupations of Empire Week continue (for some of us at least), and here are
    a couple imperial history books I have been meaning to read:-\n-David Scott <em>Conscripts
    of Modernity</em>: argues via examinations of the colonial and postcolonial histories
    of the Caribbean that tragedy is a more appropriate literary mode than romance
    for narrating the era of decolonization and thinking past the shortcomings of
    postcolonial states\n-Catherine Hall <em>Civilising Subjects</em>): based in part
    on an examination of missionaries in colonial Jamaica, Hall demonstrates the extent
    to which race (both the &Atilde;&laquo;island raceí of the &Atilde;&laquo;exceptionalí
    British themselves and blackness in the post-emancipation era) remained a crucial
    component of British imperial and domestic consciousness\n\nFor a little more
    fun:-\n-Greil Marcus <em>In the Fascist Bathroom</em>: Marcusí astute
    and politicized music journalism from Johnny Rotten to Cyndi Lauper and Gang of
    Four to Prince\n-Roy Moxham <em>The Great Hedge of India</em>: a wacky British
    librarian presents in the form of a detective story his hunt for the relics of
    a customs barrier wrought of prickly pear bushes \n\nAs for movies, a few things
    that are verified netflickable (in no particular order):-\n<em>Cotton Comes to
    Harlem</em> (early &Atilde;&laquo;blaxploitationí gem), <em>Joint
    Security Area</em> (plays well alongside some of Mantoís partition
    stories on the theme of arbitrary borders), <em>Dog Day Afternoon</em> (from one
    hot summer to another), <em>Ab Tak Chhappan</em> (latest great Bombay police-crime
    flick, picks up where RGVís classics <em>Satya</em> and <em>Company</em>
    leave off; thanks to Rajeev for this suggestion in the first place), <em>Soy Cuba/I
    am Cuba</em> (a truly incredible and nuanced set of linked pieces funded by the
    Castro government) and <em>Do the Right Thing</em> (perhaps the best summer movie
    ever) \n\nAnd a trio of top basketball flicks, because the Heat lost and both
    Larry Brown and Tim Duncan are Sith Lords: <em>Cooley High</em>; <em>Cornbread,
    Earl and Me</em>; <em>He Got Game</em>"

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/summerreading.jpg">Mid June and it is finally hot as all hell here in Chicago. Just when I was beginning to think that this summer will be tame. Ha. The weekend was great. Some superb hanging on-s with friends and lovers. Some discussions of plans for the summer as well. All of this reminded me that I have no real plans beyond some interminable writing. Usually, by this time, I have a list of books that I want to read and movies that I am looking forward to and all that. Sadly, I have none for this year. </p>
<p>So. I thought that I can ask you, gentle readers. Tell me what to read and see. Tell me what you are reading and watching this summer. It will be all "interactive" and "blog-like", our little exchange. </p>
<p><b>Books</b>: Things vaguely on the list: Ben Macintyre's <i>The Man Who Would Be King : The First American in Afghanistan</i> [looks quite a rollicking ride]; Janet Afary's <i>Foucault and the Iranian Revolution : Gender and the Seductions of Islamism</i> [now this ought to be interesting]; Elizabeth Kostova's <i>The Historian</i>[beach reading, no? And Dracula is my absolute fav. character]; Michel Houellebecq's <i>H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life</i> [a writer I admire and a writer I can't decide on- woohoo]; Modris Eksteins's <i>Rites of Spring : The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age</i> [been on the list for a while.]. That's really all. What do you recommend? Incidentally, I have a <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/registry/Y6R1HMJKIIWS">wishlist</a> for those wishing good thoughts to me.</p>
<p><b>Movies</b>: Netflix rules summer. I am goinging through all of Peckinpah and all of Kurosawa [some gems are missing] as well as whatever comes out of Korea - like <i>Sympathy for Lady Vengeance</i>! <i>Batman Begins or Rules</i> or whatever looks mildly interesting. <i>War of the World</i> not even. Terry Gilliam's <i>Brothers Grimm</i> should be good. Um. That's about all I can think of.</p>
<p><b>GeekCode</b>: I want to give some time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. See if we can jazz some web-apps up.</p>
<p>So, let's hear it people [especially, people who call themselves Mysterians].</p>
