  content: "Aray baba where is the evidence?\n\n\n\nA quick Google news search shows
    hundred of pages screaming \"India had evidence linking the 7/11 blasts to Pakistan,
    to ISI and Bhawalpur, linking 7/11 to 9/11, linking 7/11 to Mohammed Ata, linking
    Ata to Pakistan...\"  Also \"India to present evidence here, there and every where...\"\n\n\n\nThe
    evidence ofcourse is 11 Pakistani's 9 of them missing, 2 of them dead and untraceable,
    phone calls to Nepal with references to money, a mysterious Mr. Cheema, truth
    serum confessions with vivid description of scenic Bhawalpur camps, a Unani (Grecko
    Roman?) Hakeem and the overworked imagination of Bombay police. \n\n\n\nThis is
    all Mushie's fault.  If the stupid book hadn't touched #2 on Amazon, he hadn't
    done 60 minutes and the Daily Show in the same week, and the book hadn't sold
    10,000 copies in India, this would still be an open investigation. \n\n\n\nIndian
    turn to bomb us back to the stone age?"

  content: Oh and this is the same Bombay police that has skillfully solved and linked
    every single crime in the last 50 years on Bombay soil all the way back to a mysterious
    Mr.X at ISI (replace X with Cheema's, Chaudhries, Khans and Ansari's since most
    ISI professionals come form above  mentioned families... except for our own Sepoy).

<p><img align="left" alt="hawkins-pressure-cooker-1-5-lit.jpg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2006/10/hawkins-pressure-cooker-1-5-lit.thumbnail.jpg" />The Hindustan Times reported the latest on the Mumbai blasts yesterday with this catchy headline:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/5922_1810459,0015002500000000.htm">11 Pakistanis behind 11/7</a></p>
<p>The number eleven seems to be catching on as an inauspicious numeral for terror following the ubiquitous and international use of 'nine-eleven' to describe the events that transpired on that date in 2001 in the United States. The US meaning of 911 as an emergency phone number has probably been lost or forgotten by the rest of the world (has anyone ever been able to prove that al Qaeda used that date for symbolic purposes, or was it just a crazy coincidence?).  Of course, India's 11/7 is American's 7/11, an association that desis here tend to avoid.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that the explosives were hidden in <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/01/stories/2006100107621000.htm">eight pressure cookers</a> in Churchgate Station.  Does this mean we won't be allowed to bring our cookers in our carry-on luggage anymore?</p>
