    conclusion that the world could draw was that no one studies things in Pakistan
    or, having studied them, deliberately keeps quiet until a false crisis can be

  content: Manan,  Your view of Pakistan assumes that the civilians are already strong
    enough in Pakistan that the army would not slide back to full jihadi mode even
    if the US were to leave the region. I think that assumption is faulty. The army
    is starting to fight some of its old students and trainees, but it is determined
    to hold on to its dominant position in the power structure. If the US were to
    leave suddenly (as opposed to achieving some sort of functioning Afghan regime
    and forcing the taliban to accept a political deal rather than continued fighting)
    the army will go back to its old ways. That is their default setting. And there
    is no civilian force strong enough yet to stop them. You also underestimate the
    power of the taliban/jihadi network and the depth of their support in Pakistan,
    especially in the army. Without significant US help, they will not be defeated
    by the army even if the army wants to stay on the job. We can reconnect after
    a few months to see where things stand...btw, I am willing to consider that if
    the people of that region want a certain jihadi ideology and are willing to fight
    for it, why should the US be there killing people (no matter how surgically, and
    I think the US army is actually a much more surgical instrument than any of the
    local armies, who cause far more collateral damage)? Let the people in the region
    kill each other or not. Let the US leave. But let us not sell some illusion about
    how peaceful everything will be if only the US leaves....

  content: "btw,  Can someone outline a scenario in which the Nation would SUPPORT
    a US military mission in Afghanistan? If not, then I suggest that their \"analysis\"
    is an example of taking a position (anti-war, morally perfectly defensible) and
    then going out and finding any evidence they can to bolster their position.  Personally,
    I dont think the US does a great job of policing the world. And I certainly dont
    think it always or even usually acts in the interests of poor people in the region
    they are policing. Like the police everywhere, their first job is to protect the
    property of the rich (mostly their own).   Ideally, they should never have
    gone into Afghanistan and occupied it.  As an American, I think we should pull
    out and stay out. As a Pakistani, I am not so sure.  I suspect that we have already
    set in motion a jihadi machine that will not stop if the US leaves and that our
    own state is neither able nor willing to handle it (and would prefer to point
    outwards to India and Afghanistan). With 50 nuclear bombs (which supposedly work
    more reliably than India's rickety collection of semi-duds) and lots of grievances,
    I see far too much \"collateral damage\" down the road...."

  content: Salman ji, NOT nukes in the hands of terrorists, but nukes in the hands
    of a military establishment that is in bed with terrorists and will use the terrorists
    against afghanistan and India and will ultimately find itself fighting a war with
    both......My conspiracy theory beats your "nukes in the hands of terrorists" theory
    hands down...

  content: 'An interesting read, more because of who he managed to interview, from
    Abdul Ghazi to Malauna Fazullah, is Nicholas Schmidle''s book "To live or to Perish
    Forever: Two tumultous years in Pakistan". I didn''t like a lot of the author''s
    judgements but it was a rare look into various parts of Pakistan that are rarely
    reported on directly from Baluchistan to interactions with several of the Rem
    Mosque leaders before it was stormed.'
