    \  I am afraid of the poerful looney center that gave standing ovations to GW
    Bush, and is now giving them to Obama.    Kudos to Glen Greewald and others
    for exposing Obama as a looney wingnut himself.   http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/"

  content: "And continuing in the same vein . . .  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/opinion/18collins.html?th&amp;ewc=th  Gotta

    of the Republican Party is intent on cutting off the knees of the administration
    before it actually manages to fulfill any campaign promises on reducing the huge
    economic gap between the top 5 percent of the country and the rest of the populace.
    In pursuit of that mission, fortune favors the hysterical and rewards politicians
    who behave like gerbils that just bit into an electric wire.\""
