    just referring to a sort of hybrid of ahmed nadeem qasmi and nasir kazmi--your
    very own postcolonial rupture of memory, eh boy?

<p>Lahore, if you want to believe me, is a city <em>about</em> food. The second most popular gossip in Lahore is about specific sites/corners in the city and the specific foods available there. The first most popular being a vehement disagreement/challenge/let-us-go-RIGHT-NOW-and-SEE about that food-stuff. Or maybe, this is just <em>my</em> Lahore. I mentioned earlier that I have been reading memoirs of Lahore and it is seriously messing with my head. I know Lahore, intimately in some areas, cursorily in others; but I know Lahore. I can usually imagine any intersection, any particular cluster of shops or houses. As I read memoirs of Lahore (most concentrated on the 1940s and 50s), I began to notice some oddities in my recollections. I was somehow sublimating those memories as my own memories of Lahore. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/5609204081/" title="Chai Khan by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/5609204081_441b3361f2_z.jpg" width="580" alt="Chai Khan"></a></p>
<p>A. Hameed, noted writer, in his <em>Lahore ki Yadeein</em> (Memories of Lahore) (2000) describes drinking chai at Pak Tea House and a particular gentleman seated on the table over, who delightfully would lean over and openly eavesdrop on everyone's conversation (everyone being people like Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi and Ibn-e Insha). I swear I have that same memory. Except I am sure that I never met Qasmi or Insha. Almost certain, actually. There are other oddities - F. E. Chaudhry, one of the greatest news photographer of Pakistan, describes a meeting with Faiz Ahmed Faiz in the <em>Pakistan Times</em> office in his memoir <em>Ab woh Lahore Kahan?</em> (Now, Where is that Lahore?) (2009). I was there. I think.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/5609192577/" title="Fish Being Cleaned by a Child. Look At Him. by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5609192577_7c95ab6926_z.jpg" width="580" alt="Fish Being Cleaned by a Child. Look At Him."></a></p>
<p>My problems with memory seep into things other than Lahore. I mis-remember people. I forget that someone was funny. Or that I had already read something and that this spark of a misshapen "new" thought was really the blob of a half-memory. These things, the worry about these things, seem to prey on me only when I am not paying attention. Or when my attention is diverted by memoirs or by food. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/5609196957/" title="Lunch by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5609196957_9875f7a5ca_z.jpg" width="580" alt="Lunch"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/5609781120/" title="Nihari by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5609781120_d0865b59ca_z.jpg" width="580" alt="Nihari"></a></p>
<p>The thing about food is, I am not actually a foodie or someone who cares a lot about gastronomic pleasures. All my food memories are people memories. All my taste-buds are conversation-buds. I like to be with my friends, my loved ones. I like to see them enjoy the food. Probably why I like cooking so much more. </p>
<p>So, when I say Lahore is a city about food - I am saying Lahore is a city where I like talking about food. That's a quirk of my memory. </p>
<p>There will be more pictures of foods, but these are street pictures - taken hastily, in passing, walking, talking. Except for two meals which are documented in this series, I ate at home every day. I will post those later. </p>
