<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72057594086468939/"><img src="/images/truthbush.jpg"/></a>Over the weekend, we went to a rally marking the third anniversary of the war. We being myself, <a href="http://www.landoflime.com/archives/calm-entry/protesting-the-war/">pdcs</a> and our lynchpin, rajeev. It was a chilly night. The atmosphere was festive, even. There were the usual anarchists/socialists/communists/retired school teachers but also a lot of people with no banners, hands stuck in pockets, just walking. I later learned that there were around 7,000 people, making it one of the biggest protests in the country. I couldn't tell from being smackdab in the middle and not being 9 feet tall. I can say that there were more cops than people though. Most looked bored to be there - trussed up in their plastic riot gear. As we walked down the <a href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/chicago/magnificentmile.htm">Magnificent Mile</a>, the throngs of shoppers lined up behind the copwall, sometimes giving us the victory sign, sometimes shaking their head from side-to-side in disapproval. It was a little odd, this division between the consumer and the protester. On the one side feverishly gripped signs calling Bush a criminal; on the other side clenched shopping bags with untold goodness from Virgin Megastore. The slogans were tired [I fondly recalled the amazing slogans from my college days of jamaatis and ajt-wallas screaming 'asia sabaz/surq hai!']. Most were about pulling the troops out. We discussed that. I don't want the troops to pull out immediately nor can we. It will be a few more years, still.  </p>
<p>I was there mainly to make sure that we can do some more of this come Iran War. Anyways, the pictures are up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72057594086468939/">here</a> including all the Empire and colony references I could find. </p>
