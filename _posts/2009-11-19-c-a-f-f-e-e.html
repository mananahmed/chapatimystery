    of wicked tricks, and he journeyed in this cart throughout the land, going hither
    and thither from one tribe to another, dispensing to each nation a small portion
    of his wares. When he reached the land of the Arabs, so the story goes, his cart
    suddenly broke down along the way and was stuck there. The Arabs seized the contents
    of the cart as if it were a merchant's valuable cargo...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/521.htm"

  content: "AIG\r\nIt is easy to lay off Aesop, who is long dead and quite possibly
    did not exist. A bit of piracy may be ok between friends. This fable is not about
    piracy though. It is about racial charaecterisation / fear /abuse. Please read
    the linked page before you make up your mind. The rules of public discourse and
    popular culture are obviously different now in multi racial societies and an interconnected
    world. I doubt very much that this fable will find a place in the Arabic edition.\r\nGerry\r\nI
    think in Herr Hering's time religious and racial identity of the Turks would be
    rolled into one 'other'. And it would mean one and the same thing to his audience."

  content: "The assertion that the religious and racial identity of Turks would be
    part of one \"other\" to 19th-century Germans requires some support.  By the 18th
    century - let alone the 19th - German-speaking Christians had communicated with,
    fought with, lived alongside, been governed by, traded with, visited, signed treaties
    with, and been visited by Turks for hundreds of years.  German-speaking universities
    were the among the earliest European centers of formal study of  Arabic, Persian,
    and Ottoman Turkish.  Long before Germany was anything more than a vague cultural
    notion, German speakers could distinguish between Turks and the various Muslim,
    Christian, and Jewish populations under Ottoman rule.  \r\n\r\nAs Germans could
    distinguish among  Turks and Arabs and Persians, Turks could tell the difference
    between Prussians, Austrians, and Sicilians.  Something analogous to 19th- and
    20th-century racism might be present among some of all these peoples, but the
    notion of a monolithic \"other\" - or even a series of monolithic \"others\" -
    is at best an oversimplification."

    was thought of in similar terms by the Hindus. He looted Hindu temples and indulged
    in rape and pillage in his invasions of India, not once or twice but 18 times.
    I suppose he looted enough to commission this epic poem. Of course I'm forgetting
    the traditional story that he still shortchanged Firdausi :)\r\n\r\nLakshmi Srinivas"
