    (at your service)....

    Wow.  It appears to be a Turkified mash-up of The Ring, 28 Days Later, and all those religious-shlock horror films based on overliteral readings of Revelations....except here the quasi-theological basis is a verse from thr Qur'an (Surat an-Nami, the Ant, which says "And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall produce from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them, for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs," acc. to one online text).   I can't get the trailer to play, but the description on the film site says the premise is (paraphrased) that late at night, you're alone, and get an email from a friend, with a picture attached--and when you look at it, you're infected with some sort of electromagentically-transmitted virus/demon (the dabbe/beast), and doomsday (kiyamet) is on its way....one of the newspaper articles/reviews linked to on the site calls it "the first Islamic horror movie."

    i have no idea what mainstream interpretations of that verse are, but here's a great <a href="http://www.endoftimes.net/02signsofdoomsday10.html" rel="nofollow">signs-of-the-apocalypse webpage  </a> (based on the writings of some Turkish dude calling himself Harun Yahya) that asks, is television the dabbe?

    damn, i totally want to see this now.  Turkish pop cinema is really branching out genre-wise.  A big hit when I was there last summer was a sci-fi flick whose poster made me laugh for totally unintended reasons: the film was called G.O.R.A.

    thanks for the free translation. I owe you one."

    alas, I did not get a G.O.R.A. poster.  But I do have a lot of nice Turkish anti-Bush posters from the NATO meeting protests.

    if you want to see/purchase some awesome cheesy vintage turkish movie posters, check <a href="http://www.turkposter.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> out.

  content: hi guys i am impressed to see you are interrested in the Turkish movie.
    i think you can find a G.O.R.A poster on the Turkish sites as it was the most
    popular Turkish comedy ever made. in a way it teases with an another Turkish movie
    "D&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&ordm;nyayi Kurtaran Adam" or "The man who saves
    the World" which is among the worst and funniest films of the whole world cinema
    history.it makes a parody of matrix and the average turkish man in the street
    as well.about dabbe, it is to come soon to the theatres here, the original thing
    about it is that for the first time seriously(i dont count the turkish version
    of the exorcist hehehe)the character is an islamic motif, here the genes and such
    things are really scary elements of our childhood horror stories. most turx either
    adult or  teenager still cant sleep after such stories so it has a psychological
    effect i assume. but unlike christianity which is a middle-eastern religion as
    well the influence of Satan and other bad guys is more iminent in the islamic
    mythology(not sure what to call it but i folklore can apply too)in fact i would
    rather make a film on incubus.anywaY GOT TO GO. SEE YOU SOON.
