  content: "I see a lot of people blaming America, but I think the Egyptian regime
    is primarily responsible and was almost certainly egged on by the Saudis and other
    Arab autocrats. Israel may have played a role but the US less so.\r\nThe current
    American administration is not likely to initiate such advice, In the name of
    stability (which is actually all about Israeli occupation and not about stability)
    they are OK with suppression as long as it works. But I think they are smart enough
    to know that the best option here was not to have thugs smash heads in Tahrir
    square.\r\nThe best option from the US point of view was to have Mubarak kicked
    out by some other army people and then have an interim (still fully pro-US) govt
    in place. This violence is not their first choice. Its not a matter of being moral
    or good. Its simply common sense. Any idiot could see that the best option for
    Egypt would be a smooth transition to a new Egypt and the US has nothing to gain
    by having Mubarak reimpose temporary control by force.\r\nMubarak is not the Chinese
    communist party, which faced much narrower opposition in Tienanmen and with its
    large and disciplined organization it could kill thousands and impose order and
    sustain it for years (though not forever), and in any case, it provides very efficient
    capitalism to its people. 10% growth keeps many people quiet.\r\nMubarak and his
    fellow crooks are in no such position and rely on nothing more than American bribes
    (paid on behalf of Israeli occupation) to barely survive. They can beat people
    into temporary silence (even that may not work now) but their future is darker
    after these acts. So, its bad for Egypt, its bad for the poor people of Egypt,
    but its not even in the interests of the US and I dont think the US has instigated
    this&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."

  content: "It is interesting that some American commentators are using the &ldquo;clashes&rdquo;
    trope. If you hear anyone say &ldquo;clashes between pro and anti-Mubarak
    forces&rdquo; that can only mean one of two things:\r\n1. The commentator
    is a total ass and actually has no idea what is going on. Which is a good way
    to identify the total asses working in the media.\r\nOR\r\n2. The commentator
    believes he or she is doing a service to American/Israeli interests by projecting
    the thug crackdown as &ldquo;clashes&rdquo;. Secondarily,
    this also means he or she is a bit of an ass because the US does not have enough
    of a media monopoly in the world and this sort of reporting/disinformation will
    only confuse the more clueless faction of the American people without influencing
    events in any way&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;"

  content: "Though I should add that Admiral Mike Mullen (who runs his own foreign
    policy, from Pakistan to Egypt) has talked to the Egyptian army chief and expressed
    &ldquo;confidence in the army's ability to maintain
    order&rdquo;. http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=62665\r\nObama
    should take some initiative to rein in the Pentagon, otherwise things will go
    from bad to worse in this country too. I dont really think the pentagon is entirely
    evil (some of them probably are, but that is true in most institutions), I think
    their biggest negative is that they are stupid AND they dont know how stupid they
    are. That is a very bad combination, unfortunately its commonplace in militaries&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.The
    US military is actually better than average in this matter (before anyone jumps
    on me, I am comparing armies to armies, not to vegan support groups in San Francisco)
    because the US army is not totally isolated from normal society and many officers
    are remarkably well educated. But still, they cannot resist the sight of a smartly
    turned out officer and in third world countries their leaders tend to see &ldquo;disciplined
    army&rdquo; and the &ldquo;out-of-control rabble&rdquo;
    and nothing in between."

  content: "Revolution that brings about no change should not be called revolution.\r\nEconomically
    US can cripple Egypt so they don't really care who\r\ncomes to power.  Egypt still
    has to finance its debt owned by other countries.\r\n\r\nthe Suez Canal, gas export,
    workers' remittances, and tourism is\r\ntheir main revenue generator.  They will
    need help from Saudi Arabia\r\nwith remittance and subsidized Oil since Oil is
    no longer exported.\r\n\r\nWith food and fuel prices subsidized, you can keep
    a populous in check\r\nwhich the best and brightest leave.  Modern World and Nation
    States\r\nis only 100 year old yet people think this is the way it has been and
    will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nYemen oil reserves are not expected to last more than 9 years.\r\nMexico
    suppose to stop exporting oil by 2012 which accounts for 40% of budget.\r\nI guess
    the mexicans are growing marijuana because NAFTA decimated their corn\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nI
    didn't even talk about global warming.\r\nExponential Growth is a bitch.  Humans
    cannot overcome it no matter what\r\nyet how many are even taught anything about
    it."

  content: "Egypt will head in the direction that Pakistan and Iran have taken after
    Mubarak is ousted. And that is not a happy thought.\r\nI shed no tears for Mubarak
    and his group, but fear for the Egyptians and their future.\r\nThe Muslim brotherhood
    will take over, though not immediately, and Egypt will then start its march backwards.\r\nAny
    interim leader, such as El Baradei, will turn out to be the Kerensky of his time
    and place, a well meaning intellectual out of touch with Egyptians, and undermined
    till overthrown, by the Moslem Brotherhood.\r\nThe real 'democrats' in Egypt will
    be eaten alive, squeezed between an army loosing power and the Islamic Brotherhood
    gaining it, and without either the organization or the bloody mindidness to prevail.\r\nThe
    naive well meaning westerners will watch helpless and in dismay as their fantasy
    world for the future of Egypt disappears.\r\nSad sad stuff.\r\nAnd, oh yes, if
    there really was a democratically elected government in Egypt, the 85% of the
    people who believe that an unfaithful women should be killed, the 75 % who believe
    a thief should have a hand or foot amputated and the 95 % who believe that an
    apostate from Islam should be killed, will all get their way.\r\nThe above figures
    are from a Pew survey done in Egypt recently; i may have got the figures confused,
    but the general tone is correct.\r\nPoor Egypt; poor Egyptians."

  content: "Elites matter more than the rest of the people, even in a democracy. The
    75% who want hands cut off are just repeating whatever mindless propaganda they
    have vaguely heard about a religion they identify with...it doesnt matter, not
    even in a democracy.\r\nThe elite is probably marginally smarter than the Pakistani
    elite. If Pakistan can be within shooting range of a functioning democracy, Egypt
    has a chance as well. The Muslim brotherhood is not as well organized as they
    are being projected. I agree that democratic Egypt may turn into an Islamist disaster
    zone, but it may also do better. Or it may become like democratic Russia or even
    democratic Belarus...that seems the most likely outcome to me... or some kind
    of army rule with a democratic face maybe."

You take account, now<br />

when we rise,<br />
with the will to discard our lives<br />
then you will confront the chain, the prison<br />

Here, right here, will be the Day of Reckoning.</p>

<p>Violence has erupted in Tahrir as I post this. Violence of Mubarak's goon squad on the peaceful demonstrators. Yet, Obama and Blair will continue to protect Mubarak. No matter, the will of the people of Egypt will prevail. </p>
