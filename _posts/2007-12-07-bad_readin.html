  content: ":)\r\n\r\nHey, next time, make sure to insert quotes from the Law of Manu:\r\n\r\n371.
    If a wife, proud of the greatness of her relatives or her own excellence, violates
    the duty which she owes to her lord, the king shall cause her to be devoured by
    dogs in a place frequented by many.\r\n\r\nAnd Bhagvad Gita, courtesy of \"His
    Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\" [sic]:\r\n\r\nChapter 1, Text
    40:\r\n\r\n\"The varnasrama religion's principles were so designed
    that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress
    of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness
    of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly
    very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection
    by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices,
    women will not be misled into adultery. According to Canakya Pandita, women are
    generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy....On the failure
    of such varnasrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with
    men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible
    men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human
    race at the risk of war and pestilence.\"\r\n\r\nChapter 16, Text 7:\r\n\r\n\"The
    demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be
    given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition
    of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life.
    She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband
    in her youth, and by the grown-up sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior
    according to the Manu-samhita. But modern education has artificially devised a
    puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an
    imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of women very good now.\""

  content: "\"What Desi Italiana has pasted above is the commentary by Prabhupada

    \"Purport\" sections. Thanks for pointing that out.\r\n\r\nMy view, however, is
    that his commentary is as good as the verses itself, because the purports are
    published in the \"Bhagvad Gita As It Is\" and this translation/version is widely
    circulated by ISKON throughout the US and elsewhere. And most people here in the
    US (esp. the converts) are most familiar with the ISKON book rather than, say,
    translations in other languages that are not accessible (nay, even unknown) to
    others."

    Bhagwad-Gita, as all other scriptures, suffers through translation, but even more
    so by commentaries which are tainted by the views of the commentator.   Most of
    the time, the commentator uses the opportunity to forward his own agenda and Prabhupada
    is not innocent in this regard.   Since he was the founder of ISKCON, his version
    would naturally be pushed by them.   Do not make the mistake of putting him on
    the same pedestal as the original writer of the scripture."

    I agree with you 100%. Which is why I said that his purports were as equally valid
    as the verses themselves to me, especially when there are millions of people reading
    the Bhagvad Gita who have very little training in Sanskrit. And it also needs
    to be pointed out that there are various translations of the Bhagvad Gita.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what for you is so fundamentally different in meaning from the verse which you
    quoted vs. the purport that I quoted?\r\n\r\n\"Do not make the mistake of putting
    him on the same pedestal as the original writer of the scripture.\"\r\n\r\nWho
    was the \"original writer\" of the scripture, in your opinion?\r\n\r\nAnd do you
    also feel that the quoted verse is an accurate rendering the verse in Sankrit?"

  content: "Who was the &ldquo;original writer&rdquo; of the

    one single writer, rather that it was polished/enhanced through various generations
    of teachers/masters, trying to point out the  moral/social goals they felt the
    masses should aspire to.   That of course would be tainted by prevalent social/moral
    values of their time.\r\n\r\nAnd do you also feel that the quoted verse is an
    accurate rendering the verse in Sankrit?\r\n\r\nNo, I do not.   But I am no Sanskrit
    scholar.\r\n\r\nBTW, what for you is so fundamentally different in meaning from
    the verse which you quoted vs. the purport that I quoted?\r\n\r\nThe original
    just states what it feels is a fact.   I could respect that as being a valid moral
    stance of that era.   While the purport uses it as a tool for preaching morality
    in this time and age."

    I could respect that as being a valid moral stance of that era. While the purport
    uses it as a tool for preaching morality in this time and age.\"\r\n\r\nI agree
    with this. \r\n\r\nPart of the reason (which I didn't state) I put up those quotes
    was to underline that texts like the Gita are also like the Bible and Koran--
    that those things were written in a historical context but are pushed as facts
    that should be adhered to in this day and age. Islam is by no means the only religion
    where this occurs. IMO, I see this as a common problem in all religions. \r\n\r\nAnd
    yet people keep harping on, and give space to, those who \"speak out against Islam,\"
    as if no other religion and religious communities have these problems. I would
    like to see more space devoted to fundamentalist issues not from the angle that
    Ali approaches (btw, I don't really like her angle), or Indian writers who continuously
    refer to Babri Masjid (for secularists, Babri is the symbolic origin of everything
    that has gone awry regarding communalism) to discuss Hindu fundamentalism, as
    well as religiously sanctified violence and dogmas today."
