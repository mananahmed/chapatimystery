  content: Ha. No. I have never been a member of ANY group. Funny that. I was just
    looking over the citizenship papers. Did you know that they ask you if you ever
    been a drunkard? [this apart from the old communist party question] The drunkard
    bit surprised me because they didn't ask if you were "convicted" of drunk driving
    but whether you were an alcoholic. Whaa? Why?

    amazingly, only 3 hits come up when googling "have you ever been a drunkard?" looking for further insight. 2 are CM.

    since i can only speculate (which tends to devolve to conspiracy theories), i bet it was a ploy to keep out the irish. or at least make us lie.

    that, or some relics of Prohibition may never die...

    I dunno about no K4r33n4 vidcaps, but I finally decided to do that billion horny boys' work and try to find said smut. desitorrents.com was the first google hit, and, ding ding ding, all the R1y4 S3n action a body could ask for, or something like that. Are the boys afraid of registering at dt?

    Since this is an open thread, I'm going to say that <a href="http://www.costaricanstore.com/detalleproducto.aspx?ID=1" rel="nofollow">Lizano brand salsa</a> is stupendously good and reminds me of the "chili sauce" we used to put on burgers in .au. That "chili sauce" is popular in .au is one of the charming quirks of empire.

    Dear Sepoy,

    Can you send the United States of my imagination back to me (I think I left it in the waiting room of the train station at about 3 p.m. on Thursday)?    I fear I have misplaced it--it's red, white, and blue, but is also nice to poor people and doesn't believe in constant structural discrimination for the benefit of a narrow economic elite!  If you should happen to come across a country where you're allowed to talk about national health care without being called a socialist because there are actual socialists who would be offended by the confusion, please let me know.  Thanks!

    <i>The reality, they assert, is grim and gruesome. Maybe they are right.</i>

    I think the trouble--which I'm sure you're aware of too--is that the reality and the ideals are not so neatly separable.  It took me a long time (until this week) to realize that perhaps the overemphasis on property rights and racism are highly intertwined with slavery (and similar practices) having been a crucial institution in the economy.  Which is to say: do the ideals we've been given come at the cost of other, better, more fruitful ideas?

  content: "<i> do the ideals we've been given come at the cost o  other, better,

    enlightenment. Perhaps correctly. As I grow older, I grow wary of revolutions,
    revolutionaries. They grow wary of systems that say you can choose any color as
    long as it is black. \nIdeals and realities are, indeed, not that far away. Idealists
    and realists, on the other hand...."

    A <i>real</i> revolutionary (I know some!--well, one anyway) understands that the key to any kind of social change in a system like this is to convince people (whoever those people are) of something even if it might imply other means or other tactics at particular points in time for particular purposes.  i.e. they're in it for the long haul, not some kind of Bernadine Dohrn school of scoial change. Vanguardism is a horrible way to go about things unless you're more interested in what you want, rather than what's best.

    In any case, regardless of whether you choose to be a pragmatist or an idealist, there are always intellectual options available to you that are more creative than the status quo (in ideals or policy choices).  It's really only when you put yourself in a position to be politically constrained by power relationships (i.e. you might lose your job) that you have something to lose by being creative about what you think and how you think it should be implemented.
