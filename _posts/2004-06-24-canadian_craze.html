  content: Bryan Adams is huge in India in general, but the current sothern wave probably
    has to do with his recent concert in Bangalore. Concerts by people who have topped
    American music charts are a rarity in India. Plus, his music aint bad.

  content: uh, didn't alanis spend a summer or two in south asia "finding herself"
    or something? she probably made a friend or three doing that. as for bryan adams,
    i got no clue. that's just sheer bad taste right there. would tablas make him
    better?

  content: Maybe it is some sort of sympathetic inferiority complex. Canada. Pakistan.
    India. Nuclear Weapons. Well, it sounded funny in my head.

  content: "Alanis writes a song entitled 'thank you India' and she's now a big hit
    in Pakistan?   I expect that in 2015, you'll be telling us how Avril Lavigne
    is huge in Sialkot."

  content: Hmmm ... before we dissect Morisette's 'Thank you' song for her India references,
    perhaps we should consider the possibility she was just high when she wrote the
    lyrics? The enlightening effects of pot make even the most mundane things in life
    like air and water take on new significance. So the inspiration in this case was
    probably not a higher state of being, but in actuality some 'good shit' she bought
    at the local head shop?

  content: "hey..BA is  hit in india cuz his music is good with easy to understand
    lyrics and tunes.So everytime he is in india there is no surprice really that
    people goes 2 watch him in thousands...Ans most of us indians dun really care
    if amarican charts toping artists wanna play here or not...only mere 10% indians
    actually listions to western music rest only listion to whatever is indian...
    \ \nand just to clear any misconception - to think there are as many Alanis fans
    in pak as there r in india of BA is foolish...tell me which artist considers pak
    as one of its music market?...\nAnd the lyrics of Thank You is pretty good if
    u can understand it,and if ur still puzled why wd she wanna thank india...then
    mate u'll  have to come down to india 2 find out"

<p>Blake informs me that Bryan Adams is HUGE in South India. Alanis Morisette is HUGE in Pakistan. Explain.</p>
