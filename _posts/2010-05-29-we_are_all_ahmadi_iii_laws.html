  content: Sara, there you go again, applying imperialist orientalist criteria to
    other cultures.....and in any case, this is a side show. The real issue is the
    oppression of the people by the puppet regime in Islamabad. By raising such issues
    you are playing into the hands of the metropole in its refusal of the categories
    of the imperial culture, its aesthetic, its illusory standard of normative or
    'correct' usage, and its assumption of a traditional and fixed meaning 'inscribed'
    in the words. Need I say more?

  content: "Interesting that the \"crime\" of calling their place of worship a mosque
    applies only to Ahmadis, not anyone else.  Then why is everyone in the media
    calling it \"Ahmadis' places of worship\"???"

  content: "I know and respect the anger and outrage against the latest  killing
    of Ahmadis and targeting of their places of worship.  I however ask respectfully,
    how is any of this new and different from the laws and treatment meted out
    to any other non Islamic  community in Pakistan?   For that matter, it
    is not any longer inconceivable that the constitution  will be amended one
    day to make Shia's official not muslim."

  content: "If I just read 298A in isolation, it strikes me as directed against Shiites
    rather than Ahmedis (since the target seems to be Shiites who criticize the first
    three/Sunni caliphs, or Bibi Ayesha).  On 298B, where is the provision that
    makes it punishable to call someone after Prophet Muhammad, a \"prophet\" (\"caliph\",
    \"Umm-ul-Mumineen\" etc. are all explicitly forbidden here) -- what am I missing?"
