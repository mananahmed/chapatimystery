    one of the advantages of digital collections [...]"

<p>You might have found out, by now, that Google has uploaded <a href="http://images.google.com/hosted/life">Life magazine's trove of photographs</a> from the 1860s onwards onto their formidable servers. They are of decent quality - with some tags/Labels. The viewer, of course, cannot add their own notations, labels and tags. ((If they did allow it, I could tell them that <a href="http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?imgurl=ed62e52a0efec378&q=kipling%27s+india+source:life&usg=__OFzl5k_oTwVlG4Q64zOfvJJqFbU=&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dkipling%2527s%2Bindia%2Bsource:life%26hl%3Den">the shopkeepers</a> are obviously not posing in front of their "spice store" but their local optician)) I would have liked to see this in Flickr with their level of user-interaction. These photos need metadata, folks. Us historians cannot make sense or teach from them, unless you let us interact with the metadata. Not to mention that I would have loved to see a "page scan" along with the photograph to get a sense of how these images were consumed upon initial reception. As it is, I am not even sure if the "Date taken" corresponds to the date of issue or not.</p>
<p>Still, some amazing South Asia stuff. <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Moslem+League%22&q=source%3Alife">Moslem League</a>, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=%22Muslim+League%22+source%3Alife&btnG=Search+Images">Muslim League</a>, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Mohammed+Ali+Jinnah+source:life">Jinnah</a>, and most intriguingly, <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=kipling%27s+india+source%3Alife">Kipling's India</a>. </p>
<p>Some newfound favorites:</p>
