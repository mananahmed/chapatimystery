  content: "This photo is incredibly similar to one published in my grand mother's
    family history book, supposedly scanned from the original.  Ghalib was related
    by marriage to the Loharo family to which my maternal grand mother belongs.  The
    links below are scans from that book named \"Khandan-e-Loharo\" by Tahira Bano.
    \ I am not an expert in photography, but I think the photo in the book is retouched
    or entirely hand drawn.  A comparison shows that both are very similar but
    not exactly.  A slight crack across the forehead in the Loharo photo is captured
    in the scan, something that is not found in the scan posted by Sepoy.  Also the
    face is slightly more elongated in Sepoy's photo.  http://www.ezdoc.net/faraz/ghalib_small.png http://www.ezdoc.net/faraz/ghalib.png"

  content: whenever i read him i feel sad very sad.How on earth a man of his calibre
    could live so little.He wanted the world in his lifetime and he knew he was the
    best yet no one, except few, could understand him.I guess pain do bring the best
    in men of letter.But for him the end was too much.I was very surprised to read
    abouthim in a religious book, tazkara ie ghausia, where the Ghaus Ali Shah Sahib,the
    Qalandar, admired him as a excellent humanbeing and a fanatastic poet.What a pity
    every thing had to end.

    often ... but the photograph of Hargopal Tufta or Tafta as he was called ... the
    formost shagird of Ghalib ... some very beautiful letters were written by Ghalib
    to Tufta his student ... in one of the letters he mentions that Tufta is writing
    too much ... literally thousands of verses ... but with no quality ... and if
    he continues to do so ... i will not correct them hence forth ... Tufta remained
    loyal to Ghalib till the end ... always worried about his mastre's health and
    the monitory conditions ... further in those troubled times a great example of
    hindu muslim unity ..."

  content: i heard that Ghalib never gave any photograph but a portrait was drawn
    by artist few months before his death, he was so weak and hardly manage to gave
    enough time for portrait. The artist manage to draw sorrow and weakness on his
    face. This is the only Portrait we have on Ghalib. This all i read in an article
    some 15 years back in "The Hindu"  Delhi  Edition .

<p>With thanks to Francesca Orsini, Alok Rai and his family, and Fran Pritchett, we have a scan of the only photo portrait of Mirza Asadullah Ghalib. Incredible.<br />
