  content: But that would be imperialist, and that would be Wrong.   It might be nice
    if people realised that South Asia in the 21st C is not Latin America is the 70s,
    and never was.  For that matter, Latin America is no longer Latin America in the
    70s.

  content: 'Yeah, the framing of this NYT article, though reasonably well-researched
    and -written, was all kinds of disturbing.  This is the teaser: "The Obama administration
    must decide whether Nawaz Sharif is likely to be a reliable ally or an obstructionist
    force."  What is the force of that "must decide"?  What is the implied action
    embodied in that decision?'

  content: "It would be a million times better if the US embassy's only help was to
    keep the army from intervening on the side of Zardari (in some kind of half-assed
    scheme to keep the civilians divided and powerless) and to let MQM know that reasonable
    coexistence within Pakistani law is in their interest. That is one favor the US
    embassy does owe the people of Pakistan, given their role in making these powers
    grow out of control. If they can do that and keep as far away from Nawaz Sharif
    and other politicians (at least in public) as possible, they will help themselves
    and (more important) will help the people of pakistan. Their micromanagement has
    brought the country to the edge of total ruin already and any more inspired creative
    thinking from Anne Patterson sahiba will be the end of us...."

  content: "I also think  a violent endgame is approaching for this jihadi operation.
    I say this because of these inter-related thoughts: 1. The Pak army's hardcore
    jihadi wing used to be the only people in the army with a clear vision of what
    they want. The other officers (who were probably always in the \"silent\" majority)
    were kept in line with talk of Islam and India and a few elementary conspiracy
    theories (no one ever lost mony betting against the IQ of the army high command,
    so this was never a difficult operation), and of course, the \"commercial plots\"
    and other goodies that were always available (and under Musharraf, the literally
    uncounted dollars that flowed in). But you cant fool all the people all the time.
    Even the American embassy (whose intelligence gathering seems to have been at
    the mess gossip level for most of our history) finally got a clue. Now the double
    game has become practically impossible. A choice has to be made and some officers
    (maybe including the current chief?) seem to have made the \"unislamic\" choice
    and are working against the jihadi network. They will even abandon the \"kashmir
    jihad\", which used to be the way people like Musharraf were convinced to keep
    the jihadi ball rolling for so many years. 2. More and more civilians within
    Pakistan (especially in Punjab and Sindh) are beginning to see that the jihadi
    operation and their own lifestyle are not compatible and one or the other will
    have to go. And it wont be about cosmetic stuff like putting burqas on your wives.
    Its about who has the power to get things done and who gives orders and who has
    to obey (notice who just grabbed the emerald mines in Swat). There is still a
    market for confusing conspiracy theories but the tide is clearly turning. It is
    easy to see that MQM has no interest in a jihadi victory, but I think even PMLN
    is crystal clear about what will happen to them after the holy ones are in charge.
    These civilian forces have no direct control over the jihadis in the \"intelligence\"
    agencies, but they change public opinion and the army rank and file is not immune
    to public opinion. 3. The drone war is going to heat up and senior jihadis
    will need shelter deeper within Pakistan. Even if the Americans are looking for
    an exit, they will still press for action in Pakistan and with more civilian support
    and increasing support from the non-jihadi sections of the army, they will find
    some of these jihadis. The jihadis will have to fight against the mainstream army
    and the civilian security agencies. Even with continued support and management
    from the jihadi section of the intelligence agencies, this conflict cannot be
    kept in safe bounds. The clash will become more violent and less controlled. Both
    sides will have to go for broke. What do you think?"

  content: "<i>and of course, the same kind of cartoon could be made about Zulfi Bhutto

    and Oranges. Zulfi Bhutto is very critical of Gen Ayub but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/18/world/defiant-pakistani-crowd-marks-first-anniversary-of-zia-s-death.html?sec=&amp;spon=\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Nawaz Sharif celebrated Gen Zia death anniversary with lot of
    pride</a>, stark difference. Why people become senseless in criticizing PPP hope
    it's not because the most PPP voters are from lower to lower
    middle class (read illiterate) and hence not many supporters in media?  <i>Daily
    Times is owned by Salman Taseer</i>  Still that cartoon counts and I actually
    support competition among different political view like this as it is quite healthy
    just like US. Of course without going over board. Any idea who owns Geo TV because
    <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cmg2PosfuI&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">clowns
    like this are giving Pakistan bad name</a>. I don't like it when people say Geo
    is owned by Punjabi conservatives."

    can understand your displeasure but what can you expect when in our beloved country
    there is no economic development and educational effort due to numerous reasons.
    The only time Pakistan really stray away from US was during Zulfi Bhutto rule
    but again then he should have hanged few Army officials for the crimes they did
    in other half of the country.  Our Army and Civil servants are too corrupt, politicians
    are just same as every where."

  content: "On the intersection of U.S. policy and Pakistani politics, I was particularly
    surprised to read this link off a Pakistani news twitter feed:  ----- Obama
    calls Zardari, discusses mutual cooperation Pakistan News.Net / Friday 27th
    March, 2009 (ANI) http://www.pakistannews.net/story/482750  Islamabad,
    Mar. 27 : US President Barack Obama telephoned President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday
    to discuss mutual cooperation and the situation in the South Asian region. Obama
    and Zardari spoke about the \"Friends of Democratic Pakistan\" forum initiative,
    aimed at promoting and strengthening democracy in Pakistan, The Nation reports...  ...Zardari,
    who launched the initiative of 'Friends of Democratic Pakistan' (FODP) in New
    York in September 2008, will chair the Friends' Ministerial meeting being held
    in Tokyo on April 17. The forum consists of 25 countries and multilateral institutions
    including US, UK, China, EU, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Republic of
    Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, Nordic countries, UN, World Bank, Asian Development
    Bank and Islamic Development Bank. -----  What is the \"Friends of Democratic
    Pakistan\" forum, and why is Zardari chairing it?   Given that Zardari was
    opposed to an independent judiciary, and given that Zardari had to step back from
    a repressive attempt to shut down the recent Long March, I'm surprised to read
    that U.S. President Obama was actually chatting with him about this forum.  On
    the one hand, I can understand that if one is to channel development aid into
    Pakistan (which the U.S. apparently is going to start emphasizing), one needs
    to do that through that nation's head of state. And Zardari is still the president.
    But on the other hand, given his obvious anti-democratic actions, it is disappointing
    that the Obama Administration appears to be lending its implicit support to him
    by talking to him in the context of his \"Friends of Democratic Pakistan\" forum.  This
    appears to be related to the \"concerns\" from Washington about Nawaz Sharif as
    an effective \"partner\" for dealing with the Taliban.  My fear is that the U.S.
    may be indirectly attempting to boost the legitimacy of Zardari, despite his authoritarian
    leanings.  This approach might help the U.S. get a more pliant \"partner\"
    for dealing with the Taliban in the short term, but it isn't helpful to Pakistan's
    democracy in the long run."

  content: Most certainly, Pakistan in the 21st C is not Latin America is the 70s.
    Latin America in the 1970s had a real organized left prepared to resist the reactionary
    forces backed by the United States. Pakistan today has no such thing and that's
    where the problem begins, not to mention that the United States today is - however
    tepidly, inadequately, and temporarily - militarily opposed to the most reactionary
    political forces in South and Central Asia.
