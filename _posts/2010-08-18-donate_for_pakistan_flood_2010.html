<p>You should also see the <a href="http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/pakistan-floods-2010-country-aid-factsheet-1010.html">Donor Factsheet</a> on Pakistan by Global Humanitarian Fund which dramatically highlights how <em>little</em> humanitarian aid actually flows into Pakistan from "official" sites. Which is what makes efforts, such as this, relying on individuals donating to international or national organizations all the more valuable. </p>
<p>Spread the word. Donate. Please.</p>
