<p><b>very related</b>: Interview with <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2006/05/ifbook_in_library_journal.html">If:book's Ben</a> in <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/CA6332156.html">Library Journal</a>: "Soon, books will literally have discussions inside of them, both live chats and asynchronous exchanges through comments and social annotation". I literally said this at <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/julia.html">Julia Flanders</a> talk on Thursday. Except by discussion I mean commentaries. More on this soon. Much, much more. </p>
