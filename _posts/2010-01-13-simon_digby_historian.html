  content: Sad news indeed. He could walk into a monument in Delhi and date it by
    the rhetoric of its Persian inscriptions and put scholars everywhere in awe of
    himself by his knowledge of sources in Persian, Hindi, Urdu and Nepali. He must
    be one of the last of those Brits who "stayed on" in India. Well, almost.

  content: He was an original.  We are diminished by his passing and shall not see
    his like again.  He was born in India and now he has died there.  He preferred
    being in India to being anywhere else.  According to his friend Richard Harris,
    he will be cremated tomorrow or Thursday and as he requested his ashes will be
    "immersed in the flowing water of a river".  The world won't be the same without
    him.

  content: "I just wanted to add a few thoughts of my own on Simon Digby. I got to
    know him some time in the late 1980s or about 1990 in Delhi. I think it was initially
    through Muzaffar, since he used to visit Muzaffar and Rizwana regularly in Dakshinapuram.
    I remember having a discussion on Mutribi Samarqandi's text
    with him, and Simon's extempore recitation of Persian verses
    on the subject of  khatt-i-sabz (&ldquo;down just appearing upon
    the cheek&rdquo;), a subject that features in Mutribi's
    encounters with Jahangir. Simon was of course a marvelous eccentric. He collected
    material over a very curious range of subjects and had the most amazing memory.
    David Shulman recalls (as a Ph.D. student at SOAS) being guided by him over the
    premises of the Royal Asiatic Society and being given the most precise explanations
    of every conceivable object, nook and cranny. He also collected objects, manuscripts,
    pan-holders and so on. I never visited him in Jersey, but Muzaffar (who has) remembers
    the dazzling array of objects as well as the fact that he began each morning listening
    to qawwali and bhajans.\r\n \r\nWe once went on a trip to Senji fort in Tamilnadu
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; David, Narayana Rao, Simon and I &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in
    January 1997 while on our way from Chennai to a conference in Pondicherry (where
    he presented his great paper on Lodi-period historiography). By the time we got
    to the fort, it was almost dusk and the chowkidars warned us to be careful. But
    Simon scuttled off with his stout walking stick and we could hardly keep up with
    him. All of a sudden, he disappeared from sight and there was a loud crash. Simon
    had fallen into an underground granary. The distressed chowkidars shone their
    torches down and there he was, sitting up and blinking at the bottom of the treacherous
    stairs. &ldquo;Mein bilkul thik hun&rdquo;, he insisted,
    refusing to acknowledge that they only spoke Tamil in those parts. And off he
    was a few minutes later. I have a very funny photograph from that visit that shows
    him peeking out mischievously from behind a temple pillar between Narayana Rao
    and me.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1990s, we spoke briefly of collaborating on travel
    accounts, which Muzaffar and I were also working on by then. But eventually that
    turned out not to be feasible. Simon wanted to publish annotated translations
    and we were after something else. Eventually, we decided on a sort of division
    of labour. One of the last offprints he sent me was his translation of the Hajj
    sections of Bayazid Beg's account from the late sixteenth century.
    He was going to publish his translation of Azfari's travels,
    and so we decided to stay with the sections of the Waqiat-i-Azfari having to do
    with Delhi and Lucknow.\r\n\r\nSimon had an acute sense that there were very few
    people in the British academy who shared his interest in Persian and vernacular
    materials for historical (rather than purely literary) purposes. By the 1960s,
    almost everyone there in history was working exclusively on English-language materials.
    He could really find kindred spirits there only amongst the art-historians. This
    was one of the reasons &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; besides a common interest in Aurangabad
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that he took greatly to Nile Green and kept in touch with
    him in recent years. He therefore gravitated from the late 60s to people elsewhere,
    Marc Gaborieau in Paris, Yohanan Friedmann in Jerusalem, John Richards and others
    in the US. In India, he was for a time close to Iqtidar Alam Khan to whom he dedicated
    his 'Warhorse and Elephant' (if I am not
    mistaken). It was his only full-fledged attempt at a monograph so far as I know.
    His preferred mode of expression was the essay, and he also liked to return to
    his essays, and polish them, once, twice and thrice. He had done extensive revisions
    to his Dattu Sarvani articles from the mid 1960s, amongst a whole host of other
    things by him that await publication. I hope his many friends &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    Shahid Amin, Muzaffar Alam, Sunil Kumar, and so many others &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    will collaborate to bring these out.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts. I think Shahid
    and others will write at greater length."

  content: "I met Simon on a train going from Pakistan to Iran in 1965 and we both
    watched the goings on every time the train was stopped for 'inspections' by various
    'authorities'. He explained that the 'authorities' were selling the clothing back
    to those who were wearing more than they needed. Apparently they were taking the
    clothes to Iran to sell for a profit and the 'inspections' were in fact a local
    and unofficial tax'. \r\nUpon arrival in Esfahan we spent some time going around
    the historic buildings and he translated old old old bits of engraving here and
    there. I was impressed - so much so that I began to learn classical Greek a few
    months later in Greece. (eventually an A level)"

    he became and remained a dear and treasured friend. He could be as exasperating
    as anyone I have ever met, but he was always generous to a fault and excelent
    company. I miss him greatly.

  content: "I got to know Simon when he was in his last year at Trinity Cambridge
    where he was reading history. He told me that his tutor told him that he had a
    chance of getting a first class honours degree if he stopped \"messing about learning
    Arabic.\"  Simon paid no attention to his tutor and  continued with his Arabic.
    When Simon got his first class degree in history his turor was so angry that he
    cut him when he passed him in the street. \r\nI knew little of his academic side
    but he was a wonderful friend. He was an affectionate and amusing friend and the
    most unselfish person I have even known. I shall miss that braying voice and his
    extraordinary laughter. He used to stay sometimes with us in London, always bringing
    an original and fascinating present such as a little silver box with a cabochon
    amethyst on the lid or a Russian wooden box with unused Victorian stamps and an
    ancient  'thruppenny' bus ticket. He was the only Englishman I knew who noticed
    any jewellery  one was wearing. And he made the best duck pilaf I have ever eaten.
    Once I asked his advice for buying a carpet. Instead of overwhelming me with art-historiacl
    details he said typically: \"It's very easy to choose a good carpet; if you like
    it you'll get it right.\""

  content: I lived in Simon's home on Burchington Rd, London for about 2 years  from
    1977 - 1979.  I was responsible for taking care of Simon's rooftop appartment.  I
    lived downstairs.  I throughly enjoyed spending time in Simon's apartment, looking
    through all the wonderful books, manuiscripts, and enjoying the wonderful art
    he had around the apartment.  Simon travelled allot and I took care of his mail
    while he was away.  He called me one day and asked me to look for a book that
    was somewhere in his living room, I found the book on the floor by the telephone.  Simon
    called me back to see if I had found the book, I told him I had and he told me
    that someone would call me and arrange to pick it up.  A few day's later the book
    was picked-up by a very well dressed woman in a very fancy car.  When Simon returned
    a month or so later he told me the story about the book.  I loved Simons stories
    and enjoyed when he had friends visit.  I also made a trip to Jersey and visited
    him in the house owned at that time by his aunt.  The visit to his aunts house
    was majicial, a wonderful day.  I was so sad to read of Simon's death today.  However,
    I was glad to know that Simon had known for such a short time that he was ill.  I
    know how much he loved India and hope that he is at peace.  thanks for the memories

Anyone who has touched any scholarly/popular work on medieval to colonial India - esp. aspects of religion and art - has seen the fruits of his amazing intellect reflected in those works. </p>
<p>I will try and find a full biography but let me note the following from on-line sources:</p>
<blockquote><p>SIMON DIGBY is a former fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford and a former assistant keeper in the Department of Eastern Art, the Ashmolean Museum. He continues to serve as honorary Librarian of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, a position he has held since 1971. The foremost British scholar of pre-Mughal India, he has written numerous foundational essays on Indo-Persian Sufism as well as contributing to The Cambridge Economic History of India, volume 1.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In 1919 the Royal Asiatic Society established a formal lecture in the name of Sir Richard Burton, the British traveller, scholar and translator. In 1923 it decided to bestow a medal upon the lecturer. The recipient of the medal is required to have been not just a dry-as-dust scholar but someone who has actually engaged, as Burton did, with Asian societies in the field. Among recipients of the medal have been St John Philby and Freya Stark, both renowned for their Arabian explorations, and more recently W.G. Archer, the Indian Civil Servant who collected Indian village songs and tribal art as well as introducing courtly traditions in the visual arts to the general public, and David Snellgrove, the scholar-traveller in the Hindu-Buddhist worlds of South and Southeast Asia. In 1999 Simon Digby, the scholar of Indian Sufism, was the Burton lecturer. </p></blockquote>
<p>And his <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=author%3A%22Simon+Digby%22&btnG=Search&as_sdt=2001&as_ylo=&as_vis=0">list of publications</a>. </p>
<p>A great loss.</p>
<p><b>update</b>: More details on his life and times appear in <em>Indian Express</em>: <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-a-lifetime-loving-india-historian-digby-breathes-his-last-in-delhi/566286/0">After a lifetime loving India, historian Digby breathes his last: in Delhi</a> (<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/after-a-lifetime-loving-India.pdf">pdf</a>). He was truly the last great orientalist (it is high time to reclaim that word from Said).</p>
