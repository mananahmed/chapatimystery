  content: "The only trouble is that Salman Ahmad, an otherwise intelligent guy, refuses
    to admit that he just CAN'T sing... if he is so hell bent on continuing with Junoon,
    why can't he recruit a new singer from the army of Ali Azmat wannabees around?
    Their differences aside, why can't he convince Ali Azmat himself to share the
    stage, even if they aren't on talking terms off stage?\r\n\r\nBut no... \"Alwidaaa...\",
    he continues to wail... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaxSoNoHIWg"

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2009/01/picture-1.png" alt="picture-1" title="picture-1" height="102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3613" />I am pretty sure that the <a href="http://jaipurliteraturefestival.org/">Jaipur Literary Festival</a> is a mela that I need to be at. </p>
<p>I can't be, but please go and rub shoulders with the likes of the Rudolphs, Wendy, Dalrymple et. al. In fact, William Dalrymple & Namita Gokhale are the creative directors. The festival will be held from 21st to 25th January 2009, at the <a href="http://www.hoteldiggipalace.com/">Diggi Palace</a> in Jaipur. </p>
<p>Of special note, Junoon Unplugged- Salman Ahmad and the "Sufi Qawwali Experience Live". It is heartening to see that even as bombs are breaking down habitations, we can tie new bonds in other places. </p>
