  content: I read that article he wrote when he was on that flight with Nawaz Sharif
    - it was god-awful and there was just no defending it. This is a shame, I liked
    French's book "Liberty or Death" which I think took a relatively balanced view
    of the Indian independence movement and partition. I have heard him speak and
    talked to him a few times; he is one of the few people interested in the region
    who isn't Indo-centric in his approach - what struck me at the time was his insistence
    that Pakistan was the most interesting country in the region and the one he wanted
    to concentrate on/spend time in. It is a shame that it led to this, since he is
    one of the relatively small number of sympathetic external observers Pakistan
    has.

    still have popular support to <b>unite with progressive elements inside the Army</b>,

  content: "Hi,  I suspect I fall into your category of people who are basically
    pro-Indian.  Of course, some Indians have denounced me as pro-Pakistani, so who
    knows?  That said, the New York Times has to find people whose positions
    can be understood without reading a fair amount about Pakistan.    The situation
    in Pakistan is actually very confusing, with conflicts between big landowners
    and capitalists out of the Western early 19th century superimposed on conflicts
    between religious fanatics and the traditional landowning aristocracy right out
    of the Western late middle ages.   To add to the confusion, Pakistan's army promoted,
    back in the eighties, a Saudi inspired form of religious fanaticism, because this
    form of Islam tends to set Pakistan apart from India.  As I understand it, this
    form of Islam has continued to be the semi-official preferred form.  At the same
    time, the army is in many ways an independent power, capable of vetoing decisions
    by other actors on the political stage, if one is to believe Ayesha Siddiqa.  All
    of this is happening in a country that speaks four different languages, which
    seem at this  distance to support four different political cultures.  Both the
    Pashtuns and the Balochs seem to have substantial independence movements, with
    the Pashtun independence types allied to the Taliban.  All this before you
    start to figure out India, the ISI, etc.  Even Pakistanis have a lot of
    trouble figuring out Pakistan.  I usually believe Tariq Ali, but that is just
    to provide me with a starting point in figuring things out.  Which is to
    say that it is much easier to adopt currently fashionable attitudes in the US
    than it is to figure out Pakistan.  So in a short piece, the NYT pretty much has
    to do that.  If you're interested in my blog, it is at:  http://www.rememberjenkinsear.blogspot.com/  but
    I must confess, I haven't figured out Pakistan yet:-).  Ray,"

  content: Bilal, I see where you're coming from on the Chopra post (the irritating
    salman ahmed's a co-author), but on balance I would say this sort of piece is
    a lot more welcome than the sort that typically appears -- I think of Bernard
    Henri-Levi and his representations of Pakistan as a breathlessly insane place
    (where it's always night) as the patron saint of the latter sort of piece.  At
    least the Chopra/Ahmed piece is trying to explore some nuances, for an audience
    that likely isn't going otherwise hear/read about them...

    in Swat - its because they agree with the basic philosophy of the Taliban.

  content: 'M: I don''t think that necessarily follows; the insurgency in Nagaland
    has continued basically from 1948; Mizoram from 1961 or so; surely we couldn''t
    infer from this that the Indian army "agree(s) with the basic philosophy" of the
    Naga or Mizo secessionists, would we?  Even far more sophisticated militaries
    than India''s or Pakistan''s, such as the US'' or UK''s, find it very difficult
    to tackle guerilla insurgencies (the relative success in Iraq is due in large
    part to the fact that the US is basically paying tribesmen in the "Sunni triangle"
    to not fight; i.e. it isn''t just a function of military tactics; and even that
    stage took half a decade to reach.  Afghanistan remains a mess 7+ years after
    the fall of the Taliban government in Kabul; heck even historically it took British
    forces a decade to tackle the Malay insurgency in the 1950s, and Indochina proved
    problematic for both France and the USA;  Algeria was another one; I mean there
    are countless examples)...'

<p>Re: Patrick French. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/opinion/17french.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">"Touting Religion, Grabbing Land.</a>" <i>New York Times</i>, March 17, 2009.</p>
<p>It has been a while since CM had a rant post. I have matured, you know. Elevated discourse and all that. But, fuck it. This Patrick French "opinion piece" just fills me with that oft-familiar feeling. </p>
<p>First off, does Patrick French meet our criteria of having access to NYT Op-ed. Yes, he does. He is qualified because he is "the author, most recently, of &ldquo;The World Is What It Is: The Authorized Biography of V. S. Naipaul.&rdquo; Excellent. </p>
<p>Next, does he know some really important people? Like, personally? Yes, he does. <i>I flew to Islamabad with Nawaz Sharif</i>. More excellence. How about native informants? <i>my brother-in-law, Sana Ullah</i>. Hooked up! </p>
<p>Further, does he have the requisite millenarian, apocalyptic understanding of Pakistan? Is he convinced that the End Is Nigh? Yes he does! Notice that in his very first line, "<i>the demonstrations across Pakistan last week that forced President Asif Ali Zardari to reinstate the nation's former chief justice, following the attack by militants on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, were simply the latest phase in the broad destabilization of the country,</i>" he manages to put a broad-based populist movement on equal footing with a terrorist attack and have _both_contribute to the doom. Well played, French. Well played. </p>
<p>It is a dispiriting read. In French's view, 18 months ago was a rosy-paradise when Mush ruled the roost and he could sip bubblies with Mian ji. But, a dinner conversation and a teenage boy changed all that. Note the burden of proof he has to muster for this piece to get published in NYT: a dinner conversation with the in-laws, and an un-named teenage boy. Bravo, NYT. But, this absurdly low bar exists only when one is talking about those brown people over there. I bet if some Parisian soul submitted a broad jeremiad on US financial meltdown after exchanging a few sentences with her waitress, she'd get rejected. Well, maybe, if she was the author, most recently, of <i>Living with Jonathan: That Littell Shit</i>, they'd consider it.</p>
<p>The "analysis" goes beyond being hackneyed  (according to my estimation, the first use of "failed state" in reference to Pakistan was used in 1953) and into complete and utter cluelessness. Take a look: </p>
<blockquote><p>Pakistan's slide toward anarchy is similar to the conditions in Afghanistan in the 1990s: it was easier then for the Afghan elite to pretend that the political situation was likely to improve than to face the truth and do something about it. The bickering factions in Kabul allowed the Taliban to take control of large areas of southern Afghanistan, refusing to see that this would only embolden the Islamists to march on the capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>Count the ways in which this is patently absurd. Afghanistan in the 1990s was a decade after a foreign occupation and pitched battle in every "hamlet" (to use Senator Kerry's formulation). Is he seriously comparing the current state of Pakistan to Afghanistan? By that equivalence, is Musharraf's period akin to Soviet occupation. Hey, I can dig it, but that does clash w/ his previously "Oh how nice things were 18 months ago" scenario. I won't even point out how patently wrong he is in reading Afghanistani history, alone. It wasn't "bickering" that led to the fall of Kabul at the hands of the Taliban in 1996, that's for certain. </p>
<p>The sheer hyperbolic madness of "killing fields" "radical sunni groups are more powerful than ever", "deal with Taliban represents most serious blow to the country's territorial integrity since the civil war of 1971" numbs the mind. However, here is what I think is the gem. The one pure insight that he gets so completely wrong that it circles around one's logic and becomes right again: <i>The army has limited skill in counterinsurgency tactics or in winning hearts and minds; its main achievement over the last two decades has been training militants to fight Indian troops in Kashmir.</i> So the army which trained and equipped and marshaled hundreds of thousands of Afghanistani counterinsurgents over a decade of fighting the Soviets has limited skills? The army which spread a hardline, fundamentalist, aggressively confrontational religiosity across the nation-state for more than a decade doesn't know about winning hearts and minds? </p>
<p>What a crock.</p>
