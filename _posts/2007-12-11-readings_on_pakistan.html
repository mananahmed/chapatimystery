  content: That is truly a treat. Thanks a lot for that. The last comment is quite
    valid as there is gem of fiction literature on the partition. One may include
    a selection of short stories by Manto and the progressive writer's tribe on subjects
    related to partition.

    histories, at best, with scarcely any social or cultural or regional history;
    they rarely incorporate any vernacular sources (even Urdu sources, for that matter);
    and typically adhere to the conventional "failed state" model. One cannot find
    any monographs say on the history of the Left or gender or city. It is slim pickings
    out there.'

  content: "Abir:  \"What is a sub-nationalism? A nationalism opposed to a nationalism?
    A nationalism less than a nationalism?\"  That's an excellent question,
    when you think about it. My first impulse was to say that it is more regional
    and ethnic based, but then you could say the same about nationalism. I suppose
    in this context, \"sub-nationalism\" might be that which is within the overriding
    nationalism of the nation state (Pakistan), and one that could or could not be
    in defiance of this larger nationalism.  Or maybe Sepoy wants to elaborate..."

    nation-state nationalisms are composed of linguistic, regional, and ethnic threads
    as well, no?  And even with nation-state nationalism, it's not like there
    is one hegemonic and monolithic nationalism (ie \"the hegemonic nation-state nationalism\").
    There are various nation-state nationalismS, which I think compete one another
    and jostle with one another. Like with India, there are different kinds and conceptualizations
    of nationalism..."

  content: "Thanks, Desi Italiana and Sepoy for your thoughts.  In Delhi, I
    had often heard this political science term come up in boring Conferences on Kashmir,
    Assam and Nagaland in the early 1990s. But it has been given up (even by political
    scientists&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;things changed so rapidly in the 1990s)&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    so I hardly expected to come across it on CM. The adherents of different subnationalisms
    might feel provoked into saying, Uski kameez meri kameez se safed kaise. I don't
    know if there is a more recent citation for the concept. My feeling is that it
    has long been given up even by political scientists.  Why not call ethnic,
    regional, linguistic nationalisms by their names&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;Balochi,
    Assamese, Sindhi, Kashmiri? The &ldquo;sub-&rdquo; is unnecessary
    because sometimes these nationalisms might be working with what you call &ldquo;the
    hegemonic nation-state nationalism.&rdquo; Something is lost with the
    \"sub-\"...more so when all these movements have their own histories."

<p>I am often asked to write up a single post on the broad overview of the history of Pakistan - and I usually say: I am a medievalist. Part of the frustration is, of course, that there isn't anything notable out there which covers the politics, history and culture in around 200 pages for the general audience. No, Ian Talbot and Stephen Cohen are not up to the task - neither are any books that have any of the following words in their title: Military, Extremism, Mosque. Such books may or may not be good reading on those specific topics, but they fail miserably at everything else. Until the time that a money-hungry Press asks me for the manuscript that will land them on the best seller's list (Sepoy's Pakistan: Mad Mutterings of the Melancholic Sort), the best "book" on Pakistan is a series of readings. I am providing a partial listing from a class I taught. The list is by no means meant to be taken as exhaustive, comprehensive or even exemplary. The main selection criteria was the availability of materials in pdf format. There are also other pedagogical quirks buried here. I pay as much attention to historiography as to history in my selection of readings and I also like to assign readings that will provoke my students, rather than simply inform them. In that, I often tend to assign materials that do not share my own outlook or with which I have substantial issues. That said, if you read these 30 odd articles, book reviews, etc., I promise you will be totally prepared for anything a Fareed Zakaria or a Tom Friedman can conjure. </p>

<p><b>update</b>: Since 2007, some new titles worth adding: Ayesha Siddiqa's Military, Inc, Iftikhar Dadi's Modernism and the Art of Muslim South Asia, Naveeda Khan and Veena Das' Beyond Crisis: Re-evaluating Pakistan and the forthcoming volumes by Saadia Toor, Kamran Asdar Ali and, um, me.</p>
