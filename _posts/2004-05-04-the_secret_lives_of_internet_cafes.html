    Did i give that impression? Filtering and monitoring are NOT the solution at all. Hmmm... re-reading the post, i guess, i should have made clear that there was derision in my tone.
    Censoring or monitoring the internet will not deter this crime. Having responsible laws of privacy will - that and some responsible computing by the populace.

  content: Pak gov. (PTA) must implement a law for the cyber cafe's in the country.
    There should be some standards provided by that gov. for cyber cafe's design.
    I think we (private sector) should take some step for creating a body for controlling
    cybernet in the country.

    salamzZ!
    i have seen everybody sayin that these cafes haf destroyed many houses n many girls haf commited suicide so these cafes should be banned 0r looked by authorities...n bla bla...
        But juz think if ur wife 0r sis. wud haf been their in dat cafe n u didnt knew abt it ur entire life n suddenly u know abt it...u wud haf certainly killed her for betrayin u or for doin such thins....so i think their is no fault of these cafe walas infact is the fault of these ever betrayin gals...
    Any wayz wat i want to suggest is dat by promotin these cafe's into media 0r where ever possible (not promoting to bann the cafes) we can gain sumthin i.e the gals 0r the persons goin in cafe's will alwayz be aware of such activities by cafes(that their pics 0r photos can also becum public)which will stop them from doin such shameful acts.They will never even think of doin such thins n also they wudnt even think of visitin any nude site.They also will prefer usin their own PC's and may be startin using PC'S for sumthin more informative. And by this we will help our society in preventing all such non-acceptable deeds, which wud help a great deal in building a better society.....
    Many of u wud disagree but consider sum1 close to u doin these shameful acts may be then u will change ur mind.........

    Sepoy: Can your wife or sister kill you, if you are caught betraying their honor?
    Ejaz: *deeply impressed*
    On Talha Iqbal: why everyone's so power hungry anyway? Either government controls it or private sector or both? Whose property is cyberworld anyway? Yeah, regulating cyber cafes and issuing licenses is a decent enough suggestion and that's something we can back but not convert into legislation without government's willingness (thankfully, there does seem some ray of light). And while we are there, we have even bigger problems: Our ISPs' inadequate responses to combat Spam to be on top of my wishlist. Interestingly, while we shouldn't expect them to combat SPAM or junkmail, we can at least expect them to have their servers cleaned from these viruses, worms and other crap. WorldCall who invested millions of rupees building and creating a fibre-optic broadband providing company is deeply infected with viruses on its "pirated network" not only that their lawless networks keep an eye no one can stand. Smaller companies have even bigger problems. The end result for me is that I should sit silently and communicate with as many users/customers I can, in my own capacity, and discuss with them various issues/scenarios attached with online world and those who provide/bring this service.

  content: This is so disturbing and upsetting. The solution is not to ban pornographic
    sites. The people who are photographing and videotaping such things are sick minded
    people. They have no honor and no respect neither for themselves, their mother
    and sisters and wife and nor those of others. People, this is a muslim country.
    Does it look like one? I feel so ashamed of my fellow country men. People who
    committed sin of adultery, that is their act and Allah will punish them if He
    wants. It does not give anyone right to extort those families. Of course, I do
    condemn having sex in cyber cafes and adultery as well, but regulating internet
    sites is not the solution here. The problem is far bigger and worse than controlling
    access to obscene site.

    Hi everybody!
    It is really difficult to wrie or say about what happened in Rawalpindi. I wonder how girls and boys are crazy about sex. No doubt, everybody likes it but it should be done according to our religion and after marriages. By chance my cousin got the CD. Oh my God, that was worst. I wonder how young girls were sitting with their boyfriends and doing unexplainable. Trust me few of them were in scarves and gowns (usually a symbol of nobility. One guy was doing un natural thing with a school girl. Some out of you must be thinking that i am enjoying writing this. I swear i just want to let you know that take care of your daughters. I read some females gave comments like this "Can your wife or sister kill you, if you are caught betraying their honor?". Listen sir/madam will you allow your daughter, sister or mother doing this, never. For such fuck ups death is the only punishment. I am sure after this incident a lot of girls will avoid making boyfriends as this is a craze these days. Anyway this what i think you may differ it. Love, Aamer

    sorry for the girls who committed suicide after their noble deeds were disclosed....shame on their parents who let loose their daughters with their boyfriends.....we are muslims and any such act will produce this kind of serious repercussions........being an islamic country our govt should immediately ban all porno sites to avoid distruction of our young generations.......
    I m really sorry to say that living with this dirt we neither become Iqbals shaheens nor good muslims.............
    we must accept that we are muslims and one day Allah will ask us about what we did.......

  content: Undoubtedly, It is extremely unlawful to record someone's personal activity
    and later exploit it to black-mail the former. This can not be solved individually,for,
    in this way, the dirt can-not be washed away effectively, however, GOVT. intervention
    is profoundly important to prohibit these acts raised by few devils across the
    country. All such persons happened to caught must be strictly treated so that
    this evil can be abolished from the country. Praying for my country to rise HIGHEST
    on the globe n World is gonna watch it. Regards :-

    Wow...to finally find the real dirt in pakistan, and for this to be so openly exploited I'm suprised. The behaviour of these young adults is shocking and an embaressment and of course punishment is to be sought from the almighty himself.Is it not him who decides the time and place of death, and is it not him and only him who has the righteous power to take a life, be that of a street whore who carries out the acts of sin to survive, or that of a person who has taken anothers life. No one has the right to take a life, except the almighty. Recently having visited pakistan and seen over such a time period how much had changed from my last visit, showed how westernised cultures had over-powered the traditional and cultural pakistan I once came to know. 'you shouldn't forget your roots' the most common words uttered from parents to their children living in the UK or anywhere but Pakistan. How can we possibly look them in the eyes and say how wonderful of place their country is with all this dirt going about. After my visit and seeing the country in such a state, i had to say the only way to survive in pakistan is to LIE, CHEAT & STEAL... Its the truth, the rich are too rich and shame on them for not controlling their 'i think im all that' children for getting out of hand, and the poor, well you only have to take a good look. So its understandable WHY the blackmailers did it. As you can see i have not refered to girls in one way and to boys another as the saying goes IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO!!
    Both can be blamed equally. Parents play a key role into how their children grow up, so yes they should also get a fair share of the blame. I guess this is a lesson which SHOULD to be learnt by everyone. Im also not saying that the girls who took thier lifes did good, because if they didnt, someone else probably would have, and for what?...HONOUR...oh yes im sure were suppose to take that to our death beds.

    Asalam Alaikum everybody,
                              My heart goes out for those family who lost there girls and had to go through with this unimaginable pain that i cannot even think about it. I am sorry that you guys had to face black mailing, physical and metally tourcher in this so called "MUSLIM COUNTRY" pakistan. I read lots of comments about that, its girls and there family fault, and yes i support that.Its family fault that you guys live in this so called "MUSLIM COUNTRY" PAKISTAN, its your fault because your pakistani and i am sorry about that. I was there last year in pakistan I live there for about month and for whole month i didnt even find one "MUSLIN" in this so called "MUSLIM COUNTRY". Pakistani people are the most bios, arrogant and illiterate people in the world and i am embarrass to call my self pakistani where people like blackmailers get away and nobody even talk about how bad and discusting thing that they did to those family, they didnt only mentally but physically hurt those family they should be charge for murder. And family like them had to suffer and plus had to take shit from you people. In pakistan there is nothing but a double standard. Now tell me all of you who think that thats girls fault or there family fault or there family suppose to kill those girls or anything. If you want this islamic laws than we should have every islamic laws not only for those family but for everybody in every aspect. Islamic laws not only for sex but for stealing too and so on. And my friends islamic law for stealing is that your hand cut off from your wrist. Stealing electric city, direct connection which i saw in pretty much ever house there, those people hands suppose to be cut off. Its really easy to say that its the family or girls fault but you guys have no idea, what they have to go through. I can only pray for all of us that we never had to go through what they had been through. But next time if you talk about islamic laws or think thats there family fault look at your self first or look at your "HAND" before judge anybody.
    Allah hafiz.

    salam all.
    I heard about the pakistani internet cafe scandal in Hong Kong , those days i was there and one of my indian friend passed me this Cd and asked me to see WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND THE VIEL , when i saw I really feel so much shame and everyone laughed on pakistani society .
    This is all in that Cd was inspiration of western culture and of indian media , which makes mind like this , but one should think about him/her self and all of their respected families , coz this kind of act can make all the family to hide face from the society.
    Also every person have their own responsibility to stop this kind of culture , this time if we see anyone and ignore then we are not loyal to our Nation ,our Country , our families also .
    We must act togather and now because all things cannot be controll by local police or goverment

    to be living in what I would call cukoo land or have their heads burried in sand.
    Most cant seem to remember their own days when they are young. Further to call
    Pakistan a moral country even, so lies, killings, hidden rapes, forced marriages,
    selling girls, revenge killings, bribery, fake promises, major ego problms ..my
    list is long ...all seem okii to all of you cos these have been their since birth
    of Pakistan. \nOnly shamefull thing you found is some folks having sex.. the rest
    dont matter or I dont see comments on.\n\nAs for religion and sex ..solution is
    not to hold it so to speak solution is marriage..oh no then you have western hat
    on its too early too young not mature... what the hell do you expect these young
    people todo.. and before netcafes are you telling me there were no pre-marital
    affairs. \n\nJust having the name muslim makes you moraly correct.. believ me
    most westerners are far far more moral then you muslims.. they do everything in
    open with reason... since they dont marry early or not at all they allow premarital
    sex.\n\nYou cant delay marriage and not allow natural body needs to exist.\n\nI
    am going to say no shame on people on cd's ..shame on you all for creating a situation
    for the cd's ..and how all of you innocently have the cd's .. believe me its not
    that easy to get them unless u goto certain places and ask.. no friend of mine
    dropped any on my lap.\n\nAll I can say is to wake up to reality and cut this
    honour crap .. it only exist as a double standard.. no one from inside believes
    in it.. before you comment bla bla on me .. just open your eyes and explain to
    me how over half a million prostitutes make a living in Lahore alone.. who pays
    them .. \nAs for laws and filtering .. you cant filter porn.. and Pakistan is
    a lawless country .. I dont see any laws working, making new once wont make a
    damn difference.\n\nAlso before net cafe's .. how many of you were inocently watching
    porn on video!!!"

    Hi all,
    I have been reading people saying alot of mis-guided ideas and stories abt what happened in net cafe. No one, believe me NO ONE sold the cds for money, and NO ONE AT ALL blackmailed anybody, its all rubich altogether. the cd just went out of cafe, cpoies and copies and copies and now its over the world. It was started to control the people and tell them dont do this, but they used to fight that they are right and they were not doing anything, then they might have started this as a proov, and later on owner of the cafe didnt know at all what was happening in the club, as he he rarely used to sit in the cafe, the guys working there, could be there deed. but this selling cd for 10 lack, or black mailing is absolutely rubich, actually this was something new for the people of pak, thats y it got so much advertisement. this story chould be closed now, you cannot say anybody wrong here apart from people who were doing sex there, instead of using cafe for information they were using it for their own sake.

    I agree with you Liaquat Ali, you are very much right, people are talking about all this because they have come to know about this, dont people think before this cd, those people were doing nothing, they were doing everything, but that was hidden from society, now everyone knows it, so there should not be no difference. All pakistan video shops selling and renting sex movies, not from western countires but those made within Pakistan, why dont people speak about this, because everybody loves this and watches this all. People committing suisided is natural, when anybody comes to know about him/herself that s/he been caught, its natural to comitt suiside, bcus they know they were wrong.
    This cafe story is just a child, we have finish parents and elders, those are sex movies in music/video centres, MUJRAS, HEERA MANDI SYSTEM, INTERNET SEXY SITES. if these things are not there, this will not happen for sure.

    I would just like to comment on the issue of killing those girls (ahem...while letting the guys free). Islam laid down in the quran a strict rule that if you are to accuse a woman then u have to produce 4 adult muslims who have impeachable character who actually saw the act of penetration. and even then stoning to death is only for married adulterers.
    So may i know where are the four pious ppl. Is the evidence of a blackmailer,a swindler a men of the worst character admissable in any Islamic court!!! thirdly four ppl are supposed to have seen the real act and not merely the captured images which we all know can be made up.
    fourthly i dont remember the name of the caliph but i believe it was hazrat Ali and during his time a couple was charged by four men that they had committed adultery. Those four people were lashed you know why? because the crime of adultery was done behind closed doors and not in the open and peeping on people (nowadays with a hidden camera) is strictly not allowed.
    The real person to be punished is that guy and all his cronies who carried out this shameful act of videotaping. yes the couples were wrong to do it, but may i know on what basis did every1 assume that they were not married????
    please those couples did wrong but Allah does not like people who ashame others like this. If we are true and real muslims we will stop thinking of the girls as 'bad' bcos I am really sorry to say that we have no iota of islamic evidence to accuse them. If you are real believers accept them as normal girls who MAY have committed some wrong but who has not from among us anyway.
    One of the sahabi once said that whomsoever looks (ok let us change it to stare,scan,mental rape)at a woman who is a non-mahram commits adultery.why dont all of us give our eyes 40 lashes then!
    Islam is not about stoning and lashing or owning women it is about humanity. islam has tried to make sure that crimes like adultery dont become something that is openly committed in public, and there is a fine line between reporting a crime and watching secretly through a camera.this was pure and simple blackmail, none of the evidence is permissable as the provider of that evidence is a criminal a lier, a blackmailer, and in any case there are no FOUR witnesses of pious character who can testify that they saw the act of penetration. stop hounding these women now as required by your very own religion

    salam All...

    Its ben pretty long to this incident but still there is an echo coming across.
    I would like to laude the comments of Mr. Faisal very much right in his assertion.
    We are so deeply struck by the modrenisation phenomenon that sounds real difficult to revolt.The frustration is at its peak and we unconsciously exhaust it through some way or the other..and we feel good same in this case just talking and listening and reading about it.
     Dear All.... i ld like to endorse the views of mr FAISAL and will recoomend to give a deep thinking to our ownself...IF we think in the shoe of those who suffered ...we will never talk abt it agian.
    So its better to stay quiet and seek their forgivenes from Allah Almighty as "TO err is human"....AND NO ONE KNOWS...who is NEXT!

    was their crime so big that they have to loose their life for it. The people who
    made the video are the real criminals, first they invaded the privacy and secondly
    they blackmailed them. I dont know but one thing is for sure our society is going
    down. The people who made the video deserve death because they are responsible

I KNOW IM RIGHT!! the momement somebody statred taping u guys...it became a sin!! i cant believe how hypocritical u guys are.  blaming other ppl. u know..LOOK INTO UR OUN SELF.

    Also, i would liike to say tht,Mr. Liaquat Ali was totally correct. it is ver rare to find a good people like him in the muslim community anymore. i want to ask all those ppl who are blaming the ppl doing sexual acts in the net cafe, havent u lloked at a girl and thought of "doing" it with her, or feeling her up!? havent u ever watched a porn..and havent u ever ran to the bathroom the "feel good"?? YES! ALL OF U HAVE. so all u bloody hypocrats..and no life losers...LOOK INTO UR OWN WORLD,AND THEN BLAME THE OTHERS.

    have intercourse if they are not married to someone else and are using proper
    contraception. afterall , they are not impringing on someone else's right. This
    is the 21st century and we should remember that Europe only started developing,
    after they ditched religon. As for the bloody maulvis who say that it was right
    to kill these girls, they should go to some Madressah and get themselves sodomized.

    Okz i had read what SANA have said about me.........listen.......if u do mistake and u r ashamed of that,it means u r asking for forgivness from GOD.GOD helps this kind of ppl.but the ppl like u are the ppl inside that cafe to record all that scene.i was not blamming anyone,i did a mistake and i got its result. and one more important thing,b4 the news enclosed to me or anyone other about those camera,i already had left those things.
    so its only ur thinking about others.......or hypocrats.......as u may have seen ppl like these.i was not blamming any cristians or muslims...but what is fact is fact.what i did was wrong.......but they did with me that was also wrong......for my mistake they cud call my family...but for there mistake to whome we can call.....i was punished bcoz of sex.......but they also did the same thinking plus blackmailing...so what punishment they deserves.with SANA comments its seems that SANA have no pain for the ppl who died.

  content: "I read short and tall stories and Mr. J Ch.'s rant. I have been around
    the globe and only thing I know is that there is no point in having cabins in
    netcafes. So far, I have not seen any internet cafe with cabins in USA, CANADA
    or Euroope.\n\nThe registration of cafe is not a solution. The solution is in
    enforcement of only one law that would require net cafes not to have cabins. They
    can have a computer lab style desks with seperators and that should be enough
    for privacy purposes. No one would be able to look over someones shoulder to sneak
    on one's email or something.\n\nAs far as freedom of information and browsing
    whatever you want is concerned, go home and do whatever you want in the privacy
    of your home. You are answerable to your sins to Allah as long as you are in 'chardiwary'
    if you do it in public then society's laws apply. Remember the concept of chaddar
    and chardiwary. I am not making a case for doing sins at home but eleborating
    a point that public domains should be open. If you scream for cabins in the name
    of privacy then seek privacy in home not in public. \n\nFor short, there should
    be no cabins in internet cafes. They were meant for only one purpose and that
    has become obvious .....\n\nEven if you want to have cabins then the doors should
    be like the restroom doors in western coutries. One feet cut from bottom and top
    so that you can see heads and legs, I mean who is inside. You will have enough
    privacy to information but at the sametime no opportunity to have sex, which means
    no incentive for netcafe wala (owner) to do voyeurism.\n\nThe voyeurism has been
    very common in rest of the world, thanx to camera cell phones and wireless spy
    cameras. I guess it is not easy to stop but having effective and well defined
    laws will help. NetCafe registration would be ineffective and only promote more
    corruption. If you can register \nand have cabins at the same time you can still
    do voyeruism by buying out the law enforcement agents. The only solution is having
    open spaces in net cafes."

    Assalam-u-Alaykum

    Its really interesting to see so many opinions and it is good to have discussion on such impending topics in our modern Islamic society. My opinion is that we educate the people and encourage people to leave this material crap behind us. Parents need to realize that they should marry off their children at an earlier age and do not constrain their children which would force them to do bad things. I mean in the Prophet's (SAW) time it was really easy for people to marry and it was very easy for people to do halal and very difficult to do haram. Nowadays though people find it easier to do haram then the halal way. This change has cost us this terrible dilemma we see today. If only parents would realize that a bank balance, a degree, and a good job are not necessary requirements for marriage, these barriers cause these haram type of things to happen. We need to encourage early marriages and promote a family life.

    Wassalam

    While browsing I came across to view the comments of you people. Horriable tale, I imagined what would happend to the people who were trapped there and still living alive in our hypocrat society. For the people who create all the fuss and ruined the life of 50 young peaple(25 couples)I am sure must be freely moving around as I am very well aware of our so called laws.
    I would like to comment on Mr Imran views who is also running a net cafe. He says that people maturbate in his cafe and he catch them. Well I think that he belongs the same mentality. Obviously you are providing them privacy and then catch them playing with themselves. Bad thing.
    what the young couples have been doing in privacy was natural thing. we should not relate this act to religion or country. Put a couple from any creed race or religion in a cabin and they would do the same thing. Mr Asif says that he has done toba, but I am sure that same thing would be happened again if he will get any chance. Do not get upset if there would have been me or my young sister result would have been the same.
    In the end I would request all of you people not to feel yourself better than anybody. What Mr Javaid Choudhry has emphasise in the writing is clear and present danger of coming technology. I have already seen the movies captured by cameras of mobile phone where you dont see the male but only female doing something to boy unaware that boy is capturing her. Be careful all of you

    is not happening there. We should not compare ourselfs with other countries that
    this is nothing new. we know what all is happening there is extreemly bad, recently
    in France child sex abuse case came up, that all is filth but we have our own
    morals. Lets pray to God to guide and give us the strength to follow the correct
    path. Individual efforts can make socity collectively better but if we keep discussing  who
    was at fault or  what some one else did was more wrong and do not stop committing
    sins (which we r still committing every day) this will not lead us to any personal
    or collective good. OH GOD GIVE US ALL FORGIVENESS AND GUIDE US TO CORRECT PATH

    I am amongst those who saw the video.It all happened in an internet club in Commercial Market,Rawalpindi.The girls doing the act were not kidnapped or lured away,they went out with their boyfriends with their full consent and knowing well what they could do inside the cabins so they are equally to be blamed.
    Premartial sex in Pakistan is on the rise but not as rampant as it seems after watching that sick video.Most of the girls hangout with guys having been fooled that the guy won't ever ditch her and they pay a price to get his loyalty but it all ends up in pain and rejection.
    Coming back to that video,everyone talks about the  disaster coming down on the families involved but little is known about what happened to those assholes who filmed them.
    Did they flee or are they back in business doing some other sleezy work?They should be shot dead since they spread out the sin to millions of people and made money out of it.
    Anyway to inform you all,the voyeur filming of sex acts hasn't stopped.More sex videos have come out from the red light areas and motels.Even legally married couples are not being spared in this sleazy business and their intimate moments are being filmed in hotels as well.

    The very structure of the so-called internet 'clubs' in Pakistan are an open invitation for the iblees to play around.Why do they build closed cabins with locks inside?Obviously no one is going to do a research on a chemistry project or browse encarta..nobody.
    I have seen some internet clubs with icons and shortcuts on the desktops making sure hardcore porn sites are just a click away.
    Imagine your 12 year old sister or brother or son or daughter going to a netcafe to email but is instead lured to visit a hardcore porn site.A lot of these clubs offer to play hardcore porn movies already saved in the hardisk to make the job easier.This is a very very dangerous trend and must be stopped.If pornography continues to spread like this,no one will be spared.
    I am all for internet clubs.They are a better way to spend time than hanging around at street corners but they must be restructured and a law should be passed whereby there should be no closed cabins and the PCs should face outwards not inwards as in most other countries.
    Once the closed cabins are done away with it,I am sure this sleeezy business will come to an end.Good people will stay in the job while sick minds will go away.

    The real culprits in the whole episode are the owners of the internet club who designed the cabins in such way that they look like hotel rooms complete with locks and invited the iblees by offering hardcore porn movies already saved in the hardisks for all to see.
    The girls have been unduly punished by their families for their acts. Instead they should have been pardoned and allowed to seek forgiveness from Allah but the criminals who were the masterminds of the whole sleazy business have gone spared.
    Not all internet clubs in Pakistan are like that but quite a lot of them offer hardcore porn movies to the users .I have visited a few centers, which have made shortcuts on their desktops. One only has to click it to be led away intoto a world of sin and sleaze,corrupting innocent minds.
    I am all for internet clubs actually. More should be opened and encouraged but a strict law must be passed whereby there must be no closed cabins and all PCs must face outwards not inwards. This will ensure people going to these centers will visit clean sites and not do sick acts when alone.Watching porn sites and then doing sinful acts is all the more dangerous in Pakistan where free mixing is looked down upon and this leads to a sick mind.We are losing a whole generation because of this dangerous trend.

    Its in response to imran.
    It has been said here before as well that the talks about selling the cds outside is totally rubish. No one sold'em. Movies just made to control and then copies got out for no reason. Rest story all know about our paki society, copies and copies and copies - whoever came to know about it wanted it, and likewise it spreaded internationally. I know the story behind this, It is not what it appears. Owner did not even used to come there regularly, he didnt know what was happening until it was in news. this was all spoiled by our spoiled media. i accept it was not good for people who are in movie but believe me it has stopped hundred of thousands from doing anything like this forever. It was a lesson for all and in that sense it is better than anything else.

    that I am not from Pakistan, but I am a muslim and there is no boundary in Islam.
    So it is a very big shame for us, the people of other religions will blame on
    us, that see there are also muslim like that. It is a big shy for all muslims
    around the world. All should be \nvery very very very very very very very very
    very\ncare full.\nThanks for paying your attention, it is appeciatable.\n\nThanks
    once again and bye, take care"

    Salaam to all !
    well i have read so many comments and almost everyone was right as far as defending his own point of view. all what happened 2 years back ! i can say is '' Result of Frustration'' in our society. Frustration means , when we know everything is going around in our society ( like xxx movies , sites, dates by girls and boys in shape of universities lunches and dinners etc ), so we dont let any chance go from our hands. when we know publical declaration of such things are bad in our society. all we need to do is first to look into our selves what we are, what we could have done , if we were at place of those boys and girls. first we have to look into our zameer, then we have right to decide whats right and wrong. Those who did these acts got the reward, but we should make sure, what we say or discuss in the forums , we are like same when we get some real opertunity.
    thanks

  content: "Dear O Dear whatz happening in country like this. I have to say something
    about this topic that should it be publicized or not. The thing done by the respective
    Net Caf&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy; owner is bad that he was taping without
    telling the general public about it. The fact I know about it is that the person
    initially has not planned this sin but after boyz n galz coming together he got
    the idea and he start taping it for his personal use then he and his society went
    to sale the tapped material. Immediately after the news were in air that this
    kind of thing is sold in all around the world the person left the country and
    the people living here in PAKISTAN some enjoyed some confused and some gone for
    suicide (hope u understand who went for suicide). \nNow what you say how Islam
    controls these kinds of things you take that. Now don&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t
    publicize that this happens and people committed suicide change your style and
    publicize it like that people committed suicide due to bad sins they have so beware.
    What is the matter people will internally discuss it and finally the vigilant
    culture will be developed.\n\nNow come to a point one has posed in starting that
    if you are a man would your wife or sister kill you. I think when you look at
    this thing the only death through other person reported is father killed her daughter.
    The person who introduce you to this world has ended the story. You know the respective
    girl could never live if she would have alive but due to she died so she died
    may be she can reach to Paradise through this way.\nThink that if these people
    in this age are doing these lovely things what their future is. If you are trying
    to do something bad and caught napping certainly you are saved. If you have done
    it you have done it. That means a stamp is printed on you heart now there is no
    way to come back. It is pure form of ZANAH and need nothing to say more on this.
    \nCameras in Net Caf&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy; & Change Rooms:\nChange
    Rooms does not need cams so that is straight away a crime in net caf&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy;
    I tell you what in our city there are two net caf&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy;
    &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup2;s who have cabins and from last
    four years they are running these Ncaf&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy; s they
    have clearly printed on reception as well as in cabins that they are monitored
    both inside computer and outside the computer through cams so people go there
    and use net for last so many years we have not seen any bad report coming out
    even galz go there use net freely. Its just your inside which matters other things
    are second.\n\nThanks"

    Well,the internet cafe sex scandal has come and gone like a nightmare falling on our society.Lets say it was a rude awakening and installing the hidden cameras was in a way a blessing in disguise since had there been no cameras and no taped movies,the sinful acts would have continued even now and dozens of girls more would have lost their innocence and this would have gone on and gone.
    Thanks to those criminals who planted the hidden cameras,not only has their business come to an end for good but it has sent a wave of awareness all over the country and thats good.
    Having said that I have previously argued that internet cafes are a good place to spend time and more should be established but by obeying laws like no cabins and no closed doors etc etc.
    As i said this hurricane has already passed by.I doubt if anyone of you still remember what happened in UK in March 1992.A couple of British-Pakistani girls living in Manchester,UK did a few strip shows in UK raising money.What they used to do was invite a select gathering of mostly Pakistanis in a rented house and did strip shows for them which usually ended in mild lesbian acts.
    Movies of their shows did a roaring business in Pakistan so much so that newspapers in Pakistan published front-page reports about the Pakistani girls belonging to well-off families in Punjab.Their parents later disowned them and cursed their daughters but the daughters went on doing their acts for a few more months untill it all subsided and no one knows what happened to them.
    So one hopes the storm has subsided and whenever one goses around that notrious neighbourhodd which played host to the sinful acts it reminds us of the days it happened.

    With the proliferation of cheap,aoffordable mini cameras,no one's privacy is safe.I have heard some criminals have videotaped activities of newlyweds in hotel rooms and distributed them.New cameras come with night vision so you can still see them in the dark.This is getting more and more sickening and now even legally married couples are not safe.
    This would take us back to the practice of spending the wedding night in the safe and comfortable confines of our own home where you have to fear none. After all this is our culture and spending the nights in hotels is a western practice.

    their home members or behind their husbands but this not is good here i can advise
    to all that if any one can like to do like these type of works then its better
    for them that they can tell to all their family members because if any one can
    know about your this type of work after your your this type ofv doing then really

    hi buddies , first of all i come to my point.
    i.e there is no place in the world where sin is not spread except few places.the matter is that
    peoples lost thier faiths to thier Gods.they want to enjoy thier life that is why that incident occurs.and only solution is to worship thier Gods with heart and soul.

    Hi fellows,

       Each & every body in this universe is being watched or observed by the God. There is no such place which is hidden from God,however if some one is going to commit sin then he should find a place where God is not present!

    (One can never find such place.)

    hey! I've read most replys, what baggers me is everyone seems to be talking religious and pride to families...bla bla bla.

    ok your right it was wrong watching prono and acting prono,BUT whose fault is it? FOR GOD SAKE,before blaming youngesters blame your elders,who are suppose to give you guide lines of your growing year.What live is,what it brings and most important SEX!!!!! Thats where we go wrong.Our parents think we are born with guidelines,and when something foolish happens,they blame you.

    please dont blame those who were the victims.Think how white blooded and cold hearted those cafe oweners are.They should be jailed atleast if no law is passed against them. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!

    you make me disgusted with sickness on you!!!!

    The stuff described in these events is appalling and at the same time disheartening to me.  Whenever we are faced with a story of extortion and morality I feel that there are a vast number of people who immediately appeal for government controls, while others appeal for condemnation of the people who were caught.  This is in effect irresponsible and indicative of our lost faith in our own abilities to effect change.  Bad things happen not because there isn't a law against it, but because, many times, people believe that what they are doing is righteous and morally justified.  Just take the case of the people who beat their sister/daughter in public.  Is this because of the actions that she did? or is it mostly because the ones doing the beating felt they had the authority and right to punish?  I fail to understand how we can believe in God and all his power and at the same time not hesitate at all to take judgement into our own hands and decide what is right and wrong, several times without complete information.  Now I am not sure what happened to the people that did the extortion or those that compiled and sold the tapes, but these people are the true culprits.  To want to profit from others by holding them hostage is completely immoral.  You are ineffect a traitor to your fellow man.  Is there a difference between a man who steals or extorts and a man who looks at "naughty" websites? I don't want to preach here but at the same time I feel that we all miss the point at times when we listen and speak about this kind of stuff.

    The obvious victims are those who's families are exploited and those poor people who took their own lives or were punished through force, but they aren't the only victims of society.  The people that feel it is correct to exploit and blackmail are also victims.  Our own society has trapped many people in situations where their only outlets to self expression are through areas considered to be immoral or criminal.  The way in which education is only valued if it is certain fields is completely ignorant.  Without education we are killing the ambition and dreams of people.  We are creating a situation that only compounds the problems.  The problem isn't that there is not enough regulation of cafes it is that people don't know better.  All 90% of the people do is look with disapproval, no one steps forward and offers alternatives or advocates for a fresh start.  I feel that our society is becoming more and more grounded in hypocrisy.  There are people that say it is wrong to do drink or have affairs but then engage in these activities behind closed doors.

    Are we saying that it is wrong to sin, but only if you get outed in the media?  This mentality is incompatible with societal maturation and the personal development of our people.

    talk about them...all of us have seen this moie and nobody took permission from
    there parents to watch it and to watch it is itself a crime...so we all do crimes.....however
    the person who was behind the taping should be punished..he had no right o do
    this...its ot only the couples who faced the pain but what baout there families
    and parents....So i feel bad for the couples too..they did wrong but they never
    deserved whatever happened....thats what i think...i don't know what happene dto
    that person involved with the taping.but i hope some guy killed him.....

    to do it etc, because of the lack of such education by them these phenomenon occur.
    Infact i am also feel very much hesitant abt discussing such, its IN our society.\n\n\n\nIts
    a common phenomena that a man seeks attraction in a thing which attracts and especially
    when we he doesn't have info abt it.\n\n\n\nOur conscience is also very much weak
    abt this matter as we are actually provoked by our environment abt committing
    such things. especially by our rich freinds(having a taste of luxury), media and
    sometimes even by our brothers. My brother has a taste for having flirts and doing
    blaspherour acts. \n\n\n\nIts natural in our late teen and twenteen years tht
    we are attarcted to the oppsite gender, But its ur conscience(nafs,zameer) which
    makes u keep away. \n\n\n\nAs for the culprits both sides are equally guilty.
    And the commitment of suicide and murders aren't the solutions but proper consultation
    and forgiveness.\n\n\n\nin the end i just say keep urself away from such ideas
    and try to know abt it by consultation with ur parents as it will help u alot,
    don't consult freinds or others as they can give u the wrong perspective. I have
    experienced it all my life, my freinds common topic is this, they talk abt it
    all the time, getting a gf is an art they try to learn it... My conscience made
    me keep away, urs too can!"

    Hi everyone,the reasons for all these obsanities in our society is due to our week understandig and relation with our religion.God created two kinds of hungers for the mankind one is the real

    hunger for food and the second is the hunger for sex.

    Allah has also given the solution for the sex hunger to get the kids married when they get juvenile means (Baligh).But as we are following the western culture to wait for them to complete their education and then start thinking for their

    marriage.

    This is totally wrong.They can live together during their education period after getting married.

    So please think about this.

    If you wanna furhter talk to me send me a reply at my   email address

       SUCH COUPLES HAVE ALL THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND GET PUNNUSHED ACCORDING TO THAT.  BUT WHO THE HELL ARE THESE CRIMINALS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TO PUNNISH SUCH PEOPLE WHO COMMIT SUCH ACTS.  LET THE SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS OF SUCH PEOPLE BE FILMED LIKE THAT TO TEACH THEM A LESSON.
      I HAVE SEEN SUCH A VIDEO CD WHICH WAS SHOT IN A NET CAFE, MOST OF THE COUPLES WERE INNOCENT YOUNGSTERS TRYING TO EXPERIMENT WITH WHAT THIS SOCEITY HAS TAUGHT THEM. THEY INDULGED IN FULL SEXUAL ACTS. BUT WHO PROVIDED THEM WITH SUCH A PLACE? WHO BROUGHT THEM UP WITH SUCH TEACHINGS?

    Ok I have read most of these comments; some suggested to put provisions on Cyber Cafes others suggested lock-up your daughters but what's shameful is no one suggested to liberate the society.  Free and open minds do not do such things.  Educate the young generation, make them aware.... knowledge is the most powerful tool.  How can you tell an 18 year old that sex is bad...its not.  If you try to stop people from going against nature it's not going to work.  God made human being and expects them to have Sex so basically what we need is to teach our kids how to make decisions based on education and information and not out of fear.  Educate your kids, make them aware and give them freedom and lastly trust them and they will never let you down.



    Furthermore, the owner of the Internet caf&Atilde;&copy; where these acts took place should be prosecuted to the fullest extend of the law.  He should have disclosed that there are closed circuit cameras in the booths and that people are being recorded.  The adults in the booths are consenting adults so they did nothing wrong&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;bad choice of place maybe.  The families who have lost their kids to this despicable act should make sure that their kid's lives are not wasted.  Stand up for them and fight for a better society.

    First of all i wud like to appreciate a man, a Pakistani man( I assume yr paki) for getting into something like this and presenting an unbiased content for us to read.



    And "NO" i repeat, no i wudnt kill my sis or any other woman in my family for going the wrong way. wat they did was wrong, no doubt... but wat was dun to them was even more wrong, just to satisfy the financial greed of some scum bags many ppl were expoited... wat they did was adutery killing them wud make us even more sinfull than them, even Islamic Shari'ah law does not allow u to slay someone for comitting adultery.



    i havent had time to go thru all the posts.. but i came across one stating something along the lines which seemed to state that we need to shun the "betraying" women this either came from a male chavinist or a woman who was raised by one, who taught her never to speak for wat she thot was right, never to use something called brains which Allah has bestowed upon her, cuz god forbid if she does, she shall be killed for being a BAD woman.... BETRAYING maybe...

    news flash to the author of that comment

    there were men involved too..taali do haathoon sey bajti hai... and it defnitey takes 2 to tango!! ne ideas wat to do with the betraying men ???



    Further more this other dude goes on to ask women not to fall in luv... muffin i pity ur offsprings who r going to be females... used and fucked by men .. and he says he knows how men think, cuz he is one of them... well sweety wat goes up comes down... and thats a definite, its abt time we changed the fuck n chuck mentality our men have and teach THEM how to respect women... wats next.. gonna ask us to quit breathing. OWWW my bad ... i think thats already dun.. on an average of 10 ....7 women wont even talk to u if their hubbies din allow them to ...





    and ofcouse to the bane of our pakistani existance... the black mailling industry... i hope they a get a tatse of their own medicine, 10 times stronger n harsher i must add.



    finally i must add .. TO ERR IS HUMAN..  we need to  STOP being all high n mighty cuz none of us is... in case we were we wont be here posting out comments on this forum on panet earth, we wud be angel in heaven.:)



    and once again the author did a gud job, we do need an awakening and its abt time we got one!!

    i 100% agree with you  Iqbal Sahib.



    those children made mistake. but they were not supposed to be punished like this after all they are human beings and future builders of our nation.



    the punishment was supposed to be given to those who have black mailed them.



    why nobody is black mailing those land lord or those power ful poloticians, who are sleeping with a new lady every night. because they are powerful and could easily hide their sins.



    dear all i thing we should learn from this and i think its better to finish this 2 .5 years old topic .

    have forgotten it a long time ago but people like us always keep it alive ...
    things do go wrong people do make mistakes and who are we to punish them why don't
    we leave it to Allah who are we to suggest what should be done to those ignorants...
    even i myself have watched those videos of net cafe and that i watched em with
    interest so infact i think we all are develish n double standards.... yes that's
    what we really are infact ignorants... big time ...but we need to mend our ways
    the way we live on one hand we enjoy what we have seen on the other we comend
    it criticize it and try to tell others that we are saints.... my brother and sisters
    infact we have gone so far that we have forgotten every thing that we have been
    told in our book... sad isn't even most of you seem to be sensible and literate
    but couldn't we atleast try at our individual level to change our society couldn't
    we take care of our sisters daughters brothers ... instead of wasting our energies
    in criticizing for Gods sake we need to wake up now coz i believe its not too
    late as we think we still have got some time left... and yes we are a bit influenced
    by western society but all we are gonna end up is nothing a big nothing some of
    you might b thinking i m trying to b a big mouth or something if that's what you
    think so be it .... we need to b consistent in what we think what we do and what
    we pretend to be.... so brothers and sisters we believe in family system... we
    respect our sisters,  mothers we have strong moral values.....why not learn from
    this experience it could b a bit difficult but that's not impossible... all we
    need to do is to  THINK POSITIVE and believe in what we have.... God bless you

    on my self that i live in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nFor these all views which everybody
    is giving do they know that every person in the world can access these information,
    so what they will expect from Muslims specially from Pakistanies.\r\n\r\nSo, we
    are reqpersenting ourselves. yes its true there is only sex in our mind and nobody
    miss chance whenever they got it. Same time people running net cafe in a sence
    to provide a safer place to do sex with anyone mate, moreover; they are catching
    them also instead of showing them right direction they are going to get a reason
    of encash them.\r\n\r\nIn short a man can make mistake, he may be wrong, Is there
    any one to show him right path. (SORRY NO ONE).\r\n\r\nI think we have Information
    Technology in our country but sorry to say we dont know the meaning of I.T.\r\n\r\nIt
    should be banned if we dont know want to use it. or Govt should take some serious
    steps to educate people through media also otherwise our young generation will

  content: "I am extremely saddened by the events that have unfolded in Pakistan after
    this 'net cafe scandal', and really disappointed
    by some of the posts above. \r\n\r\n I personally believe that there is no reason
    to bring religion into this. \r\nIt is said that knowledge is power, and the internet
    is a virtually unlimited source of information and knowledge. The internet is
    the future, and plays an important role in the development of our public; it will
    be extremely stupid on the government's part to deprive the
    citizens of Pakistan of the internet in any form. \r\n\r\nThe internet cafes are
    designed around the world for those people who either can not afford to have internet
    access at home, or are restricted from accessing it at the time. I believe that
    internet cafes should be encouraged in Pakistan. I agree with the author with
    his view of having stricter laws regarding privacy, but in addition to that, the
    internet cafe business should be regulated. If someone is setting up an internet
    cafe with 'private cabins' in it, one can
    immediately deduce the intention behind it. If there was a law prohibiting the
    set up of these 'private cabins', and instead
    have the common layout (that is shared by internet cafes around the world), things
    like this will be prevented in the future InshAllah, and the internet will be
    used for what it was made for, information and knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the
    religion based comments passed above, I personally believe that every person has
    the ability, and thus the right to choose between what is right and what is wrong.
    You can not force a person to do something and hide behind the cover of religion.
    \ If a person wants to commit a sin, it is his choice and his beliefs, and he
    will be accountable for it. Who are you or anyone else to interfere and enforce
    what YOU think is right?  The Almighty has given us all the ability to choose
    between right and wrong, and only He reserves the right to judge us, no one else.
    \ Do not force religion on others; only be concerned about your own deeds and
    affairs.  \r\n\r\nWith regards to the fourth post from the top (Mr. Fateh), I'm
    sorry if this comes out a bit offensive, but that was an extremely childish and
    ignorant statement you made. If your wife or sister was in that cafe, then it
    was THEIR choice (that is what you call freedom). Dont blame the internet cafes,
    the pornographic websites, or the sex drive. Who are YOU to stop the entire population
    of the country from doing whatever they want to? I believe that if a person is
    brought up properly and taught the correct religious values, then he/she will
    abstain from such things on his/her own, regardless of such establishments being
    there in the open, or not existing at all. And lastly, who are YOU to judge who
    lives and who dies?..\r\n\r\nThis is the problem with our public. Everyone thinks
    he/she has been given birth rights to enforce their beliefs and their point of
    views on others. Leave law in the hands of the law-makers, and leave enforcing
    it in the hands of the law-enforcers. Stay out of other peoples business and refrain
    from giving out judgements to others. None of us are any better or any worse.
    \ As the famous idiom goes, &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nTalha,
    \r\nPakistan"

    that this is not the right thing to say in these days of \"enlightened moderation\",

  content: "Sigh... why does religion have to be brought into the discussion of this
    episode?\r\n\r\n\"The owners of the establishment recorded these activities and
    would later show the movies to the couples and blackmail them for dirty deeds.
    This carried on until around 25 couples were ensared. A CD was compiled and send
    to Dubai where it sold for 10 lakh (about $100,000). \"\r\n\r\nWhat I want to
    know is what happened to these owners that recorded this stuff and then sold it.
    I'm suprised by some of the comments which take issue with how people are being
    \"amoral\" or blasphemous and should be put on/follow the \"right\" path. I'd
    take more issue with the owners.\r\n\r\n\"The government should also pass laws
    against cameras in changing rooms. Places where cameras are installed should notify
    the customers via a public sign board\"\r\n\r\nOut of all of the proposals that
    the writer makes in the piece you quoted, this one seems the most feasible and
    sensical. \r\n\r\n\"young men and women started to patronize the establishment.
    They came alone or as couples, went into the cabins and viewed &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;
    websites on the computers. \"\r\n\r\n\"Three of the girls in the scandal committed
    suicide. One was killed by her father. Two were divorced . While the boys ran
    away from their houses. Some of the young men on the CD belonged to very prominent
    families of Rawalpindi. These houses fell prey to blankmailing from the gang.\"\r\n\r\nIn
    regards to this specific event, I wonder: could it be that the very repressive
    nature of social, political, religious and legal norms which dictate social life
    and interactions produce and/or provide an occassion for people to secretly engage
    in so called \"forbidden\" pursuits? And then take drastic measures such as running
    away or worse, committing suicide? I'm asking this because I've seen how overriding
    social norms in India have influenced to varying extents incidents such as this.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\"as the discourse seems to be in a downward spiral of righteous religiosity
    and morally-sanctioned retribution. To be frank, I am quite disturbed by some
    of these comments and almost deleted them. However, I will let them stand to testify
    to the shamelessly premodern conceptions of an individual human still prevalent\"\r\n\r\nBoy,
    tell me about it. I've been tempted more than once to delete comments of this
    kind. But I say, keep them up, if only to illustrate that views of this kind exist
    out there."

  content: Sepoy,  I know you were--at one point--borderline ready to delete some
    of these comments.  I don't suppose I could write something that might push you
    over that edge?  It's just tragic to read and see these, as well as the rubbish
    approach of "don't talk about it, it's shameful, the West is to blame, keep men
    and women separated"...2 years' worth of comments, if acted upon, would apparently
    relegate us to somewhere in the days of Beowulf.

  content: WOW, i just found out about all this in 2007 here in US.  I am sure ppl
    knew about this before but hey i dont go to the porn sites that often.  i know
    the fix to this problem.  Catch the real SOB's who videotaped these ppl.  I wen't
    to pakistan and my friend owns a shop.  When he saw a couple he just told them
    to go to another shop, i didn't know at that time why he said that.  When i asked
    why he said, yaar harkatain kartay hain yeh log. well what he did is what other's
    shud do.  Stop the thing from happening to begin with instead of taping and blackmailing
    them.  Listen, if ppl want to have sex, they will do it regardless of what checks
    u put in place.  All of the people up in the blog who blamed the girls are typical
    example of extremists. Its ok for them to go watch porn but are scared shit about
    what might happen behind their back in their own home and thus are paranoid as
    hell about these videos.  so who do they blame the girls.  Yes i have seen guys
    charm their way in a girls pant.  yaar, paki girls are used to living at home.  most
    of them dont know whats happening outside or how guys are,  the ones who do know
    how guys are also know how to hide it.  i am not defending any one, but yes I
    DO blame the one's who made the video, if it were up to me i would shoot them
    myself.  but one thing what i know is, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.  Allah will
    show them.  those guys and girls got their punishment here in this world, now
    its time for those perverts (cafe owners).  It will happen, watch.  watch as their
    own izzat will be out for sale.  God takes care of things his own way.

  content: oh by the way i forgot to put one last thing down,,,  Treat your woman
    like a human being.  If u are talking about islam then also know that islam has
    given rights to women.  You extremists leave them in ur home thinking they are
    your property.  you Sob's are a shame to our religion.  you wanna see real muslims?
    look at the newly converts,  they know more about islam then you monkey's.  I
    salute Dr Zakir Naik and ppl like him who actually know what the hell they are
    talking about.  Rest of the Maulvi's have their hidden agenda.  Here is the funny
    part,  I talked to another friend from pakistan and he was like, oh acha hoa,
    on larkiyon kay saath yehi hona chahiyay tha.  I was like Whaaa, i mean some men
    back home are soooo biased that he didnt even say" larkay larkiyon kay saath"
    he said Larkiyon kay saath.  dude.  I slapped him on his head to open up his mind.  is
    our society really that bad? Trust me this is not islam,, NOT at all.  This has
    to do more with Culture.  Treating women like herd or property.  I am married.  Trust
    me there is nothing better then respecting each other every day instead of owning
    the other person.

  content: "Salam, \r\n\r\nDear brothers and sister, \r\nToday internet has become
    a big communication media. every thing is done through internet today. Internet
    was designed to advertise, and usa used it for military purpose and today it is
    a commercial item which is needed by everyone.\r\n\r\nMuslim girls were always
    shy to talk with another man nad they never do. and muslim boys never talk with
    girls. this is the true islamic culture. Because of this internet today muslim
    youngsters are chatting with eachother. is there a different between talking face
    to face and chatting on net ? when it comes to webcam, mic and services like YAHOO.
    i dont think so. and boys and girls are today being dragged in to sex. \r\n\r\nAt
    a young age it feels kind of thrilling. but truly is will only give nothing but
    danger and lost of our culture and islamic life style. so every person should
    protect them selves until they are married.\r\n\r\nToday parents dont have time
    to look after there children dont know what they are doing on computer and internet.
    \r\n\r\nso please be careful. Does internet and this all media technology is so
    much important ?,\r\n\r\njust make sure no muslim girl is using internet, then
    muslim boys will stop using too. and things will change step by step.\r\n\r\nthis
    chatting and online love and all will stop,\r\n\r\nSalam"

    unexpected. They grew up in the same society as the rest of us. They should have
    known better.\r\nThe real question, why are the mofo yellow belly whelp boyfriends
    getting away so easy? Are the girl's families going to let them off?\r\nAnd even
    more importantly, are these 'respectable' families going to to do anything about
    the eff-ing SOBs who made and marketed the cds? Respectability doesnt come with
    an address or bank balance... it has more to do with how dangerous it is to offend
    or harm those dear to you... Or maybe you can leave    the tedious task of doing
    justice to the Government. Indeed our boozer dupatta chasing leader inspires much
    confidence.\r\nOf course none of what I say has anything to do with our religion.
    We have frankly lost the right to invoke religion in mundane matters a long time
    ago. Our religion preaches the   dignity of man, the dominion of God, social justice,
    equality and brotherhood, the value of knowledge and wisdom and abhorrence of
    ignorance, arrogance and rashness. Do we follow any of this? (Don't answer.. it

    I know some of you'll say \"speak for yourself\" but come on... who are we fooling?
    Just look at what you do and you will see.\r\n\r\nWhat those couples did is not
    allowed in Islam. But Islam also doesn't allow you to watch TV or listen to music.
    There you go. STUMPED.\r\n\r\nNobody is perfect, apart from God i suppose. We
    must not judge others unless we are perfect ourselves. There is so much i can
    say here, but i won't. It will only be a waste of time.\r\n\r\nThose couples should
    have been more careful. If you are committing a sin, you should atleast hide it
    from the world, even if you can't hide it from God.\r\n\r\nWell... I have so much
    to say... But i wont.\r\n\r\nRegards."

    when I come across some clips of internet cafe scandal. First response was 'shocked'
    and then followed 'the tears' and 'shame'. Never in my wildest imagination I expected
    anything like that happening in Pakistan. May be I have  lived abroad for too
    long isliye didn't realize Pakistan has advanced so much.  I feel so sorry for
    all the girls who were used by those men. WHat I gathered from the clips is that
    those girls didn't know what a shameful act they were doing. They were just an
    object of pleasure for those guys, who were using them for their aiyashi. \r\nAbuse
    of female is very common in Pakistan. Everyday, you'll see the news about rap,domestic
    abuse, honour killing etc. How come females are victimized brutally in a so called
    muslim country and men manage to get away with anything. Go to www.youtube.com
    and search for child labour, protitution, women abuse and you will find uncountable
    no of vidoes of documentaries based on true stories (narrated by the victims themselves).
    I think the most popular programme is 'Taboo' of Geo TV. Its extremely shocking
    and heartbreaking. Makes me wonder if there is any law in Pakistan. No wonder

  content: "Seen one of those net cafe videos, where to me the girl seems very reluctant
    to be engaged in such infamous activity. Anyway at the end she does get engaged
    and VERY WELL engaged. Sorry for the description. Here some questions arise:\r\n\r\n1)
    What does she want to prove by acting reluctant? Is it that she is innocent and
    she could use her then-reluctancy afterwards as her mental comfort that the whole
    thing that happened was not in her hands?\r\n\r\n2) Did these Cyber Cafe owners
    do an evil thing by making these videos?\r\n\r\nSexual urges are sort of injected
    in every human being and animal by our Almighty while He was creating us. But
    the ability to control them is what separates us from other animals. Getting involved
    in sexual activities before marriage is a great Sin and is called Zina, of what
    we all know. I do bother to speak up here just for ONE reason. \r\n\r\n- This
    thing is distracting and completely ruining our young generation, who are now
    spending most of their time going after gals -\r\n\r\nA study says guys haven't
    changed at all since the last thousands of years, regarding these sexual matters,
    as they have always had more desire for sex. But at then times they were sex starved
    or would get married as soon as they hit puberty. As a result no such activities
    were done. But now they are apparently having better times since the Female generation
    have changed a lot. Their mentality, their stature, personality characters have
    changed. Maybe an influence of the media or what ever. Girls now give them more
    chances. They just provoke a guy's sexual desire and compel the guy to 'compel'
    themselves into all these. Well there is not much to say. Both of them do have
    fault. But the thing is why not a single guy commited suicide on the release of
    those tapes but several girls did? - If she realises it's a Sin why did she commit
    it at the first place? I think, it proves that they will do any evil deeds as
    long as other people are not aware of it. For a conclusion it can be said that
    They are doing nothing but destroying our youth. Distracting our youth. Drawing
    them away from there should-be point of focus. Our nation will be destroyed. Although
    the cyber cafe owners had evil intentions but at this point I would like to say
    that their evil deed could be used as a strong weapon against the young generation
    and their notorious activities. We need punishment. Not comments. Seeing all these
    today i wish we had all those yestercenturies punishment established in our nation-
    100 slashes , or stoned to death. Because These are what CAN REALLY HELP US NOW!!"

    suicide,they did bcoz they were unable to face others. Well leavin it. The actual
    solution is what islam told us. Just implement all the SO CRUEL PUNISHMENTS of
    islam n it all will b over. I bet u. But again another problem n that is inequality.
    Why to punish lower class people and no punishment for people who have power,
    status and many other same things. Humans are equal. This will happen. Already
    there lives are miserable n these punishments will make no difference.

    has to get up, gather people around him, n punish the sinners no matter who is
    he or what his or her family is. There will be no gang rapes, no child abuse,
    no murders, no red lights. We can not leave things around us like this we have
    to think n we have to do something now.

    d fact that the persons doing such activities should be kill scarcely along wd
    their fellows.all such activities are due to our implicit behaviour toward religion.goverment
    is responsible mainly for such problems.if HERE r rules laws and regulations according

    Honestly, I think there is a lack of \r\neducation in  our society and system.
    First of all, every parents must inform their children about being recorded \r\nin
    Netcafe. This will give awareness in children and adults what might be the consequences
    if cough on camera. \r\nAlso, it will at least force in youngster to think twice
    before doing an y  inappropriate behavior. \r\nSexual desire is a natural act
    started at very early age,  most of our TV, Dramas,movies and internet made it
    easier    \r\nand must thing which appeals every teens and youngester to do something
    out of families value. Regardless, how much \r\nyou    protect your kids from
    being spoiled you would not be success unless you straighten yourself first. Look
    at \r\naround you  what are you giving to your children and what output you expect
    you will see crystal clear. \r\n'GOD DOES NOT PUT HARM TO YOU, BUT YOU DO YOURSELF'\r\nPakistani
    people tend to be the most aggresive in all, that might be in favor or harm if
    it is being used wrongly.\r\nPlease take your time and talk to your families on
    regular basis with enough time so they understand.  \r\n\"Time to spend for others
    not for desire\""

  content: "Ok boy and Girl i have not read all of you people,s comments about this
    incidents . but still i will say there are lots of people out there who are talking
    about this but not thinking about the reasons which has caused this . \r\nnow
    you got to think for a minute what was the reason caused this and how is this
    wrong how it could have been prevented and what are the mistakes people made in
    the socity and culture which lead these young men and women to this act\r\nNow
    lots of people believe and say oh My God this against Islam Allah said punish
    these people who do this kind of things \r\nBut let me tell you why did this Happen\r\nAllah
    says that punish these people who do this kind of thing but before all that \r\nAllah
    said\r\nyou should get your kids merried at the age of 17 and 18 \r\nWhat is the
    reason of that brothers and sisters there is big reason of this because of what
    Allah mian told  us  to do this the reason\r\nAt the age of 17 and 18 a child
    has the desire to have Sex \r\nboy wants a girl\r\nand girl wants a boy\r\nbut
    we people have become so matiralistic\r\nthat we care about Dunyavii   things
    and forgot about the great teachings of islam\r\nnow what do we want\r\nwhen we
    are arrainging our sons wedding we want girl,s father to give 2500000 rupees  Jahiaz\r\nnow
    that takes time some people can not afoard it and that takes more time and then
    what happens that girl get older and now she is 22\r\nand she has a huge desire
    of having sex because that is a requiremant of life if you do not do it you are
    breaking a rule of islam \r\njust like haveing sex with a man who is not the girls
    husband is bad not havning sex when you are supose to is bad also \r\nnow she
    has a desire \r\nnow her nafas is trying to make her think bad \r\nsame thing
    with the boy\r\nfor the boys it is even harder to control them selve\r\npeople
    want boys to make money so they can feed their wives\r\nbut like i said it takes
    time \r\nand now during that process of making money for his future wife and kids
    he get older\r\nnow his nafs is trying to make him think bad also\r\nand this
    is the time \r\nwhen lots of bad things are created \r\nlots of bad thoughts are
    born \r\nthis is the reason lots and lots of boys and girl masterbate \r\nthis
    is the reason lots of people watch blue (XXX) films\r\nFor some people this is
    enough to amuse them for some this is not\r\nnow when a boy and girl do not get
    merried until they are 25 yrs old and now they so much desparate to have sex and
    they like each other but can not get merried because of stupid man made rules
    \r\nthat is the time when Devil takes the control of their brains \r\nand make
    then so some thing wrong like this \r\nnow we all know this \r\nthat \r\nin islam
    it is not right to do any thing like this\r\nbut as i said\r\nIn Islam it is not
    right to stay un merried \r\nafter the age of 17 to 20\r\nand the reason Allah
    told us to this\r\nis the one what i just told you \r\nAllah made this rule to
    keep us away from the bad things like \r\nXXX movies\r\nand prostitution\r\nZinaa\r\nwhen
    you break one rule there is very very very great chance that the rules which are
    related and depending of the rule which u have broken will be broken also\r\nwe
    know this is wrong\r\npeople who did it knew that was wrong\r\nbut still it happened\r\ni
    am sure lots of people said oh God this is against islam\r\nthis is that they
    should be killed\r\nbrothers and sisters\r\nso can not solve this problem by killing
    any one\r\nto solve a problem \r\nyou got to go to the roots of problem and find
    out what is causing that problem and cut the root\r\nbecause if you will not cut
    the roots the tree of sins will grown again it will take some time but yeah it
    will  grow agian and thats what we do not want to do\r\nso what i want you people
    to do is \r\ncalm down dont be angry \r\nand try to find the solution try to think
    that how can we avoid this to happen in future"

    it is a good thing but if they are using as it was, then it is of course evil.
    \ \r\nI did not see the morale of the Jang story. That what happened to the owner

  content: "Listen up and listen up good because I read all of your damn comments
    on this page(plus the article)...and needless to say over 90% are biased, wrong,
    blind (religion, culture, not being educated,ect), and a great example of how
    ignorant both America AND everyone else (the world) can be. All told it isn't
    about race the majority of America is stupid and the majority of every other country
    is stupid. No exceptions, no racism, just fact.\r\n\r\nNow lets get down to business.
    \ Simply put it isn't the persons who video taped its fault. It is all of your
    own damned fault. For creating a taboo that is irrational and contradictory to
    the NATURAL human experience, of course I am speaking of the natural curiosity
    of sexuality. If you as a people did not become so damn conservative and think
    this is \"sin\" or wrong or not supposed to happen due to your culture let me
    tell you now you will NEVER accomplish this task and you WILL be defeated in due
    time. If you as a people accepted sexuality as a necessary part of humanity you
    wouldn't be so outraged and ashamed, there would be no scandal, and life would
    continue on. \r\n\r\n So all this talk of getting rid of cameras and setting up
    internet site blockers won't get rid of the problem. LOL you know WHAT? It won't
    even slow it down, not even a bit. You know what it WILL do? Haha you'll love
    it. It WILL only encourage people to look for those \"dirty sites\". Like an adult
    who never got to eat his favorite candy as a child because his mom said no...now
    he eats it everyday. \r\n\r\n Oh and Ahamed? You say it is your culture for boys
    and girls not to chat and stay shy? Yet the internet lets them chat.  So the internet
    is bad now? No sir indeed you were the problem all along. The internet just gave
    them the opportunity to talk...one you denied them for so long. Culture and religion
    should not interfere with human rights and if they do they are void. Guess what?
    Yours is void for violating freedom of speech, pursuit of happiness, ...so many
    others..\r\n\r\nIqbal you say we shouldn't comment anymore? Keeping the thread
    alive is also seen as bad custom on internet forums. Why? No reason really other
    than to move on to the next thing. But the situation doesn't move on...the problem
    does not move on. Should you forget this happened it will only happen again. You
    are held responsible now to remember and do whatever is in your power to stop
    it from happening again.\r\n\r\nThree of the girls in the scandal committed suicide.
    One was killed by her father. Two were divorced. The suicidal ones are your fault.
    The flawed rules and ideals you make them accept at birth skewed their sense of
    what is right or wrong from their very birth.  The father was a conservative idiot
    who can only think of honor and whats right for \"the greater good\", the ones
    that got divorced prove their relationships weren't real to begin with since their
    marriage couldn't last the most minuscule and laughable of obstacles. Yes laughable,
    they make videos of people catching their friends (male or female) watching \"dirty
    sites\" in America, Britain, and all the sane countries. They call it a joke.
    You call it sin. Sin you must pay for with your life, respect, honor,...ect. Ridiculous
    really.\r\n\r\nGrow up and become civilized. Then you won't have these problems.
    You'll have OUR problems. Then maybe just maybe...you can advance on to the best
    plate. My problems, as an intellectual who views and comments on all this nonsense
    yet can have no hand in stopping it. Perhaps I should make my own nation. \r\n\r\nNo
    crazy people allowed."

  content: "Sex is a very natural and very real  need. It is simply unnatural to suppress
    it.   It does not matter in which country one is in or to which religion one belongs
    to. We are fighting against nature when suppress sex or wipe it off our minds.
    \ The country which has laws against obscenity (which is a very broad term). Laws
    which strictly prohibit publication of porn,  there are public decency laws, so
    no one can be seen kissing in public.  laws against homosexuality - rather a public
    display of it, it will exist in the privacy of homes. A homosexual will remain
    homosexual. Because of these laws information about the use of condoms is never
    clear, to prevent pregnancy and to prevent sexually transmitted diseases the most
    incurable one AIDS. Many young people have died because of this ignorance.  Birth
    control pills should be available to all females with no questions asked.   There
    are a several young lucky people who have understanding parents. Who do not associate
    sexual needs as something shameful and dishonourable.  These young people have
    healthy sex life because they are informed and educated about it. They can choose
    to marry or not to marry not being forced into marriage.  \r\nOnce all these laws
    are abolished, first of all the sense of frustration and disappointment will end.
    Many people will be freed from guilt associated with it. The porn industry thrives
    on guilty pleasure. But if people are free to decide what kind of person they
    would like to be, will change the attitude of society. All the people who have
    posted here sound afraid. Because society has repressed them so much that they
    can only express themselves in only one way.  Although what they feel and really
    like are completely contradict their views.  It is as if they have been castrated
    since birth and have no sexual desires at all for women or men.  Pakistanis are
    just as sexually active as people in any part of the world, if that was not the
    case our population would not be 170 million today.  Sex and birth are linked
    sadly to say. Your father screwed your mother to give birth to you and you  will
    have sex with some woman she possibly may be bearing your child or some other
    man's and  you will none the wiser. Your sister will get married and she will
    have sex with some man (if she is more adventurous, some men). Perhaps you are
    gay but are too afraid to admit it and you would have childless marriage because
    you only to have sex with men not women. These are the facts. No one can say they
    never masturbated and did not have  some weird fantasy in their mind. Both men
    and women masturbate and it is natural. In public we deny it but privately admit
    it is true. What if your father dies and your mother decides to remarry, would
    think less of her if she does so.  Before anything she is person and sex is an
    integral part of her."

    us, our bodies. He made sexual organ that go active at the age of 13 at most.
    Our religion say, get your youth married when they are sexually ripe. In Pakistan,
    youth are being crushed in the society and they get married well in their thirties.
    Some people say even Masturbation is "Haram" in our relgion. Somebody just tell
    me what would you do between the ages of 16 to 30. What would you do for 14 years
    god damn it. Sex is a human need and it is a healthy activity. If it was in my

    england after living theire some years. I do not think those movies are strange.
    I bet any person, boy or girl, you and me, will do exactly the same  if we were
    at there place. It is human nature folks. \r\nIn pakistan we people are MUNAFIQS.
    we are MUNAFEQEENS because  our actions and our belifs are totally opposite.Those
    in net cafes did a minor sin. Infact it is their love, or action they did because
    thery are human beings. \r\n\r\nDo you kill a male cat fucking a female cat in
    your house infront of your family just becuase male cat fucked and raped the cat.
    Do you kill the same male cat fucking another femal cat. No you do not because
    you say these are animals.\r\nThen why the fuck you kill human beings, poor women,
    in name of KAROO KARI, or honour killing where she did the act in private and
    with  consent. While the male fucker gets away. This is MUNAFQAT.\r\n\r\nThe blackmailers
    and hidden cameras are the real culpurits. Please every one stop saying ISLAM
    ISLAM ISLAM. Before becoming a Muslim, we should become a human being not an animal.\r\n\r\nIf
    a boy and girl does something with consent it should not b a big deal. Girls living
    in pakistan are mostly exploited by blackmailers. The problem is that we , pakistanis
    are cauught up in a paradox of old text book Islamic thoughts  we received by
    the MULLAS and reality. Islam is till day of judjment. Even in ISLAM is the concept
    of IJTEHAD. ISLAM is for every time which means the most intellectual , charactered
    and edjucated persons  with knowledge of ISLAM should do IJTEHAD. Which means
    moulding or using the same ISLAMIC tool in a different way. Means common sense
    says all over the world Muslims are getting beaten up just because of our MUNAFIQ
    Judiacial systems in our own countries. Women gets more respect in non sulim countries
    then in Muslim countries.\r\n\r\nThere should b a respectable laws for women.
    There should be an independent welfare centers for women all over the country.
    Where the women from any family, rich or poor tak shelter. Then there should b
    a HARDCORE STRICT LAW SYSTEM as in u.k. Where some one can not DARE to stare a
    women even if she is walking naked on London roads. Because if that woman complaint
    and call cops and tell them that man staring at me. the man will be put in jail.
    This is JUSTICE. Justice is the right of every human being whether, Muslim, Hindu,
    Sikh etc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Pakistanis are the world most highest hypocrates
    where men fuck girls and call girsl outside their houses and kill their own daughters
    for KAARO KARI, if she develops a relationship. WHY?\r\n\r\nPLZ PLZ PLZ, we should
    first develop a society based on justice then gradually bring the society towards
    REAL ISLAM. \r\nHazrat Ali said, ITS MAFHOOM IS, a fair judicial system of KUFR
    will survive while an unfair judiacial system of Truthfulness will fail.\r\n\r\nMy
    deep deep condolences for the poor victims, girls who were murderded by this MUNAFIQ
    SOCIETY of PAKISTAN.\r\n\r\nIN SEARCH OF JUSTICE FOR A NEW PAKISTAN,"

    very clearly, 90% of children want to try out everything in this world. they want
    to learn everything in this world. when sex becomes a mystery they want to try/find  it
    out. sex is a natural instinct. and the parents do those filthy things or not
    their youngs want to do it. u can lock all the girls in the community inside ur
    home,still some one will elope or have incest inside the home ,as it is a body
    instinct. better learn obout ur body instincts and learn to control it as human
    beings should do and then teach about sex to ur siblings. just by killing a child
    the parent shows he is not a literate human being. u can never imply anything
    for long in this world by tyranny. through love and education the so called islamic
    countries can win their childs heart and then the world.

  content: "Asalami-e-alikam friends.\nI read the comments given here. All persons
    have different view and argument. But according to my point of view following
    are the responsible of this incident ,First of all parents, Media and Social evils.
    \nMy question is that why parents do not check regularly that what his or  her
    child do. what kind of its interest , and how they spent there free time.  My
    request to all of parents that must make strong attachness with their childrens,
    and convey to the childrens that you are not lonely, and regulary asked their
    studies.\nAccording to my observation presently of youth feel  lonelyness that
    nobody is interested in his affairs, Every one becomes selfish today, Everyone
    talk about their issu just and don't think that another expect what from it.\nSecond
    thing is media espacielly electronic media.Because they have a number channels
    promoting Vulgarity in the society and unfortunately educated people take , much
    interest in these channels programs and dramas. Everyone knows about it. Even
    our news channels are alos playing importent part in this vulgarity by advertising
    naked body commersials numbers of time in 24 hours. In these what kind youth you
    can expect from this society will produced.\n \n                                                                        One
    Most importent thing i want to add in my disscussion.\nI request to all of  parents
    plz plz pay huge attention to the Religious Education  of their childrens to make
    him/her a great muslim and feed of good sociel society. \n\n               Remember
    all these points when someone Become parents. I think it would be helpfull for
    them."

  content: I think  the owner of the net cafe is fully responsible  for this incident.
    Why had he created an opportunity for the visitors of the net cafe by providing
    them with the doors which could be locked from inside? I would say that it was
    his intention to make some situation of this kind. If the young boys n girls of
    our country r given any chance of this kind , they would certainly pounce upon
    that. I stand him responsible for that n he should b punished in such a way that
    none other may ever think of committing such act.

  content: I guess nobody is listening to your caveat about keeping moralizing to
    a minimum :D.  The internet cafe owner layout cabins was clearly the spider laying
    out his web for the 'flies'.  There is no real solution other than being vigilant.  Every
    individual will be called upon to make a moral choice times and again.  And one
    will falter now and then.  Having seen so many people of different faiths, I can
    say that no one can claim to be better than the other.  It all boils down to what
    basic character you have.  And I feel there is the same percentage of good, middling,
    bad in all communities.  The creation of Pakistan - bunching together of people
    of one community - is itself faulty.  Does not the Quran says that if God willed
    all humans to be of one community he would have made them one?  Which means we
    have to live with different communities inharmony and not strife.

<p>Net caf&Atilde;&copy;s do amazing business in Pakistan. In the 80s, the easiest way to keep your wayward son employed was to open up a PCO (Public Call Office) in the neighborhood. You rent a shop, install a phoneline, a desk and a chair. People come and pay you 10 rupees to make a phone call. Easy money. </p>
<p>Those PCOs were converted into internet access points (no beverages are served on premises) by late 90s. In 1998, a rough survey of Lahore produced an average on 10-12 caf&Atilde;&copy;s per neighborhoods. Now, that ratio is to one per street. </p>
<p>Surfing for information for yesterday's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/_and_cricket_is_haram_anyways.html"> post</a>, I came across this <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/apr2004-daily/28-04-2004/editorial/col3.htm">editorial in Jang Daily</a> from April 28th. It told a story of internet, sex and exploitation gone horribly wrong (as opposed to all the times it goes wonderfully right, i guess). I translate:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<div id="blockquoted"> <b><center> These Net Caf&Atilde;&copy;s by Jawaid Chaudhry </center></b></p>
<p>In a Rawalpindi market, two years ago, someone set up a Net Caf&Atilde;&circ;; he constructed small cabins, placed computers in them, put a screen door with locks on the inside, installed lights in the ceiling and hidden in the lights, installed cameras. After the grand opening, young men and women started to patronize the establishment. They came alone or as couples, went into the cabins and viewed "dirty" websites on the computers. The owners of the establishment recorded these activities and would later show the movies to the couples and blackmail them for dirty deeds. This carried on until around 25 couples were ensared. A CD was compiled and send to Dubai where it sold for 10 lakh (about $100,000). Copies were made and sold in Britain, US, France and Germany and finally, made their way back home. In the beginning, these CDs were sold for four or five thousand rupees in Lahore and Islamabad. A gang got hold of the CD and tracked down the 25 families of the couples. They delivered the CDs to those houses. This caused an instant firestrom. <b>Three of the girls in the scandal committed suicide. One was killed by her father. Two were divorced </b>. While the boys ran away from their houses. Some of the young men on the CD belonged to very prominent families of Rawalpindi. These houses fell prey to blankmailing from the gang.</p>
<p>One of the elders from these families came to me. His only child had killed herself. He was in extremely fragile condition. He told me the whole story and cried that these monsters have destroyed entire families. Please tell the government to take pity on us and stop the violence permeated in the guise of technology. The gentleman left me and I don't know if he is still alive or not but his problem remains genuine.  There are thousands of Net Caf&Atilde;&copy;s in this country. Most have cabins. Young boys and girls from colleges and universities go to these caf&Atilde;&copy;s, open "dirty" sites and embark on the path of sin and destruction where many blackmailers are sitting. If the Government pays serious attention, this can be resolved easily. There are thousands of software in the world that eliminate obscene websites. The Pakistan government should install these filters on all internet services, register all Net Caf&Atilde;&copy;s, issue license of operations, impound unlicensed sites, and ban the use of cameras in all such facilities. In the meantime, all cabins should be abolished. Proprieters should be told to prohibit morally corrupt sites and movies on the premises and teams of enforcers should tour and arrest non-compliant owners.</p>
<p>Someone else was telling me that some stores have installed cameras in their "try rooms". Some export these films overseas and exploit the children. The government should also pass laws against cameras in changing rooms. Places where cameras are installed should notify the customers via a public sign board. I have seen many places in Europe, America and Canada where they are installed as traffic camers. In USA, it is against the law to record any image or movie without permission even voice recording. In America, even a president, Richard Nixon, lost his government when he secretly taped his opponents but there os no such laws in our country. People have put secret cameras and recorders everywhere and their phone calls even are taped and used later for blackmail. No one knows how many houses have been destroyed by this.</p>
<p>[i snip the rest] </p></div>
<p>The interesting thing here is that the author, in the case of Net Caf&Atilde;&copy;s, wants to regulate the internet itself but, in the case of changing rooms, is satisfied with laws against hidden cameras. Presumably, the same law against hidden recording should solve the Caf&Atilde;&copy; crime as well as the changing room crime. </p>
<p>The divergence in his solution comes from an old-and-tried argument that television, cinema, western books (and now the internet) are mere conduits of sin and depravity for the youth of Pakistan. The corruption occurs by mere exposure. Hence, the lack of appropriate laws is not enough as the depravity will continue in the Caf&Atilde;&copy;. They argue, that what needs to happen is a control over the flow of unchecked smut. In case of Pakistan, that means regulating the internet, in case of USA, it means going to the <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071-5171076.html"> source</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to state that the blackmailing industry hinted at in the editorial is, without a doubt, prevalent and pernicious in segments of the population. It is largely due to the fact that even a <em>rumor</em> can destroy the life of girl. Families have no choice but to comply with the blackmailers to prevent something like that from happening. The way to break that hold is to shift the blame from the victim to the oppressors. A girl who dates, or has an affair is not Evil Incarnate. She should NOT be killed or stoned. sigh.</p>
<p>P.S. While looking around for information on the Pakistani Net Caf&Atilde;&copy; scene, I got this <a href="http://jazz.ipadder.com/2760.php">entry </a> by a pakistani blogger also looking at the same issue - and more <a href="http://jazz.ipadder.com/2947.php"> here. </a></p>
<p><b>update [May 24, 2004]:</b>I am going to temporarily suspend comments on this entry as the discourse seems to be in a downward spiral of righteous religiosity and morally-sanctioned retribution. To be frank, I am quite disturbed by some of these comments and almost deleted them. However, I will let them stand to testify to the shamelessly premodern conceptions of an individual human still prevalent in Pakistani society.</p>
<p><b>update</b>: comments are reopened but please keep moralizing to a minimum.</p>
