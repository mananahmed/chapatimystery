  content: "This is, of course, not the end, nor even the beginning of the end, but
    it is the end of the beginning. Personally, I foresee the most serious threats
    to the evolution of a better, more democratic order (and i hasten to add that
    my standards are not high: Indian style corruption ridden democracy would be enough
    for a start) to come from 4 interconnected forces: 1. The intelligence agencies
    that became the unaccountable masters of the state under army rule and which still
    have potential for mischief. Those who are simply corrupt are not the biggest
    threat. They can readjust to new realities and continue with several kinds of
    financial corruption in a more democratic, civilian led order. But there are still
    ideologically motivated cadres in these agencies who see their role in messianic
    terms and will not easily cease their various conspiracies or give up their proxies. 2.
    The MQM, which has real public support and ability, but may find it hard to adjust
    to even minimal rule of law. They are not an insoluble problem though. With some
    delicate handling and (this is a bitter cup for most of us, but may have to be
    swallowed)  if not pressed too hard on May 12th, they may yet opt to function
    semi-reasonably in a pakistani context. But Its not going to be easy... 3.
    The US embassy: Ambassador Anne Patterson has not exactly covered herself with
    glory in this matter. Even if one accepts (and many pakistanis do not) that their
    intentions are not all bad, their micromanagement of Pakistani politics is not
    good for pakistan. I am not privy to any confidential details, but from outside
    it does NOT look like they have moved much beyond the \"drinks whisky, so he must
    be pro-western\" level at which they used to operate in the sixties (as shown
    in declassified documents) 4. The jihadis. If the first 3 problems are solved,
    this problem can be solved as well (at least in Punjab and SIndh). Terrorism will
    remain a threat for years, and not just in Pakistan. But a stronger state with
    more transparent security agencies will have a much better chance to contain them."

  content: "Someone on our blog wrote to say that \"we have only had 60 years to build
    democracy\" and defended the US embassy as a force for good.  I thought my reply
    may be relevant to my earlier comment here... I dont buy this \"it took them
    60 years\" argument. We (as humans) have been on this planet for the same amount
    of time. The fact is, continuous ham-handed interference from the US embassy
    has contributed negatively to many of our biggest problems. Forget about all they
    do in pursuit of their interests in the region,  EVEN when they want to fix things,
    they tend to make a mess, because their assessment is so pathetic.  I know
    that our elite (all of us), left to its own devices, is capable of amazing errors
    and flights of fancy. So, for that matter, is our underclass, but they have less
    power to act on whatever mistaken notions they may have. But this is not unique
    to Pakistan. It is a common human problem (look at the number of Indian commentators
    who are apparently bowled over by Musharraf). We all make mistakes and stupid
    statements. I make them all the time. And we will never agree about which mistakes
    are the worst and which statements are the most foolish. But clearly there are
    some things about which I know a little more and many things about which I know
    less. The US embassy and its staff, almost by definition, know LESS than is needed
    (but more than is good for us). Having said that, I am sure there will be occasions
    when I will go around wishing the US embassy does A or pushes B."
