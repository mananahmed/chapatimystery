<p>Last week I gave a small talk to a group of Model UN students at Hildesheim U. Thought I'd archive the presentation - and share it here. Not much going on. My main concern was to show the difference between internal and external public/policy debates*. And maybe also to step away from (inter)national narratives. I didn't have any pre-written remarks so, you can play karaoke with the slides and just imagine what I said. I am sure long-time readers (and frequent callers) will have no problem. I am a broken record.</p>

<p>*The Kerry slide was a complete dud. I need local political quotes.</p>
