    From the news that I have followed, it doesn't seem just like a fundraising issue. While a lot less money has been given than is needed, there is a lack of supplies, especially tents etc., as well. I guess the first thing to consider is what would be the best thing we should do. Send money or specific supplies?

    If you want to organize a blog fundraising day, then let's go for it. Let's get as many bloggers involved as we can, especially a few of the somewhat bigger names (by which I mean bloggers with lots of visitors).

    BTW, how's your fundraising after the initial burst?

  content: "Zack: you are right that supplies is becoming the crucial thing - tents/medical
    etc. Sending those over, obviously, is quite a tough task that only organizations
    can undertake. Bloggers, can only raise awareness and money. I have from checks
    and online donations - collected $2000 since I posted last Saturday.  Can you
    identify who the big bloggers are? Instapundit? Atrios? JMM? They are all busy
    with Fitzmas. dKos? or desi-centric like Sepia Mutiny. They had a post today as
    well on doing something collective."

    bringing/urging people to move in temporarily while their homes are being  rebuilt.

  content: I think we have to somehow get the popular media involved again. The story
    is starting to fading off the US front pages. Not sure how to do this.(maybe send
    them emails urging them to try and keep helping, help them get news from the across
    the globe..anything.). We need to somehow make this event  have the same grip
    as the Katrina event.

  content: "Sepoy: OPEN (www.opensiliconvalley.com) sent out an email this morning
    to its members requesting them to write letters to the UK Government and NATO
    to assign more helicopters to the relief efforts. The text of the email is below.
    The form letter for NATO can be found at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/buxea\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/buxea</a> and for the UK government at <a
    href=\"http://tinyurl.com/e3vkt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tinyurl.com/e3vkt</a> --- Folks,\n
    \nWith the worst affected areas in northern Pakistan remaining largely inaccessible,
    the ONLY way to rescue the injured and to get humanitarian and medical aid to
    the remaining survivors before the start of winter is by using helicopters.  Pakistan's
    most critical needs remain: (1) helicopters to carry aid and rescue the injured,
    and (2) winterized tents. The U.S. Government has reacted very positively and
    allocated more helicopters to the aid effort to reach a total of 30. While there
    are an estimated 60 helicopters operational and another 20 in the pipeline, aid
    agencies estimate that at least another 70 helicopters are required to save lives
    before it is too late.\n \nWE MUST REACH OUT TO GOVERNMENTS AND NATO TO SOLVE
    THIS CRISIS. Here is what you can do: \n \n1. Please write to the British Prime
    Minister Tony Blair requesting that he allocate more British helicopters to the
    aid effort. At the moment, Britain has only allocated 3 of its own helicopters
    to the aid effort.\n \nDownload the form letter and customize it with your address,
    the date and name. A customized letter will have greater impact. Feel free to
    personalize it further but please maintain a respectful tone at all times.\n \nThere
    are two ways to send the letter to Tony Blair:\n \n i) Email: Once you customize
    the letter, copy and paste it into the Web email form at <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page821.asp.\"

    Affairs\" from the drop-down menu.\n \n ii) Fax: Once you customize and sign the
    letter, fax it to Prime Minister Blair at 011-44-2079250918. \n \n2. Please write
    to the NATO Secretary-General requesting that he and the NATO Ambassadors assign
    NATO's helicopter assets to the aid effort.  \n \nDownload the form letter and
    customize it with your address, the date and name. A customized letter will have
    greater impact. Feel free to personalize it further but please maintain a respectful
    tone at all times. \n \nThere are two ways to send the letter to the NATO Secretary-General:\n

    In the subject header, please write \"For the attention of the NATO Secretary-General
    regarding Pakistan earthquake relief\".\n \nii) Fax: Once you customize and sign
    the letter, fax it to  the Secretary-General at 011-322-7074117 or 011-322-7071252.\n

    Asalamu'alaikum,

    &Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    We are now only collecting monetary donations, medical supplies, and tents, as these are the most urgently needed goods in Pakistan right now.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; The Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati has set up a fund at all 5th/3rd Banks, under the name "Islamic Center Pakistan Earthquake Fund".&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; Please donate generously.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    &Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    We are also working with NGOs that have arranged a contract from a factory in China that has agreed to ship army tents to Pakistan at a minimal cost.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; We urgently need people to agree to purchase as many tents as possible. &Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; Each tent costs $75, can hold 5-7 people at a time, and is wind, rain, & snow proof.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; The tents will be ready and delivered within a weeks time.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; Upon delivery, UNICEF is coordinating the ground efforts to distribute the tents in coordination&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;with the US & Pakistan military.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; Tents are in extreme shortage & are needed ASAP.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; Please donate generously to purchase these tents.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp; We will be keeping track of the orders that are placed and received in Pakistan, so please be assured that the process will be legitimate and transparent.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    &Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    The official order for the tents&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;must be placed within the next 11 hours, so we need to collect as many individual orders for tents as we can within the next few hours.&Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
    &Acirc;&not;&Acirc;&uml;&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;

    <i>Can you identify who the big bloggers are? Instapundit? Atrios? JMM?</i>

    I had in mind someone who has a large number of readers, let's say about 10,000 visits a day or more. Preferably someone outside of desis (so word gets to more people and communities) but even a desi would do.

    Your idea of a Blog Day for this sounds good. A good thing would be to get lots of bloggers (in different blogging communities) to participate.
