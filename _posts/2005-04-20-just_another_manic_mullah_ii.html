  content: "But how many copies of that would ve been sold before all this publicity
    it's been given now? Now it has got all the attention ... perhaps ... it was looking
    for. \n\nAnother interesting incident that happened today was the arrest of Moulana
    Sami Ul Haq (who was/is a big supporter of Taliban) at Brussels airport but was
    released later on. And they refused to meet that delegation because Moulana was
    part of it. \n\nI really dont understand why that Mullah wanted to be in Brussles
    in first place? And secondly who named him in that delegation who was supposed
    to meet EU's Foreign Relations Committee. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.geo.tv/main_files/pakistan.aspx?id=74229\"

  content: "Dear colleagues,\r\nas the librarian for South Asian Studies at Columbia
    University (in New York), I would like to try to track down and acquire a copy
    of the book referred to (Iblis ki Aulad  OR Puttar Shaitan Da) here. Columbi has
    an excellent collection (in Urdu, Punjabi, and many other languages) of deep and
    detailed research materials on Pakistan and the other countries of South Asia.
    (We host the Quaid-e-Azam Chair in Pakistan Studies here). So I would like to
    augment our collection with this fairly obscure book. I am not promoting the book
    (of course), nor detracting it,  but I am trying to do a dilligent job of tracking
    down resources like this, which will be of interest to our scholars of Islam,
    South Asia, Muslims in the world, etc.  If anyone has any information on how I
    can purchase a copy for our library, please contact me at magier@columbia.edu\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks and bahut shukria.\r\n\r\nDavid Magier"

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/mullah.jpg">Some crazy mullah in Norway has written a book in Urdu titled <i>Iblis ki Aulad [Sons of Satan]</i>. The book is being <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1021435.ece">sold</a>, surreptitiously, on the streets of Oslo. The outfit behind the book is <i>All Pakistan Muslim Society</i>. What they are doing in Norway is up to debate. Unless "All Pakistan" includes Norway, now. Which would be right what the Olive Pope warned us <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/ECEE591F-A4ED-46BE-8784-1459F23710E2.htm">against</a>. </p>
<p>Here are some choice <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1692534,00.html">quotes</a> from the book. It is silly pablum. Yet, it needs to be read and combatted. I cannot really find any more on the group or the book but I wanted to climb on my soap-box and proclaim that the coming <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/international/worldspecial2/12islam.html?ex=1270958400&en=9699469c6e7bded1&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Crusaders</a> will never find me <a href="http://michaelnicknichols.com/gallery/ndoki/">here</a>. </p>
<p>More seriously, the issue of migrant populations in Europe - especially the Scandinavian countries - is bound to escalate up the charts in the coming months. I have some family of my own in Sweden and I hope that they can move forward in a safe and welcoming environment. On the Muslim leadership front, we need to have public officials ready to combat such manic mullahs. Paging Tariq Ramadan.</p>
