    it's the other way round Army supports them to destabilizes

  content: The key thing about this gathering is that it was organized by the JUP,
    which means that the ulama in attendance were largely from the Barelwi orientation.
    Given that, their condemnation of the Taliban and of radical militancy (which
    also targets the religious institutions of the Barelwi, Shi'a, Sufis, etc) is
    hardly very surprising. The Deobandi groups refused to participate. The English
    press is very bad at picking up on these distinctions.

  content: "What, no historical perspective? \"Ulama and Mashaikh conventions\" were
    organized by the British starting in the first world war and were a regular feature
    whenever the state needed some mullahs for hire. This practice continued after
    partition. The JUP has long since become irrelevant in Pakistani politics (currently,
    not even one seat in parliament, if I am not mistaken). They are also barelvis
    and have their own beef with the salafi/wahabi/deobandi whatever. But the crucial
    element is the state. If the ISI wants an Ulama and Mashaikh convention to support
    Indian rule in Kashmir, they will invite the same people and get them to sign
    on the dotted line.  I do agree that this is still a good idea. Propaganda
    is a necessary part of war and though these guys have ZERO traction in the jihadi
    world, they will serve to convince some members of the elite that the battle in
    Swat is not against islam,  since some islamic looking guys on TV were supporting
    it. That is about all it means though..."

  content: "Re: \"The JUP has long since become irrelevant in Pakistani politics (currently,
    not even one seat in parliament, if I am not mistaken). \"  I disagree with
    the import of this comment, for a couple of reasons:  1.  I imagine sepoy
    did not reference this gathering for its parliamentary/electoral relevance, but
    for its cultural/\"hearts-and-minds\" relevance; the point being that this sort
    of gathering lends cultural authenticity to the anti-Taliban ideological struggle
    (whether it IN FACT does or not, or whether these chaps will be seen as clerics-for-hire,
    or just as Barelvis settling scores, is a different question.  But the answers
    to these questions do not turn on the JUP's strength in parliament).  2.
    \ To not have a seat in parliament is not the same thing as to be politically
    irrelevant.  Let's take an extreme example: the Pakistani army has no seat in
    parliament."

  content: PS-- nor is this sort of thing confined to Barelvis.  The Dar-ul-Uloom
    at Deoband in India has issued a number of pronouncements condemning suicide attacks,
    terrorism, violence against civilians, over the last few years.  Indeed, during
    the Indo-Pak peace process some were even requested to travel to the NWFP in pakistan
    to explain to Taliban-types why this sort of thing was not consistent with Deobandi
    tenets as the Dar-ul-uloom understood them.  [That these missions don't seem to
    have worked tells us either that Deobandi tenets are susceptible to multiple interpretations;
    or that "settling" theological questions is not going to get very far in combatting
    a movement that, while it sees itself as religious and political, is not reducible
    to theological niceties.  Likely both.]

  content: "Neither the taliban nor the pak army have any seats in parliament.  But
    then, neither is interested in even asking for such a seat. That is not their
    nature. These are armed groups and they project their power by more direct means.
    But the JUP is a political party and has been for 60 years. They did have a few
    seats for a while (Noorani, and that person from mianwali). Now, they cannot even
    win a municipal election. I think that means something. The Jamat Islami (to
    give a counter example) has seats in parliament (NA as well as senate), and till
    a few years ago had an elected mayor in Karachi. And beyond that, they have very
    powerful trade unions and student unions. JUP has neither. I agreed with the
    \"cultural/hearts and minds\" comment but tried to hint that the audience for
    this \"hearts and minds\" thing is mostly a certain section of the pakistani elite
    who want to paper over the contradiction between their supposed allegiance to
    Islamic superpowerdom (\"pakistan islam ka kilaa, jihad fee sabeel illah) and
    their current elite interest in standing alongside the US embassy in a war against
    those fighting for the \"purest version\" of this Islam ka qilaa. The demographic
    who are not impressed at all with these ulama and mashaikh conventions is the
    Islamists: the kind of people who are seriously working for an \"islamic state\".
    Just go around and check if the local islamists are  impressed with this collection
    of beards and islamic leaders....what I am saying is \"these people have no street
    cred\" among the islamists. ...And very little credibility in any other large
    segment of society. Still, they have some propaganda value overseas and among
    the elite (our friends and cousins, the ones who are NOT islamists but are \"normal\").
    To that extent, they are worth the effort..."

  content: "Fair points omar, your clarification is helpful.  [Off-topic: the
    Jamaat probably won that mayor seat in Karachi only because the MQM boycotted
    that election; the next time around, even though the Jamaat mayor was praised
    for the good work he had done, he was beaten, as the MQM did not repeat their
    boycott.]"

  content: "\"Just go around and check if the local islamists are impressed with this

    Islamists would be the goal of this gathering and your analysis may be close to
    the point on military providing room and board, as Zia Ul Haq regularly had Shura
    meetings which less or more looked like this . One way of looking at this picture
    is  to  show ,how superficial it is for the  modern media to put a picture of
    ferrocious looking bearded males and caption it any way they like. While ignoring
    those who do not fit the bill. I am afraid that someday the media here in USA
    might be running this picture with the caption \"Taliban take over Parliament
    bulding in Isalmabad\""

<p>Above is a big hall full of bearded Muslims. Not just any Muslims, but members of the <i>Jama'at-e Ulema</i>. They are gathered, and this is where it becomes a little scary folks, to <i>condemn</i> the Taliban. I know, right? Apparently, this has been going on <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-ulema-against-taliban-hs-03">for some time</a>. At this particular gathering, they denounced the Taliban, agreed with the Swat operation and demanded that Sufi Muhammad be tried as a traitor. They announced a new movement: "Go Taliban Go America" (how you like that association?). They even asked that the Baluchistan crisis be solved (politically) and stressed that the Army stop its insane killings in Baluchistan. </p>
<p>Now, I point this out merely to demonstrate that just as all "Taliban" are not created equal, all "Mullah" aren't either. The bad news, of course, is that they continued to support the Pakistani army and continued their call for a "Nizam-e Mustafa" (the order of the Prophet) in the country. Suuure. </p>
