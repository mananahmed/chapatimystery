  content: "Re: Gaza, today is the National Call In Day for Gaza. Time for a bit of
    grassroots activism ourselves!  I am cutting and pasting some suggestions
    I received via e-mail, and do give the Obama transition team a phone call. I did
    so, and the dude was nice enough to say he will \"forward my message of concern.\"
    I know this is a standard, non-committal response, but hey, I tried.   <blockquote>National
    Call-In Day for Gaza! January 16, 2009  We designate Friday, January
    16th as National Call-In Day for Gaza. Calling is quick, easy, and effective,
    and will take about 5-10 minutes. We need to keep the phones ringing non-stop
    for the duration of the day so that our message CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED.  Contact
    in order of importance:  1) Call President-Elect Obama's
    Transition Team at 202-540-3000. Ask that President-Elect Obama and his team
    call for: 1) An immediate cease-fire. 2) An end to the blockade and siege
    of Gaza. 3) An immediate withdrawal from Gaza.  Be firm and polite and
    stress the fact that over a thousand people have died and thousands have been
    injured in Gaza, mainly civilians. This follows months of suffering under a severe
    blockade that has resulted in shortages of food, fuel and basic medical supplies.
    When calling, mention (UN Security Council Resolution 1860 that was adopted last
    week which calls for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access.  2)
    Call your Representative at 202-224-3121. Ask how they voted on House Resolution
    34 which passed overwhelmingly in the House last Friday, with 390 Representatives
    voting yes, 5 no, and 22 present. The resolution \"recognizes Israel's right to
    defend itself\" and \"reaffirms the United States' strong support
    for Israel.\"  If your Representative voted \"no\" or \"present\" on H.Res.
    34, thank them and ask that they cosponsor Rep. Kucinich's upcoming resolution. (See:
    http://endtheoccupation.org/downloads/KUCINI_001_xml.pdf)  If your representative
    voted \"yes\" on H.Res. 34 state your disagreement with their vote and ask them
    to co-sponsor the Kucinich resolution.  3) Call your Senators at 202-224-3121
    and assert your disagreement with their unanimous vote on Senate Resolution 10
    and ask that they introduce a resolution in the Senate that is similar to Rep.
    Kucinich's resolution in the House.  Please forward this to all your lists
    and personally contact 10 friends and urge them to make these calls to save lives
    in Gaza.</blockquote>"

  content: Ha. Well, I just meant that in the ye old bookstores there aren't very
    many Urdu studies books - whether critics, poetics or literary studies. Dunno
    if those PhDs are not being written or not being published. Will report specifics
    if I can unearth any.

  content: Have you read S. Zameer Hasan Dehlavi's book "Dehlavi Urdu"? It's written
    in Urdu and was published by "Urdu Academy, Delhi" in 2000. From what I hear,
    it is a wonderful history of the birth of Urdu in Delhi and it explores some of
    the literary trends of that time. I've tried to read it, but I do not yet have
    the linguistic skill to absorb the *truly exquisite* Dehlavi Urdu that the author
    writes in. You may enjoy it however.
