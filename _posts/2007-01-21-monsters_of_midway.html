  content: "Sadly missed the game, since I was occupied hunting for OUP books in Bangalore.
    it's such a futile exercise, Cubs winning for my money have a greater chance of
    being successful. Pakistan need another 47 at this time with 5 wickets in hand.
      hey, hey, let us go to Miami."

<p><img src="/img/dabears.jpg" width="140">Alright! I gotta say that was an nicely intense game made all the more glorious by the constant Joe Kitnafication of Rex Grossman. We missed pdcs' commentary and recall of stats for all players. But, I am sure he will land in Oakland soon to the good news that his Bears are going to Miami.</p>
