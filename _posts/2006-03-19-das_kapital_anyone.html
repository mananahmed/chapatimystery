  content: "If u wanna know if Das Kapital changed something, yeah it gave us symbol
    'K' in economics for capital and reserved 'C' for consumption.   Mankiw
    wrote: \"Marx prdicted that the return to capital would decline over time and
    that this would lead to economic and political crises. Economic history has not
    supported Marx's prediction, which partly explains why we study Solow's theory
    of (economic) growth rather than Marx's.\""
