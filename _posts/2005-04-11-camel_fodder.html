  content: It's interesting how the Gulf News article that you link to doesn't even
    mention the issue of human rights concerning the child jockeys. I watched a documentary/TV
    show last year here in the US that showed the efforts of Ansar Burney, a Pakistani
    human rights activist, to try and campaign for the release of these children.
    The footage that he managed to obtain from the UAE was shocking. I'm surprised
    that more noise hasn't been made about this? I grew up in the Persian Gulf and
    never even heard about it until I moved to the US and saw it on TV.

  content: i worked auditing labor standards in clothing factories in south asia.
    we saw some bad stuff, however, nothing compared to the horrendous conditions
    and abuse we saw in dubai. most of the workers in the factories are sri lankan/bangladeshi/indian/or
    pakistani. a few (required by law) are actually from the uae. the arabs worked
    in separate rooms, with wonderful amenities, and far less pressure. whereas the
    south asians worked in sweaty little boxes facing beatings, curses, and what i
    would consider torture. sadly, there aren't even monitoring agencies in the region
    and all the auditors had to be brought in from south asia. i could go on, but
    i think you get the picture.

  content: Yet another reason as to why I don't want to move to Dubai.  On the plus
    side, I suppose one could see the replacement of children with robots as...progressive...?  Sort
    of?  At least we know they're not Luddites.

    I have watched the weekly and annual camel races in QATAR for many years and even visited the camps where the camel are kept and the so called JOCKEYS, poor and innocent children who sacrifice their life and future to please the wealthy. The racing camels cost Millions of Riyals and are very well looked after. This is a very common festivity in the Gulf states. The annual race between GCC countries attracts many and the prizes of Golden swords and millions of Riyals are offered to the winners. The Emir sponsors these occasions and distribute the prizes.
    What is happening in GCC states, what are the plights and conditions of the Expatriate labour, Engineers; Doctors and domestic servants:  it is appauling and dreadful.
    These are the worst example of human dignity and honour being disgraced but the most interesing thing is that all the people who love to enter and work in these Islamic states, for better money and living conditions, get insults and discriminations by the sponsors ( KAFEELS )
    The 9/11 tragedy, though horrrible,  had the result of deportation of many who were living there illegally for many years and also raised a hue and cry and dangerous alarms of abuse of human rights. But we have yet to get the real picture of discrimination and violation of human rights in these GCC states. One wonders why people have ignored that for so many decades and have been happily trying to enter the land of Riyals and Dirhams and Dinars. Perhaps those who got Riyals have the right to enjoy the type of entertainment, they can afford.
    We should safeguard our interests and keep away to be victimised. Most of the children are abducted by interested groups from south asian countries and smuggled into GCC states and put on camel back to drive the Land Crusiser...the favourite of many with true choice to kill himself or survive ??? WHO CARES IF AN INNOCENT LIFE IS DESTROYED IN THE DESERT OF AMUSEMENT. These views are expressed with out prejudice to anyone and based on facts.

    Hi,
       I agree with you about the treatment meted out to people from South Asia in the Middle East. One of my friends who lived there for quite a while told me that there is essentially a racial hierarchy in place. My fondest wish is that the tables be soon turned. The UAE and other middle eastern nations base a large portion of their economy on expat labour. Hopefully with the rising economic muscle of India, and hopefully soon the rest of South Asia, the middle east nations will soon be in a position where they have to "improve" their relations with South Asia and will not be able to survive on expat labour. At least with the UAE, its oil reserves are not what they were, and this is very useful in leverage.

  content: "It is true that in UAE....  ...ther is racism against south-asians.
    Stereotyping and calling names by the nationals or other Arabs or common.   ...person
    from a western nation gets treated better than an asian in Dubai.  ...Has
    seperate que in the airport for south asians at the arrival  ... You will
    be probably mistreated as an asian at a high end shop like Armani or Prada, provided
    the salesman blocks you right at the entrance and tells you not to enter by posing
    questions like \"Excuse me! can I help you? Can u afford?\" The Armani in twin
    towers, Deira, dubai is an example.  ... Lebanese, Palestinians and Egyptians
    generally refer South Asian immigrants as somebody below them  ...  pakistanis
    are stinking people and only makes taxi driver according to many in Dubai  ...
    there is an aparthied colony in Dubai where only white people can rent houses
    places in areas like Jumeirah.  ... For many years the Irish pub (like handful
    of others)  was only open to Europeans or people who looks like europeans. Like
    a lebanese friend of mine from Golan passed off as a french man many times, I
    was stopped and asked to leave on the grounds of bieng Indian. And when confronted
    he remarked \"who cares for browny dogs\"  ...All the menial jobs are exclusively
    reserved for (Malabari) a racist word for anyone who looks Indian, Bengali, Pakistani,
    Srilankan, Philipino etc.,  ...every philipino, russian and central asian
    women are whores  ...children used for camel races are poor muslim children
    from south asian countrie, this generally shows the Gulf Arabs has no value for
    human life  ...Women has no voting rights  ... As a south asian my
    passport is held by a sponsor who can drive me into slave labour and get away
    with it  ... Till recently the courts had known to be siding the Arab citizens
    in labour related cases  ...you have no freedom of expression, right of
    speech.  ... This is the second country who recognized Taliban as a government
    and now desperately trying to cover up the folly to Impress there Western allies  ...
    I was racially abused for more than 50 times in 3 years. Example: An east european
    woman wont serve me coffee at Diera mall saying she doesn't have the particular
    order. But, serves it to western looking man next table. When confronted, \"She
    just brushed it away by grimmacing at me\", Supprisingly she was a Philipino."

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/cameljockey.jpg">Following Qatar's <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=11612">lead</a>, UAE has decided to replace <a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com/?p=1053">kidnapped</a> South Asian children with <a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/Articles/NationNF.asp?ArticleID=160092">robots</a> as jockeys in the most popular camel races.</p>
<p>Camel racing is as old as the two oldest bedouins with camels and a long stretch of desert turf. In the Roman accounts of Syria and the Hadramawt, there are mentions of horse and camel races as the sports du jour. Kidnapping children from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan is fairly new, I guess. I am sure other slaves from other climes filled this unspectactular role in times past. I further venture to guess that this news is welcome. Robots for children - and let us have a round of applause for the enlightenment sweeping across the Gulf region.</p>
<p>I hesitate to let out my full bile on the sub-human status of expats from South and East Asia in the Gulf. Anyone there can tell you about the <i>muwattin</i> [citizens] and the <i>wafid</i> [newcomer]. Suffice to say, that the oasis in the desert that is Dubai or Doha was watered by blood of these workers. And I mean that literally. With the barest of rights and at the mercy of the intemperate <i>kafil</i> [citizen-sponsor for every migrant], the migrant faces incredible racism and exploitation. The citizen gets everything - first - while <a href="/img/scorn.jpg">open scorn</a> [and physical violence] is reserved for those that are building the <i>Burj al-Dubai</i>. Rapes and abuse of housemaids; public beatings of drivers and sweepers and, even skilled professionals, by citizens are commonplace. The exploitation of maids, engineers, children and unskilled workers by the Gulf countries continues and will continue until they are able to unite and ask for rights. Bahrain is seeing some <a href="http://www.chanadbahraini.blogspot.com/">signs</a> of such activity. </p>
<p>In trolling around for information on the current popularity of the sport, I happened across this gem of a <a href="http://camelphotos.com/racing_camels.html">website</a> ["... Instead, check out the beauty of these  magnificent camels running at full speed". indeed.]. There is a camel race in <a href="http://www.allcamels.com/camelraces.html">Nevada</a>, natch. </p>
<p><b>update:</b> Mental Mayhem, a Doha blog I usually enjoy, has a <a href="http://www.mentalmayhem.net/mental_mayhem/2005/04/qatar_camel_rac.html">post</a> about Camel racing that I find almost offensive in its naivete. Perhaps thats a bit harsh. So go see what a Day At the Camel Races looks like.</p>
