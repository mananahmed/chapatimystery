  content: "http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/search.html?p=pucka  This was all I could
    find so far. It can be spelled 'pukka' or 'pukkah.' Basically it means it's highly
    important or an official opsition is permanent. The link says it stems from a
    Hindu word. So, the Chosun articles is saying, \"it is very important to REFRAIN......\"
    \   How Pukkah got to be used in Korean English, I have no idea...."

  content: "[...] Moving over to South Asia, Chapati Mystery has a post that occupies
    the delightful interzone between Indo-English language and Korean middle-aged
    women, quoting from a translated Chosun Ilbo article that uses the word pukkah.
    Growing up in South London it was a long time before I knew that the word pukkah
    was of Hindi origin, so its use in a Korean context doesn&#8217;t seem too out
    there. [...]"

<p>I am a _tad_overwhelmed at the moment. But this weekend, I will post my talk from Madison. And I have some long languishing post on teaching postcolonialism. In the meantime, with no ironic hipsterness, I present a Daily Chosun Link 'o da day: <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200610/200610210001.html">Avoiding the Stigma of Being an 'Ajumma'</a>. The checklist at the bottom helps you identify yourself as a Ajumma or a Lady. One handy tip-off: "In the sauna, should the ajumma let out a fart and people stare at her, she will just leave without saying sorry." I forsee a full-scale comedy routine: <b>You might be a Ajumma if ... </b></p>
<p>Most crucially, I call to your attention, this fragment from that brilliant article: "it is pukkah to refrain ..." !! Anyone else going "!!" with me? Pucka or pukka, meaning <i>solid, true, right, done, ripe</i>, is an old hindi word that made it into EIC english fairly early. The OED has a reference from 1698: "FRYER Acc. E. India & P. 205 The Maund Pucka at Agra is double as much as the Surat Maund". Another reference c. 1776: "Trial of Nundocomar 102/1 Maha Rajah said it was necessary to witness it to make it pukka". </p>
<p>Hobson Jobson gives us a fuller <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:885.hobson">rundown</a>. It notes that the EIC took the word to China: "<i>Dis pukka sing-song makee show / How smart man make mistake, galow</i>" from the Leland, Pidgin English Sing-Song.</p>
<p>Um, anyways. But, Pukka as 'correct' in Korean-English? How did that happen? <s>Apparently, it means something in <a href="http://vdict.com/i/1/pukkah.html">Vietnamese</a>. And in Russian it means <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/muller/NT000F3A1E">Wall of Partition</a>? </s>What is this un-pukkah biz? Etymologists want to know. </p>
