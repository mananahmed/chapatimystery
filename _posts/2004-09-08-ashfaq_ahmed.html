  content: My all time fav. has been "Man Chalay Ka Soda". Plan to read it over and
    over again till I get it. The drama made on this book was very moving as well,
    I wonder not many people recall it. Unfortunately, the man who brought this legacy
    stays no more with us. We'll all miss him. May his soul rest in peace (Amen)

  content: I was always enligthened by Ashfaq Ahmed's PTV Forum 'Zawiya' and for me
    his greatest explanation ever was, when he defined the difference between a Muslim
    and a Momin, ' Muslim Wo Jo Allah Ko Maan Kay Chalay' aur 'Momin Wo Jo Allah KI
    Maan Kay Chalay' ... Inna-lilla-he-wa-inna-elaihe-rajioun...May Allah grant him
    Jannah and give patience to his family.AMEN

    It was a great loss to urdu literature. I must say that a big pillar of urdu litrature has fallen. Most of the people admire his drama `man chalay ka soda&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&cent;. But I was very young by that time to understand the difference between spiritualism and materialism.
    But when I saw his program of &Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&cent;zaviya`, it changed my mind and gave me a new concept of the relationship between man and ALLAH.
    last year, I went to lahore to meet him. I called him and requested him to give some time.
    but he had to go somewhere else. Then i insisted him to talk on telephone for sometime.
    he did so, he was so kind and humble that i could&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&cent;nt believe.
    May ALLAH rest his soul in peace.

    A great novelist, playwright and intellectual no doubt, however...

    He was Qudratullah Shahab's bosom buddy, and a part of Shahab's Writers' Guild, whose first session was inaugurated by our wonderful Field Marshal...

    As the editorial in Dawn notes, he was made the editor of Lail-o-Nahar when the Faujis took over the Progressive Papers Limited...

    If this wasn't enough, he was all for Zia's coup and all that went on afterwards in the name of Islam...

    I know the timing isn't great for saying all this, and it isn't nice speaking bad of the dead, especially the recently departed, but this is just an attempt at objectivity, not an attempt to disagree with what you all have said regarding his humility and kindness, not to mention his obvious skills with the pen... after all, if his short essay on Faiz ( the famous "Mala'amati Sufi" one) can appear at the beginning of one of Faiz's books, who am I to condemn him for being on the other side of the fence...

    May his Soul rest in peace, Amen...

    May Allah Almighty rest his soul in peace and betow him a high place in paradise. we both ( me and my wife) used to evervnjoy his wise talk in ZAWIA on TV.Back in 70`s perhaps, I used to listen him on RADIO, in his very popular program: HIYADAT ULLAH TAIN TARAQI NAHEEN KARNI: I was very much enjoyed by people of all age.Indeed, he
    was a great scholar and would be missed by all of us.

    Some people may not like his approach but there is no doubt about his sincerity for Pakistan and nation of Pakistan. Which is currently a very rare thing in our people. May Allah provide us opportunity so we can love our country and our people like him and have the relationship with Allah like his relation with the Creator. Ameen

  content: "\"The Philosophical Anthem of Asfaq Ahmed\"\n  \nAs I heard the News of
    the Death of Asfaq Ahmed on PTV-World at 9:30 Night , I was paralyzed for a short
    movement and I did not remember for how much time I Persistently Saw the TV Screen
    with Stunted eyes. My Tears was floating on my face frequently at that Time and
    I had not much Energy that I would stand on my own feets. And I regretted \n\n
    \        \"Asfaq Ji itni Jal de kia teh\"\n\nThe Millions of Peoples around the
    World Mourns the Death of Asfaq Ahmed.The people who Loves him are in Millions.Asfaq
    Ahmed Appeared to be a Shy, Bold, and and having small eyes on his face often
    fallen down in the keen observation of Contemporary Social Issues.Asfaq ahmed
    was a rare bid in the Classical Conservative Movement Chain of Intellectual that
    appears around 60's.Asfaq's Adherence to his Classic and Traditional Conventions
    and ideas were so deeply rooted that he did not left them and Consistenlty teahes
    them in his distingusih preaching Style. \nIn 1950-51 who can forget these Words
    of great Sadat Hassan Minto\n\nMinto:            \"Asfaq Tu ne Agar \"Gadaria\"
    jese  ik do novel aur lehk deye tu mein tera Hashar Kharab Kar doen Ga\"\n\n Asfaq
    Sayed:     \"Kion Sir kia Bat ho gaye\"\n Minto Sayed:     \" Oe Mera Kia Ho Ga.
    Mein Tu  Urdu ka sab se bara Afsana Nigar Hoon Na\"\nAsfaq sayed:       \"ji Sir
    is mein Kia Shak hai\"\n\nThese Conversation of Minto and Asfaq Ahmed can not
    be glimpse away by the Giant of Urdu Literature.   \n\n\nThe drama of Asfaq Ahmed
    truly characterized the Desire Human instings and Model the super natural influences
    on the human life, that he was destined to be presented.\nHis famous \"BABA\"
    which he had owes as his spiritual Guide was the heart of his total Philosophy.\nThe
    summonization part of the drama really gone down through the veins of viewer \ntells
    that for What Drama Stands for.\nThe Regular Program \"Zawiya\" that he had been
    hosted at PTV for some time was a program with high intellectual and Spiritual
    Fertility. That was also admitted my Jamiludin Aale in his column of sunday 12-9-
    2004 printed in jang edition and above conservation of MINTO,ASFAQ AHMED.\nThe
    Space created with the death his death is hardly to be filled. \nI requested you
    to recite a fateha for the soul of asfaq ahmed."

    he was clear in his mind about the idiology and circumstances of creation of pakistan
    and what muslims of this region paid in return in 1947.he never forgot, and he
    always tried muslims to keep remembering that account.such people are real army
    of pakistan.there are a lot of people in pakistan who think like ashfaq and want
    to live like ashfaq and it will never be easy to defeat them,yes.the body of ashfaq  can
    go behind the scene but his ideas for pakistan's respect and honour would never.

    Asalamu Alikum,
    Well all the brothers and sisters said so much about our Baba Gee that i can not add anything, but i would like to say something. He is the one who awekend my soul and give me the insipiration to find my Real Teacher.This is what , he always talked about. Find your real Baba Gee.
    Once i met with him and he advised me "Manay ka Liya Jana Zoori Nahee".For those who love with his body, he may die .But for those who love with his soul. He is alive and will alive.May be Baba Gee is the one of those people who acted on this Hadis Schrif Of Prohpet Mohammed (PBUH) "Die before you Die".
    May Allah increase his station (Ameen).
    AlFatiha.

    the moment for which i have strived for so long,im going to meet my lord.Ashfaq

    And the Sun Sets.....

    That baba g was a Icon for Pakistan,an Icon of decency and for me he was more like a "Old Tree"....you can sit as long as you wish under the shelter whenever you are tierd--

    i know--we are all going to Miss that shelter surrouded by the fragrance of his words and wisdom"--but i have a strong faith on the Spiritual system laying beneath all the systems on this world.....I believe--Pakistan was and will be safe becuase of the prayers and presence of these Baba's --Baba's that once shown the miracle of "Pakistan"--that made Lahore--"Data ki NAGRI"--Baba's that still pray in front of Allah for the future of pakistan..

    Ashfaq Ahmed---God bless you

    sainthood as Allama Iqbal.\r\n I am not going to change any minds here, but in
    my old age I have figured out that its still useful to let people know that there
    ARE real people from Lahore who dont buy this allama iqbal/ashfaq ahmed/qudratullah
    shahab bullshit. (and yes, Iqbal was a genius and the other two are arranged in
    descending order of IQ , but the magic thread that runs through all three is the
    notion that pretending to believe in magic will make magic happen)...As Hazrat
    Ice Cube (RH) would say \"f--k that shit....\""

    was Qudratullah Shahab&acirc;&euro;&trade;s bosom buddy, and a part of Shahab&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    Writers&acirc;&euro;&trade; Guild, whose first session was inaugurated by our
    wonderful Field Marshal&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\n\r\nAs the editorial in Dawn notes,
    he was made the editor of Lail-o-Nahar when the Faujis took over the Progressive
    Papers Limited&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\n\r\nIf this wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t enough,
    he was all for Zia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s coup and all that went on afterwards in
    the name of Islam&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\n\r\nI know the timing isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    great for saying all this, and it isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t nice speaking bad of
    the dead, especially the recently departed, but this is just an attempt at objectivity,
    not an attempt to disagree with what you all have said regarding his humility
    and kindness, not to mention his obvious skills with the pen&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;
    after all, if his short essay on Faiz ( the famous &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Mala&acirc;&euro;&trade;amati
    Sufi&acirc;&euro;\x9D one) can appear at the beginning of one of Faiz&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    books, who am I to condemn him for being on the other side of the fence&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;\r\n\r\n&acirc;&euro;&oelig;The
    Philosophical Anthem of Asfaq Ahmed&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n\r\nAs I heard the News
    of the Death of Asfaq Ahmed on PTV-World at 9:30 Night , I was paralyzed for a
    short movement and I did not remember for how much time I Persistently Saw the
    TV Screen with Stunted eyes. My Tears was floating on my face frequently at that
    Time and I had not much Energy that I would stand on my own feets. And I regretted
    \r\n\r\n&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Asfaq Ji itni Jal de kia teh&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    Millions of Peoples around the World Mourns the Death of Asfaq Ahmed.The people
    who Loves him are in Millions.Asfaq Ahmed Appeared to be a Shy, Bold, and and
    having small eyes on his face often fallen down in the keen observation of Contemporary
    Social Issues.Asfaq ahmed was a rare bid in the Classical Conservative Movement
    Chain of Intellectual that appears around 60&acirc;&euro;&sup2;s.Asfaq&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    Adherence to his Classic and Traditional Conventions and ideas were so deeply
    rooted that he did not left them and Consistenlty teahes them in his distingusih
    preaching Style.\r\nIn 1950-51 who can forget these Words of great Sadat Hassan
    Minto\r\n\r\nMinto: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Asfaq Tu ne Agar &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Gadaria&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    jese ik do novel aur lehk deye tu mein tera Hashar Kharab Kar doen Ga&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n\r\nAsfaq
    Sayed: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Kion Sir kia Bat ho gaye&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\nMinto
    Sayed: &acirc;&euro;\x9D Oe Mera Kia Ho Ga. Mein Tu Urdu ka sab se bara Afsana
    Nigar Hoon Na&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\nAsfaq sayed: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;ji Sir is mein
    Kia Shak hai&acirc;&euro;\x9D\r\n\r\nThese Conversation of Minto and Asfaq Ahmed
    can not be glimpse away by the Giant of Urdu Literature. \r\n\r\nThe drama of
    Asfaq Ahmed truly characterized the Desire Human instings and Model the super
    natural influences on the human life, that he was destined to be presented.\r\nHis
    famous &acirc;&euro;&oelig;BABA&acirc;&euro;\x9D which he had owes as his spiritual
    Guide was the heart of his total Philosophy.\r\nThe summonization part of the
    drama really gone down through the veins of viewer\r\ntells that for What Drama
    Stands for.\r\nThe Regular Program &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zawiya&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    that he had been hosted at PTV for some time was a program with high intellectual
    and Spiritual Fertility. That was also admitted my Jamiludin Aale in his column
    of sunday 12-9- 2004 printed in jang edition and above conservation of MINTO,ASFAQ
    AHMED.\r\nThe Space created with the death his death is hardly to be filled.\r\nI
    requested you to recite a fateha for the soul of asfaq ahmed."

<p><img src="/images/ashfaqahmed.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>It is with great sadness that I learned that a great Urdu dramatist, novelist and intellectual, Ashfaq Ahmed has passed away. I always thought of him and his wife, Banu Qudsia, as the gentle, wise uncle and aunt of Urdu. I met him on a few occasions and remember, with great fondness, his kindness.<br />
I used his short story <i>Gadaria</i> [The Shepherd] in my class this spring and it got an amazing reaction from all the students. It is the story of Pundit Chintaram, a scholar of Persian and Arabic, who tutors an affluent son of a Muslim. When the riots break out, and the Pundit is surrounded by a screaming mob demanding that he recite the <i>kalimah</i>, he simply asks: <i>Which one?</i> In that tale of people crossing political, cultural and religious boundaries, that sentence stayed with me for a long time. A mohajir himself, Ashfaq Ahmed arrived at Walton Camp along with a million other refugees and made Lahore his home. Partition and the horrors done in the name of religion and state were mainstays in his literature. He gained his popularity from his teleplays, <i>Eik Muhabbat Sau Afsanay</i> and <i>Tota Kahani</i> on PTV. </p>
<p>You can read a better obit <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2004/09/08/top10.htm">here</a>. My thoughts and prayers go with his family.</p>
