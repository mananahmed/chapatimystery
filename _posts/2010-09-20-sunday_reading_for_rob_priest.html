  content: I like how angry it makes Fehrman that some authors aren't fixated enough
    on their own importance and thus don't fetishize their possessions.

  content: Thanks sepoy -- thus far I've only read the Basharat Peer piece on Kashmir,
    which is heartbreaking, but the re-appearance of this site feature is very welcome.

<p><img src="/images/sunday.jpg" align="left"/>It has been a while since the Sunday reading was last done and I actually didn't even manage to do my sunday readings until early monday morning. Yet, here we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"He set it for 7.00. That was 7am on this thing. For 7pm, what he wanted, it should have been 19.00." Lorraine Adams and Ayesha Nair's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/19/times-square-bomber">Inside the mind of the Times Square bomber</a> is an absolute must-read. It originally appeared in the <a href="http://www.granta.com/Magazine/112">Granta: Pakistan</a> issue.
<li>"In 1891, Gauguin headed to the south Pacific to escape &acirc;&euro;&oelig;everything that is artificial and conventional&acirc;&euro;, though his impression of Tahiti as an endless, guilt-free erotic idyll was gleaned principally from the works of the then massively popular Romantic novelist Pierre Loti." I once wrote a thesis on Gauguin, who is getting the full-treatment <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/8008715/Paul-Gauguin-at-the-Tate-Modern-desire-death-myth.html">at the Tate Modern</a>. Good times. On Pierre Loti, see <a href="http://www.glbtq.com/literature/loti_p.html">this</a>.
<li>"The dead speak in Kashmir, often more forcefully than the living." Basharat Peer's <a href="http://www.granta.com/Magazine/112/Kashmirs-Forever-War">Kashmir&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Forever War</a>, also in Granta is a must-must-must read.
<li>"Ngai, a union organizer turned historian, has chosen to write what she calls a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;middle-class&acirc;&euro; history": <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Tepper-t.html?ref=books">review</a> of Mai Ngai's <em>The Lucky Ones: One Family and the Extraordinary Invention of Chinese America</em>, NYT, September 17, 2010.
<li>"When I die, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s when I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be famous": L<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/09/19/lost_libraries/?page=full">ost libraries: The strange afterlife of authors&acirc;&euro;&trade; book collections</a> by Craig Fehrman, September 19, 2010.
<li>"I should state up front that I am not a fan of programme fiction. Basically, I feel about it as towards new fiction from a developing nation with no literary tradition: I recognise that it has anthropological interest, and is compelling to those whose experience it describes, but I probably wouldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t read it for fun. Moreover, if I wanted to read literature from the developing world, I would go ahead and read literature from the developing world. At least that way I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d learn something about some less privileged culture &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; about a less privileged culture that some people were actually born into, as opposed to one that they opted into by enrolling in an MFA programme." Elif Batuman, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree">Get a Real Degree</a>, LRB, 23 September 2010. The one Iowa MFA/English PhD I know has not issued a public comment, so far, but Aaron has <a href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/09/16/programme/">a nice round-up</a> of responses.
<li>"In any case, names you should know": <a href="http://arablit.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/a-primer-on-saudi-lit-abdulrahman-munif-to-present/">A Primer on Saudi Lit, Abdulrahman Munif to Present</a>, M. Lynx Qualey, 19 September, 2010.
