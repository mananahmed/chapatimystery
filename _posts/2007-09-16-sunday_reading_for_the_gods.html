  content: "20/20 is an affront to cricket.  Actually despite being a child of the
    ODI age I must say it never managed to equal test cricket for me, though the good
    thing about post-ODI test matches was that so many more of them had results....  It
    isn't about nostalgia, it's also about the fact that prodigies like Muhammad Asif
    notwithstanding, there isn't much for the bowler to do in most ODIs today, and
    it's embarrassing to see bowlers in the 20/20s."

    Glad that's settled.  But still, Twenty20 is perfect entertainment and I
    love it to bits. And Pakistan just beat the Aussies to go through to the Quarter
    finals! (I also love free live TV streaming through the internet...)"

  content: "Re His toughness problem ..... and ours  'Podhoretz points out that
    religious terrorism is less the result of poverty than of political oppression.
    As long as millions of Muslims are ruled by dictators, terrorism will grow apace.
    The neocon strategy, adopted by the US administration, is to \"drain the swamps,\"
    to get rid of terrorism by democratizing the Middle East.'  I think it would
    be pertinent to re-visit this essay by Eqbal Ahamd  Terrorism: Theirs and
    Ours  By Eqbal Ahmad (A Presentation at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
    October 12, 1998)  http://www.sangam.org/ANALYSIS/Ahmad.htm"

    inference regarding Christian specificity and the limits of the lessons of the
    Enlightenment. Contemporary Japan and India, among other non-Christian countries,
    have also embraced the Great Separation. It's not so clear
    that the Christian West is exceptional in anything except for first proposing
    the answer that has gradually gained momentum almost everywhere except in the
    Islamic Middle East.' um, yeah"

  content: "\"&ldquo;The only way to discourage Islamist extremism in
    Pakistan in the long run is through democracy.&rdquo; Hey, Economist,
    they didn't listen to me, why would they listen to you?\"  Sepoy,
    where have you been? Besides the Economist, EVERYONE knows that democracy will
    counteract extremism [close sarcasm tags].  Let me explain my snark: I was
    told by a well known figure in Pakistani politics(who shall remain unnamed)that
    everyone in the US- both in political and mass media circles- knows that Mush
    needs to go and there needs to be democracy. According to this person, there's
    no doubt in anyone's mind in the US that democracy will counteract extremism.
    Apparently, John Edwards was just joshing with us when the NYT quoted him as saying
    that you can't let democracy reign in Pakistan because of all the fundies.  Then,
    this person told me off about how I don't know what I'm talking about when I brought
    up a series of NYT articles which argue (or insinuated) that democracy is just
    not fit for some countries like Pakistan, and then said person hung up on me."

    Still bored with it?  Please gods let it not end in another bowl out though."

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>The <a href="http://worldtwenty20.yahoo.com/">ICC World Twenty20</a> is currently underway in South Africa. It is exciting and exhilarating and droves of fans are watching this most amazing and necessary rejuvenating elixir pumped into the staid, old, decrepit body of Cricket. Or so they tell me. I really cannot be bothered. Apparently the India-Pakistan match ended in a tie which is resolved with a "bowl-out". A bowl-out. India won the match "3-0". &Euml;&circ;d&Eacute;&trade;b&Eacute;&trade;l&Euml;&OElig;yo&Aring;¬ç. t&Auml;&ldquo;. ef. </p>
<p>A lot of my cricket playing happened in the short-form [25 overs a side] and we never had a bowl-out. A bowl-out sounds like some type of TV-producer inspired madness - oh wait, the ICC rules clearly state that "the host television broadcaster shall be consulted as to which end of the ground the bowlers should bowl from". Ye Gods. Bring on the <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/ap/20070913/img/psp-south-africa-cricket-tw-4bdafb1bf01c0.html">cheerleaders</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, I will like to read and review Lilla's <i>The Still-Born God</i>. Until then, you can see what NYT's Goldstein <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Goldstein-t.html?ex=1347595200&amp;en=b7b493c9a7b83803&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss"> thinks</a> of it. Judging from the excerpt, I am disinclined to take kindly to Lilla's claim of exceptionalism - in regards to both the American experience of God and politics and the Islamic world in general.
<li>Another review worth reading is Megan Marshall's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Marshall-t.html?ex=1347595200&en=ede433396f95f89b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">A Life Less Ordinary</a> on Linda Colley's <i>The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh: A Woman in World History</i>: &ldquo;The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh&rdquo; is a dazzling performance of historical scholarship that reveals just enough of what Colley describes in her acknowledgments as &ldquo;the ordeal of tracking Elizabeth Marsh&rdquo; to allow readers the sense that they too are on the trail of this compulsively itinerant woman."
<li>Ian Buruma, in the NYRB, reviews the papa neocon's latest, "<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20590;>His Toughness Problem&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and Ours</a>: "The key to Podhoretz's politics seems to me to lie right there: the longing for power, for toughness, for the Shtarker who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything, and hatred of the contemptible, cowardly liberals with their pandering ways and their double standards. Since Podhoretz, himself a bookish man, can never be a Shtarker, his government must fill that role, and not give a damn about anyone or anything. And not only the US government, but Israel too." Can I get a <i>Oy vey</i>, <i>subhan allah</i>, or <i>Daggum it</i>?
<li>"The only way to discourage Islamist extremism in Pakistan in the long run is through democracy." Hey, Economist, they didn't listen to <a href="/archives/homistan/the_mosque_and_the_ballot.html">me</a>, why would they listen to <a href="http://economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9804075">you</a>?
<li>Sanjay Subrahmanyam is in the LRB, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n18/subr01_.html">reviewing</a> a couple of recent books that look delightfully snark-worthy. I don't know what he says, because I don't have a subscription. If anyone does, do send me a pdf. And if you do, also send me the essay done by Bernard Porter a few weeks back in the LRB. Good deal? Also in LRB is Perry Anderson's <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n18/ande01_.html">Depicting Europe</a> - which you can, and should, read.
<li>Any CM readers want to do a book club on David Leavitt's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Freudenberger-t.html?ex=1347595200&amp;en=8d8278c72cdbe6a5&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">The Indian Clerk</a>? Maybe Bloomsbury USA can throw a couple of review copies our way? eh?
<li>Chicago has played host to the annual ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) forever but I have never attended. But after reading Samaha's accounts - I especially recommend <a href="http://samaha.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/isna-invasion-of-the-isna-deaniacs/">Invasion of the ISNA Deaniacs</a> - maybe, I should have gone this year.
<li>And finally, Bill O'Reilly is making <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/opinion/maybe_we_should_try_coddling">sense of it all</a>.
</ul>
