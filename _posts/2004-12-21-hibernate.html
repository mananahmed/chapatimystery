    hullo, sepoy,
    stumbled onto your blog, and love how its done. Actually, I'm speaking here on a mission. I'm one of the administration people for this space called www.desimediabitch.blogspot.com. We are a space for venting opinion/ criticism/ observation/ ideas/ bitchiness at the Indian media. (yea, am Indian). As a holiday season initiative, we wanted to invite some Pakistani bloggers to come and post on our space as well - how you view the Paktani media, and all your opinions/... etc on the same! The Pak Spl is on from Dec 25 to Dec 5, during which the desis will sit back and allow our guests to post - and we shall indulge in our observations and ideas.

    Would love it if you could join in and post some.

    So, PLEASE - do check out the space, and get back to me via email if u are interested! My personal blogspace is www.livinghigh.blogspot.com.

    Hope to hear from u soon, buddy.
