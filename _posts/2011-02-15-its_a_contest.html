<p>Chapati Mystery is launching a new flash fiction contest, which might just happen one time or might become an OVERNIGHT SENSATION or even a TRADITION. For the first contest, we solicit entries inspired by the following tweet sent out by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/polgrim">@polgrim</a> on the occasion of Hosni Mubarak's removal from the office of President of Egypt:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was deep in conversation with an ambassador's wife of an 'x' country over dinner when I get a text from Paris to tell me Egypt is free.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, @polgrim added that 'x' country was Scandinavian. INTRIGUING. Entries should be between 100 and 200 words long and should be pasted into an email to lapatastic at gmail dot com. Our special CELEBRITY judge will be the acclaimed flash fiction writer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insects-Just-Like-Except-Wings/dp/8190605631/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1297797776&sr=1-1">KUZHALI MANICKAVEL</a>. Deadline? February 28th, 2011, MIDNIGHT GMT. The top three winners will have their stories published on Chapati Mystery (!!) and receive a FREE copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Degree-Charu-Nivedita/dp/8190605615"><em>Zero Degree</em></a> by Charu Nivedita to be mailed ANYWHERE in the world.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lapata</p>
<p><em>Update!</p>
<p>Deadline has been extended to March 15th, 2011!!</em><strong></p>
