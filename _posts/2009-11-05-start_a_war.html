  content: I just read your article.Great analysis.I  have also read your piece in
    the Nation. Very well written and informative. I wish that people like you who
    are real experts write more on Pakistan than the multitude of experts on CNN,
    PBS and FOX opining on the issue. I look forward to more of your articles.

  content: "Waziristan was necessary as a counter-insurgency. I don't think the
    war will/should be extended into Balochistan. If the Waziristan militants are
    crushed then the counter-insurgency against Islamist types will be over. Then,
    in relation to the TTP types and their fellow travellers, the fight will switch
    to counter-terrorism. That doesn't/won't involve the army. That'll be intelligence/police.  Look
    at how they killed out the Swat Taliban support base Operation Clean Up style
    over the last four months after securing Swat.  I also think that the Centre/Provinces
    problem will get resolved over time as more election cycles are gone through.
    As an example look at the nineties, where the only antagonism province wise, was
    with a sub-section of a province, i.e, Karachi; and that too a festering sore
    left by the last military regime of Zia Ul Haq.  If you haven't noticed,
    every military regime, after its end, leaves behind some part of the country in
    internal revolt and an army operation ensues, which results in either defeat for
    the forces, or some sort combination of killing killers and a subconsciously understood
    political negotiation with the surviving political (moderate?) faction.  Ayub
    Khan/Yahya Khan: East Pakistan  Zia-ul-Haq: Urban Sindh  Pervez Musharraf:
    F.A.T.A and Gas producing Balochistan"

  content: "I think the next \"war\" if you want to call it, will be extra-judicial
    killing by police/intelligence operatives in Punjab, NWFP, and reconquered South
    Waziristan.  Here is 5 Rupees Blog quoting Owen Bennett Jones:  <i>The
    battle-lines between the Sunni sectarian groups and the government were now drawn
    and throughout 1999 there were thirty-six extra judicial killings of activists
    from the SSP [Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan] and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The police were
    told that anyone who managed to kill Basra [Riaz Basra, head of LeJ] would be
    given a 5 million-rupee reward.</i>   Lets not kid ourselves; if Pakistanis
    do this, well, its only be par for the Pakistani course.  And it will end
    them the way it shaved down the militants of the MQM and the pre-9/11 Sipah-e-Sahaba."

  content: "Sepoy, this is an excellent piece.  In particular, I can only commend
    the lucidity of the following excerpts:  \"What is clear, however, is that
    the army campaign ... forced some three million civilians to flee.\"  Three. MILLION.
    \ I have previously (on CM) drawn the analogy with the Great Lakes crises, and
    this sort of figure simply makes that comparison a lot more plausible.  And, not
    to downplay any group's suffering, but three million in a relatively (by sub-continental
    standards) sparsely populated area is an even larger number than it seems.  &amp; \"The
    true crisis facing Pakistan is not the Taliban: it is the rupture between the
    federal state and its constituent parts, and Islamabad's refusal
    to accede to the legitimate needs and demands of its citizens in places like Swat
    and Baluchistan. It is a rupture, indeed, that is written into the very fabric
    of the state, and the reason why Bangladesh seceded from West Pakistan in 1971,
    after it was denied political legitimacy by the military regime and then brutalised
    by an oppressive army operation aimed at quashing any opposition.\"  Aside:
    a quibble: did you write the byline or is that from The National?"

  content: "About Sepoy's article; I am sorry, but I believe at a certain point war
    is called for. And when the TNSM broke the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation agreement back
    in April 2009; it was implicit that attacking them meant eventually going after
    South Waziristan. The broken treaty justified the use of full power against the
    militants in Swat, and their spiritual leaders in Waziristan.  There are
    times when you need to forget the wonderful liberal ideas you are taught at school.
    I disagree with your pacifism in this case. And my sympathy is not exactly brimming
    for the Swati's who revolted for \"Sharia\" in 1994, 1998 and again in 2007.  They
    were the ideological idiots who bought this down on the head of all the Pakistani
    militants. If the population suffered collectively; well now the TNSM men are
    turning up as corpses around the neighbouroods they use to terrorise.  Success
    is not pretty; but unlike failure it leaves your lungs breathing."

  content: "I just wrote this comment on registan.net and it has some tangential connection
    to this piece. (the comment was in response to the asia times story that the US
    is going to get out and is asking the Pak army to help them get a face saving
    deal with the taliban):  Here is my theory of the day (why not?): The Pakistani
    army high command is about to make another one of their periodic strategic miscalculations.
    These miscalculations usually arise when senior generals feed psyops to pet journalists,
    then read them in the paper the next day and start getting excited and then meet
    over dinner to discuss the latest breaking news and cannot believe how EVERYTHING
    is proceeding as they predicted.  The US may or may not be about to &ldquo;cut
    and run&rdquo;, but irrespective of that, the days of &ldquo;pre-eminent
    Pakistani interests in afghanistan&rdquo; are not coming back (though
    its clear that GHQ believes they are; Ejaz Haider had a piece about this in the
    latest Friday Times in which he manages to write the following sentence: let it
    be said that modalities aside they need to sit down and work out a joint strategy
    that underwrites and accepts Pakistan's pre-eminent role in
    Afghanistan and Islamabad's security concerns&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;.).
    The news from Aabpara is that the ISI's brilliant strategy
    has been vindicated. The US is about to pull out (the next midterm elections are
    said to have a crucial role in all this) and needs the ISI to help them avoid
    a humiliating takeoff from the embassy roof. More money is on its way. India will
    be pressurised to compromise on Kashmir, money will flow into GHQ, China will
    &ldquo;invest in mega projects&rdquo;, good jihadis will
    blow up Indian railway stations and bad jihadis will die of small pox. all will
    be well.  I am afraid I find the whole picture overly optimistic. I dont
    think Obama is leaving in 12 months. I dont think the US can make a deal with
    the good taliban even if it wants to. I dont think India is going to give up anything
    substantive. And I dont think the war against the bad taliban will end anytime
    soon. The army will continue to enjoy a pre-eminent position in Pakistani politics
    for a while and will keep getting paid by the US for various operations, but there
    is no pot of gold (vast mineral reserves, pipelines, Chinese bearing insanely
    expensive gifts) at the end of the rainbow. Its going to be more of the same&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;."

  content: "Re: \"Big bureaucracy and big military has kept Pakistan alive over the
    past half century. The &ldquo;playbook&rdquo; is effective...\"  Something
    has certainly been kept alive; but the question is what has been kept alive, who
    is it benefiting, and if the it's all been worth it?  (The questions are not Pakistan-specific,
    one might pose them in a number of different contexts).  It's a bit circular to
    say that the \"big bureaucracy and big military\" structure that seems to exist
    primarily to benefit a status quo where \"big bureaucracy and big military\" are
    two pillars, is some kind of achievement -- a bit like saying that Dev Anand's
    continuing achievement is to produce and direct films he stars in."

  content: "Stop picking on Dev Anand.  Obviously, GHQ has helped GHQ stay in power.
    But GHQ is not the karma of the Raj, its a mutation (the British Indian army was
    remarkably non-political). What I meant by karma of the raj was the whole apparatus
    of thanedars and AC and DC and whatnot that actually runs the country (to whatever
    extent its run by anyone).   GHQ actually uses the same apparatus (and constantly
    undermines and abuses it, one reason its gotten weaker with time). Contrary to
    what some foreign observers seem to believe, the army is NOT the most effective
    institution in the country. in fact, it is remarkably clueless about the details
    of administration. It USES the decaying remains of British Raj to rule the country.
    The army took over WAPDA (the electricity monopoly) and made a hash of it. They
    set up their own airline and made a hash of it. They get appointed to various
    high positions (and make a hash of it more often than not) but the nuts and bolts
    are still the remnants of the Raj..."
