  content: "\"The tension between knowing India through what is &ldquo;written&rdquo;
    about it in the metropole and what can be &ldquo;experienced&rdquo;
    from India itself, persists.\"  I'm not sure how India differs from any
    other place in this regard. Many people talk about how much they know about a
    society or a culture, whether its the Confucian, Islamic, or European countries,
    without actually having lived or visited any of those places.  That said,
    I certainly understand that colonialism has been a powerful, negative force in
    creating perceptions about India. But I also think that its important to distinguish
    between colonialist attitudes and xenophobic attitudes. Both are negative and,
    well, evil, but I think the later is slightly forgivable while the former is not
    in any way.  I think the fact that a lot of the scholarship we've inherited
    was from colonialists is the problem, more so than the fact that some scholars
    talk about Indian society without ever visiting or learning an Indian language.
    I mean, who would take such a person seriously?"

  content: "Okay. Just to keep up my record of contrariety here, I'll bite. James
    Mill was a great historian of India, the most important if not the only of the
    early British historians of India, and he was absolutely correct to claim, as
    Sepoy puts it, that \"a certain character, a certain training, and a certain location
    were necessary to write a history of India (him, his, Europe) and not the mundane
    details of first-hand experience.\" Writing history is not and could never be
    a matter of \"experience.\" Moreover, what was far more important that knowledge
    of Indian languages or experience of India, which, of course, everybody living
    in India at the time had, was precisely what Mill brought to the task - modern
    thought. The distinctiveness of the bourgeois perspective (which we all share)
    and which \"the europeans\" brought to India meant that entire dimensions of Indian
    society become visible in historical documents which were never visible before,
    not in millennia of documents written in Sanskrit (a language I know), nor, indeed,
    in any documents produced in other language. This is not because of the native
    genius of europeans, but because it is only modern bourgeois subjects to whom
    \"society\" (and, therefore, \"history\") appears as an object.   Mill was
    a radical egalitarian and universalist and this is evident throughout his History.
    He was not a racist and his ideas about the relative backwardness of India in
    his day was motivated by a conceptual framework which is by no means foreign to
    us today (but is rather institutionalized in myriad ways) and one that would apply
    no differently to other areas of Europe as well as the past of his own society.
    It was a backwardness that every Indian monarch opposed to the Company recognized
    when they hired european mercenary officers and imitated the Company's state practices
    for the administration of their domains (and there were none who didn't do these
    things). All subsequent historians are heirs to Mill.   Mill's History is
    also extremely valuable for its seering criticisms of the illiberalism of the
    East India Company's own policies and past in the subcontinent. It took Macaulay's
    review of the book to begin the process of whitewashing that past, though writers
    like Marx (another who didn't know Indian languages, but whose writings on India
    remain extremely valuable) did preserve the memory of the British working class's
    struggle against the East India Company's monopoly privilege, its role in propping
    up the British oligarchy, and its role in underdeveloping the Indian economy,
    and its stifling of the development of commercial (and other) relations between
    Europe and India."

  content: Personally, I don't see the sepoy and Spencer L. posts as contrary so much
    as complementary.  Mill's importance, his significance, is undeniable, as is his
    abiding relevance, given how "we" are enframed by the same paradigm (i.e. inasmuch
    as we too are modern bourgeois subjects to whom history appears as an object that
    may be studied) -- that is precisely why the assumptions and attitudes implicit
    and explicit in his work ought to be critically examined (and any naive notion
    that one can liberate oneself "out of" the paradigm by such critique).

  content: "Generally speaking; I think Mill's history is a pretty poor piece of work.
    Most economic historians will now tell you that he was speaking absolute crap
    about the state of the economy and standards of living during the period of the
    EIC ascendancy. Like most writers of the period he remained deeply ignorant about
    a lot of aspects what was going on in South Asia. Ok, yeah, he critiqued the EIC
    policies and identified certain 'illiberal' trends in Indian society at the time.
    That isn't much to justify wading through several volumes of boring, essentially
    repetitive prose. The earlier parts of his history, are just laughable in the
    crude simplifications of Hindu society they contain.  Personally I prefer
    the work of people who actually did travel and live in India; though they had
    their own problems, like Bernier.   <i>There's an
    excellent discussion of Mill's history in Nicholas Dirks'
    Castes of Mind (one of my very favorite books on Indian history)&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;</i>  Q,
    if you liked Dirks' book check out Declan Quigley's Interpretation of Caste; I
    think it is much more rigorous and comprehensive than Dirks' work and correctly
    identifies the different appoaches to understanding caste as a system. It essentially
    prefigures the neo-Hocartian view that Dirks' puts forward."

    Mill has a quite refined early 19th century style. As a history, of course it's
    dated. It's a bit churlish to criticize the book for that, don't you think? After
    all, the book was published over 190 years ago. One thing I would point out
    is that Mill had access to sources the likes of which we can only envy, i.e. extended

  content: "<i>I'd like to know who these economic historians of

    mind is David Washbrook who was my supervisor at MPhil level. Sanjay Subrahmanyam,
    Tirthankar Roy, Muzzafar Alam, Om Prakash are all great reads and authorities
    in this period.  <i>As for boring repetitive prose, do you feel the same

    any historian studying this period what they think of these histories; sure they
    have some historiographical value but to claim that any of these wrote &ldquo;great
    histories&rdquo; of their period is bit of stretch imo. I liked Gibbon,
    but his approach to his subject, though trashed by modern scholars of the period;
    is infinitely more sophisticated and nuanced than Mills. I think you need to re-examine
    them both if you can even mention them in the same breath. I am unfamiliar with
    the other works but I am not a fan of 17th-19th century writing on the whole.  <i>After

    am just pointing out why I don't think it was a &ldquo;great
    piece of history&rdquo; so this point is kind of obvious. It isn't
    that there wasn't other writing at the time which I preferred
    — I gave Bernier's works on India as an
    example.  <i>One thing I would point out is that Mill had access to sources

    lived in India for a few years at most before returning to speak to Mills. Not
    necessarily the best source to write a good history of India; a good source  to
    write a history of what a Englishman thinks was the history of India."

  content: "Neither Subrahmanyam nor Washbrook are really authorities on the 18th
    century. Neither is Tirthankar Roy for that matter. As for Om Prakash, I would
    scarcely call any of his book \"a great read\".  Certainly, he does great things
    with the Dutch archive, but the work's a bit dry. As for Muzaffar, his writing
    is important, of course, but  (though most people skip this part of the story)
    he very largely confirms the broad story of decline in 18th century North India,
    for instance in and around Delhi itself and in the Punjab. The economically dynamic
    \ regions he identifies are Awadh and Bihar. To the extent that this seriously
    alters James Mill's views (after all, Mill perfectly well that India had had a
    considerable manufacturing base in the 18th century), I expect he would gladly
    accept Muzaffar's findings, since he and Muzaffar (and this is the crucial point)
    share the same basic protocols of what constitutes \"proof\" in historical inquiry.
    \   Of course, someone who has lived and done business in India in the 18th
    century would be a great source if writing the history of that period (Mill's
    is chiefly concerned with what was for him the most recent period). As any practicing
    historian of the period (such as myself) can tell you, there are innumerable things
    that such a person would know which we will never be able to learn, because our
    documentary evidence is so impoverished. Information about tools, habits, production
    processes, building styles, everyday technologies of all kinds, etc., etc. is
    lacking because of the narrowness of the interests of those who produced the archive.
    Much of the most critical knowledge that we have of peasant production processes,
    property forms, folklore, religion, and habits comes from the important surveys
    and local histories written precisely by the Englishmen (or, rather, Britons)
    you affect to despise. For instance, there is no one who writes seriously on 18th
    century Bengal and Bihar who would ignore the meticulous survey reports of Buchanan-Hamilton.
    For those with a real interest in the everyday lives of the working people of
    that region of India, such european sources shed more light than any documents
    we have from an earlier time."

---
<p>In 1806, James Mill (1773—1836) - father of John Stuart Mill - began writing his monumental <i>History of British India</i>. It was finally published in 1817, in 3 vols, and he claimed, in his preface, that it was the first such comprehensive history to have dealt with India. The preface of this history is one of my favorite documents. </p>
<p>Mill sets out to write a <i>critical</i> history of India since the "knowledge of India" was sorely lacking in both the general public and those whose job it was to <i>know</i> India. Mill correctly identifies the one big objection which would be raised against him: "This writer, it will be said, has never been in India; and, if he has any, has a very slight, and elementary acquaintance, with any of the languages of the East." (( James Mill. Preface to <i>The History of British India</i>. i-xxxvi. (London: James Madden And Co., 1840), xviii )) That shouldn't matter, Mill asserts, since the Company never requires from the men who are sent to <i>govern</i> India that they know any languages or have prior experience. Why such requirement, then, for a historian? Furthermore, Mill argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the most successful attempts in history had been made, with out ocular knowledge of the country, or acquaintance with its languages. Robertson, for example, never beheld America, though he composed its history. He never was in either Germany or Spain, yet he wrote the history of Charles the Fifth. Of Germany he knew not so much as the language; and it was necessary for him to learn that of Spain, only because the documents which it yielded were not translated into any of the languages with which he was acquainted. Tacitus, though he never was in Germany, and was certainly not acquainted with the language of our uncultivated ancestors, wrote the exquisite account of the manners of Germans. ((<i>ibid.,</i> xix.)) </p></blockquote>
<p>Mill grants that there is some utility in "seeing" India, perhaps, even in "speaking" India but all that still remains the purview of a single individual and his limited life-experience. To write a proper history of India, the task must encompass many such lives and many such experiences, combined with that needed faculty to think, to analyze, and to judge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever is worth seeing or hearing in India, can be expressed in writing. As soon as every thing of importance is expressed in writing, a man who is duly qualified may obtain more knowledge of India in one year in his closet in England, than he could obtain during the course of the longest life, by the use of his eyes and ears in India. ((<i>ibid.,</i> xxii.))</p></blockquote>
<p>To Mill, a certain character, a certain training, and a certain location were necessary to write a history of India (him, his, Europe) and not the mundane details of first-hand experience. His "critical" history and his formulation of "historian the judge" did not need to interrogate the archive itself - it was, after all, produced by fine servants of the Company. He didn't need the local language, because the knowledge in them was untrustworthy - it needed to undergo the act of "translation" so that truth could rise. (( Lewis Smith writes in the introduction to his translation of <i>Qissa Chahar Derwish</i>: "Clive never knew the languages of India. When asked why he never learnt it, he replied `Why, if I had, I should not have conquered India; the black knaves would have led me astray by their cunning advice; but as I never understood them, I was never misled by them'. ))</p>
<p>Mill's history drew favorable reviews. </p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Mill has proved by incontrovertible evidence, that the Hindus, though superior to the savage tribes of America and Africa, are far removed from the civilization of modern Europe, or even of Europe as it existed in the middle ages; that they should be ranked on nearly the same level with the Chal-dagans, the Assyrians, and the Egyptians of antiquity; that they are not superior to the present inhabitants of Bootan, China, Cochin-China, Siam, or Pegu; and that there never was a time when they were more highly civilized than they are to-day. ((<i>The British Review, and London Critical Journal</i>, Vol. XII, 1818.))</p></blockquote>
<p>The tension between knowing India through what is "written" about it in the metropole and what can be "experienced" from India itself, persists.</p>
