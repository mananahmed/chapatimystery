<p>Back from Cairo bearing some deep ridges in the psyche, and in the soul. There is so much to say about Cairo and I find myself unable to articulate any of it. It cannot be enough to claim, blithely, that I fell in love with Cairo. That sounds <em>unright</em>. Love has too many spikes on the ECG chart. Too exciting or too distressing. This was the closest I have ever felt to returning home - without having actually arrived home. </p>
<p>Near the end, I contemplated staying. I was told that a marriage to a citizen yields a passport in only 2 years. Also that going undocumented is quite possible. I imagined a business that would sustain me - adding masala to various street foods in Cairo. (they have bhutta without masala!)</p>
<p>Funny that I thought only of alternate careers.</p>
<p>Here are some first shots from Cairo - many more will come. These are<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72157625503242953/with/5273001891/"> exteriors only</a>. </p>
