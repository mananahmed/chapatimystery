    so underwhelmed right now that Paris Hilton's conversation seems like intellectual

    Tayeb Salih's novel Season of Migration to the North has some wonderful lessons
    on undoing Orientalism.

    <strong>Falcons and horses are evil. And so are moons...</strong>

    Sepoy points us to a new weapon in The War on Terror: The Islamic Imagery Project being run out the presitgious United States Military Academy at West Point, which aims to provide analyses for one-hundred key motifs that appear throughout...

    distribute survey questions to detainees in guantanamo bay or something. im imagining
    soldiers questioning a prisoners about the difference between the meaning of a
    white rose and red one.

    i am told there are some amusing infelicities in the arabic phrase guide, too, though i can't verify.  also, gotta love that little social structure diagram, and the who-hates-whom guide to 'cultural groups.'



    the sad thing is, this is actually one of the higher points of 'sensitivity training' WRT to Iraq, from what I hear.

  content: In fairness, if you're trying to give a quick introduction to a culture,
    you are necessarily going to paint in broad strokes.  After all, in a first-year
    Middle Eastern Studies introduction to Islam you're probably going to be a bit
    more general than if you're teaching a course on, say, occasionalism in Al-Ghazali.

  content: Wow, what a trenchant critique! Your taken-out-of-context, cut-and-paste
    hatchet job bespeaks a very high standard of fair-mindedness on your part, and
    your ad hominem demonstration that Ostovar has a sense of humor by quoting from
    his MySpace page is certainly the more devastating half of your two-pronged attack.  Puh-leez.

  content: Apparently Wonko is Ostovar in disguise, or one of his acolytes.  Wonko
    speaks of it as if the project is WAR AND PEACE, when it's more like a mediocre
    cliff notes...So, Wonko, "puh-leez" yourself.

<p><i>The moon is a very important and complex symbol in Islamic culture. </p>
<p>The horse is a very important symbol in both Arabic and Islamic culture.  </p>
<p>There is perhaps no landscape in Islamic culture and tradition more evocative and recognizable than the desert.</p>
<p>Palm trees, particularly date palms, are inextricably linked to Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Islamic culture. </p>
<p>The lion is an important symbol in Islamic culture.</p>
<p>The camel has particular importance to Arab culture.</p>
<p>The horse is a very important symbol in both Arabic and Islamic culture.  </p>
<p>The Falcon is an important symbol in Islamic culture.</p>
<p>Women hold powerful symbolic value in Islamic culture. </p>
<p>There is a lot of symbology surrounding hand gestures in Islamic culture.  </p>
<p>The element of blood is highly symbolic in Islamic culture.</p>
<p>The crescent moon is an important symbol of Islamic identity.</p>
<p>Weapons are symbolically important in Islamic culture.</p>
<p>Martyrs are a source of inspiration in Islamic culture.</p>
<p>The color black is a very significant color in the Islamic tradition. </p>
<p>The element of blood is highly symbolic in Islamic culture.</i></p>
<p>All this and more from the highly acclaimed West Point series, <a href="http://www.ctc.usma.edu/imagery.asp">The Islamic Imagery Project Visual Motifs in Jihadi Internet Propaganda</a> a project which proudly proclaims that "each entry is grounded in a deep reading of Islamic history, culture, language and experience" and that "there is a certain timelessness to these motifs, which reflects the authors's desire to portray their extreme interpretation of Salafi thought as a logical refinement of traditional Islamic thought."</p>
<p>But wait. You ready for the punch line? </p>
<p><b>"To die for one's faith is the most spiritual act in the Islamic tradition."</b> </p>
<p>Well. There you have it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Afshon.jpg"/>Oh. Who, you ask, should we thank for this brilliant analysis? This rendering of the veil? This violation of the inner sanctum of the harem? Why, it is Afshon Ostovar who "wrote the analyses of the individual motifs" and who describes himself thusly: <a href= "http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=22170159">Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...</a> [yes, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/">I know</a> ]</p>
<p>And they say that the experts in "Islamic culture" are not helping in the War on Terror.</p>
