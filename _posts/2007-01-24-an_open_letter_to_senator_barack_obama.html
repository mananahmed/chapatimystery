    Well, it may be disturbing, but it's sound politics.  After all, eventually, the bad guys are going to get through and we're going to have another attack on American soil.  After all, they only have to get lucky once, while the FBI and Homeland Security have to get lucky every time.



    Now then, imagine the aftermath of the attack in a world where Obama had said what you suggest.  Imagine Fox News running the images of an Angry Muslim Mob cut to a Mosque cut to the smoking wreckage of the attack while in the background they play the voice of Obama saying, "There is no direct correlation between a Muslim and a terrorist. "  Imagine them playing such an image as part of their segment on his being a secret Muslim.  It would be bad, bad news, and Obama knows it.

  content: "Andrew,  What is the point of an Obama presidency if he wins on the
    basis of conforming to the establishment or worrying how Fox News will portray
    him? \"You are a Muslim\" has become an allegation, a four letter word in American
    politics and that mental attitude seems to be seeping into our public lives. The
    next thing I know I'm not being considered for a job or 'am being denied entry
    into a restaurant just because my name has a \"Mohammed\" in it. Such behavior
    is racism, pure and simple.  Barrack Obama had a chance to call on this ridiculous
    stereotyping but he chose to play it safe. I agree with  Sepoy, the  Obama campaign
    could have issued a much better worded statement that did not treat the word Muslim
    as a grave insult."

    yeah, i have to go with sepoy and ubaid on this one: his office bungled the situation. rather than taking a stand and calling the echo chamber on their racist bullshit, the office pretty much kept playing along with the status quo and rebuffed this "accusation". just because the political arena is following bullshit rules doesn't mean you have to play by them. letting these jerks frame the discussion and trying to make a point within that framework is what lost the dems everything from '94 onward. (disclaimer: i am of the opinion that the dems won nothing in '06, that the repubs finally screwed the pooch so much for so long that no amount of "&iexcl;taxes, gays, and dead babies!" could save them from a 'throw the bums out' election.) obama is in a position where he doesn't <i>have</i> compromise his ideals and stand up for what's right. even if his possible prez run falls short, he still has a job in the senate, unlike edwards. it's not like illinois would vote him out anytime soon. speaking of which, if obama gets the prez nod, who the hell would IL send in his place?



    sidenote: anybody else get <a href="http://www.donlafontaine.com/" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> as the voice in your head when reading andrew's post?

    Let me add my voice in support of Ubaid's and sepoy's views here.  "Better than" the alternatives is not going to be good enough to enthuse me; a response along the lines suggested in sepoy's open letter would have been "pretty damn good".



    i.e., Andrew R: I don't subscribe to the view that the default condition of the American public is bigotry and that any political strategy must take it as a given.  If it were indeed a given, we wouldn't have parties and campaign committees spending quite so much on spin doctors, manipulation, etc.  The public is "in play", and if we don't recognize that we have already lost (Exhibit A for "already lost": Hillary Clinton, whether or not she wins the election).



    One might still lose anyway, but as the character played by philosopher/actor Akshay Kumar responded (to a suggestion that he give up as persisting in the mission with his honest cop-boss), in Khakee (simply one of the best masala Hindi movies in over a decade, for ye unfortunates who haven't seen it): "Main aap ke peeche peeche aaonga; aakhri waqt tak aaonga; lekin aaonga zaroor" :-)

    Sepoy, you are spot on with respect to Obama's response but read Howard Kurtz  in the WAPO on the origins of Barack Madrasa story. Opposition research is a cool thing, right?



    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100587.html



    So here is the relevant section:



    The Washington Times did not touch the story about Hillary Clinton's camp supposedly spreading a rumor that Sen. Barack Obama, her presidential campaign rival, once attended a madrassa, a school that teaches a fundamentalist form of Islam.



    The paper blew off the report even though it was carried this month by Insight, the Internet magazine owned by the same parent company.



    Times Editor in Chief Wesley Pruden, calling it a "lurid account," declared in his column that Insight "is absolutely, positively and entirely separate from the newspaper." Pruden quoted from my reports in which Obama and Clinton spokesmen called the article trash, adding: "Neither this newspaper nor most others took up the story, which cited no named sources."



    Insight Editor Jeffrey Kuhner concedes that "the madrassa angle on Barack Obama had not been thoroughly checked out when we posted our story," but says "our story was about the Clinton camp's opposition research on Barack Obama, which had been thoroughly checked out. . . . The story gave our readers insider knowledge about what is truly going on in the Hillary camp. . . . Contrary to misrepresentations by The Washington Post and CNN, Insight's Obama story never -- not once -- claimed that Obama attended a madrassa as a young boy."



    The Insight article did say that an investigation by Obama's opponents "has discovered that Mr. Obama was raised as a Muslim by his stepfather in Indonesia." Both the Obama and Clinton camps have dismissed the allegations, and the deputy headmaster of the Indonesian school in question told CNN that it is a public school.

    - which &#8220;keeps a letter at its offices, signed by five members of the local

    - &#8220;If I were a Muslim, I would let you know&#8221;. At no point, does WaPo
    sully itself by actually reporting that Obama is not a Muslim. Understandably,

    men of the 70's and 80's .  you can not win with them and you will save your self
    a lot of pain. the reason i say this racial bais is alive and well.  I had a similar
    experience i wish to share upon arriving in washington dc. I had an issue arise
    and a white female brought tears to the issue and even though my position was
    correct . the idea that a minority   made a white female cried shaded the result.
    new hampshire  was your  to take but not responding to the teaR OF HILLARY  with
    the tears of  a  OPrah or  a non minorty entertainer you were going to lose .  a
    strong  black man can not win on  the national stage without  big name  in the
    business ,sports or entertainment  arena speaking on your behalf a loss is inevitable
    .  A win in November  for the democart will have to include  ex senator Edwards.  I
    have been a closet campaign strategist  and  I have been on track with most of

    has not allowed for him to ascend to popularity that you enjoy. By any measure
    you have more success than you really need, so &ldquo;spreading it

    having your campaign relinquish a percentage of your finances to the Mccain offices.
    Sending money this way, as your running mate Joe Biden sees it, could even be

---
<p>Dear Senator Obama,</p>
<p>I am writing to you from Hyde Park, Chicago, as your constituent and as a long-term supporter. I admit that I have been severely disappointed by your response to the stories peddled across right-wing sites that you attended a 'Madrasa' in your youth. Ever since the story broke, I had been waiting for your response and hoping that you will lay bare the fundamental prejudice and hatred underlining that story.</p>
<p>Today, I read the response issued by your campaign office and I quote:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">To be clear, Senator Obama has never been a Muslim, was not raised a Muslim, and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago. Furthermore, the Indonesian school Obama attended in Jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a Madrassa.</p>
<p>These malicious, irresponsible charges are precisely the kind of politics the American people have grown tired of, and that Senator Obama is trying to change by focusing on bringing people together to solve our common problems.</p></div>
<p>I was hoping that the response would not be to proclaim the horror of being insinuated a "Muslim" (Is it really such a terrible shame that one was born a Muslim?). I was hoping that you'd point out that the word "Madrasa" simply means "school". That every school in the Islamicate world has that word in its title - even the American or British. You could have shown them this school in Marrakesh <http://www.as-m.org/main.php?l=school&p=arabic> or this school in Doha <http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/img/oxed/international/floppy/doha1.jpg>. You could have refused to further the Islamophobia taken root in American society by stressing your appreciation of the cultural heritage you acquired in Indonesia. You could have simply said, 'While I am a Christian, I resent the implications in being branded a terrorist-sympathizer merely by association with Muslims. There is no direct correlation between a Muslim and a terrorist despite the demonizing efforts of certain groups. One cannot pass judgement on billions of people and their faith without recalling the histories of Jews in Europe or Africans in Americas.'</p>
<p>Instead, your campaign sought to play the defensive card. To stress your Christian creditability and to proclaim a vehement distancing from anything "Muslim". To simply call this story "a malicious and irresponsible charge" at you is wrong. It is "a malicious and irresponsible charge" at the millions of Muslim Americans and billions of Muslims around the world. You may have been the target of this mis-information but the victims are Muslims who must now defend their culture, belief and heritage, while living in America.</p>
<p>This is the state of Islamophobia in America today, where a simple declaration: "He is a Muslim" casts doubts on a Presidential campaign. I hope that you will make a further statement on this issue and lay bare the racist and phobic agendas in news organizations who make peddling such hatred their business.</p>
<p>I wish you continued success in your campaign and I know that I will be working to help you get elected in 2008.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
