    It's almost like he's <i>daring us</i> to make fun of him for something silly, so he can get away with some really serious shit while we're being snarky, or whine about how mean those pesky Democrats (and other non-Republicans) are.

    That last picture is just eerie. Like a nightmare about an old-school teacher with a paddle and a leer....

  content: Great photo analysis. But tell me, why didn't they think it necessary to
    even put bails on the wicket? I'm shuddering at the thought of SRT or Waugh winking
    at the camera that way after scoring a century..

  content: I can't stop staring at that ludicrous belt of his. I wonder how long he's
    practised bowling to get a form like that, though. then again, aping is his forte.

  content: You know, it's not like I've ever been massively fond of cricket (I know,
    weird for a desi guy, it must be the gay thing), but I feel an even greater distaste
    for it now, having seen Bush with a <em>balla</em>.

<p><img src="/img/bushcricket.jpg"/>Seldom is it that my worlds collide so drastically. But, a simple one-line email frrom desiknitter pointing me towards the photo-essay of the Chosen One in Islamabad's embassy row playing cricket with a bunch of kids while Inzammam and other looked on, did just that. No, it wasn't just the sight of the Chosen One engaged in the 'pastime' that consumes me soul, but how the photo essay stood in for all that has gone wrong for the world and right for the Chosen One.
