<p><a href='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/03/kumargogol.jpg' title='Kumar and Gogol'><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/03/kumargogol.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Kumar and Gogol' /></a>Many of us were surprised to learn that the actor who performed the role of Kumar in <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Harold and Kumar go to White Castle</a></em> with such panache will now be starring in <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/thenamesake/">the film version</a> of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel the <em>Namesake</em>.  There will be lots of publicity on this in the coming weeks; but for now, sepoy has forwarded me <a href="http://www.vmix.com/view.php?id=2190094&current_resourceid=2190094&type=video">this intriguing interview</a> with <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0671980/">Kal Penn</a> about his new movie.</p>
