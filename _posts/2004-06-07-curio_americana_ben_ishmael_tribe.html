  content: "I am the product of whites, blacks and reds living together in the Kentucky
    hills. My aunt has sickle cell and I have two cousins born with afros. These people
    have been called by various names over the years--melungeon (malun jinn) and black
    dutch, among others. \n\nTheir line is formed from various branches which came
    together in the isolation of Appalachia, where they originally congregated for
    safety. Some are the descendants of escaped slaves, some of Indians, some of Muslim
    Spanish/North African shipwreck survivors, some of criminal Scots-Irish white
    trash. The important thing to note is that for almost a hundred fifty years--that's
    five generations or so, none of these people had the luxury of prejudice. They
    literally screwed themselves into one color. \n\nThe gentry considered them less
    than human for years, and had it not been for their remote mountain homes, supposed
    evil powers and ways with black magic, they would've been the recipients of more
    vitriol than they were.\n\nThe supposed \"black magic\" I think refers to syncretistic
    hill religion borne of distant memories of great grandma speaking of how there
    is no god but god, etc. Modern white pentecostalism owes its quarrels with The
    Catholic Church and the trinity--especially its insistence on a unified godhead--to
    these memorial echoes.\n\nThe group to whom Sepoy refers is but one poor group
    of these melungeons, with a particularly strong tie to the distant parent faith.\n\nSome
    of those who remain in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia are \"rediscovering\"
    thier roots instead of trying to hide or lose them; they're down with identity
    politics and not into apologizing for their multiracial identity. They're bolstered
    by the generally decent work of a responsible amateur scholar named Brent Kennedy,
    who has worked with groups as diverse as the Turkish and Libyan governments, which
    are interested in proving Muslims have been on the continent as long as Jews and
    Christians."

    Addenda: During the post-war labor migrations, these ideas would have been of great interest to blacks living in Dearborn, who were then just getting to know their Lebanese neighbors. W.D. Fard, the Founder of NOI, was coincidentally not black. He did, however rise amidst this influx of immigrants from abroad and down south.

    As for the South Carolina flag, I can only speculate. There should be a history of the South Carolina state flag somewhere on the net.

    Dear Marlowe,

       I am doing my own research on the Tribe of Ben-Ishmael with the Indiana State Library. One aspect of my research concerns the infamous Revernd Jim Jones, and his shadowy-origins. It struck me that he did his early social-work in the depressed areas of Indianapolis--site of the Ishmaelite-ghettoes. He always said he had "Indian-origins," and this seems like something an outsider (or was he?) would say to the descendents of Ishmaelites. Any help would be greatly-appreciated, this a neglected-area of research.

  content: "Here we go, something to demythologize opportunistic racio-political myths
    made on the sterilized nuts of voiceless victims.\r\n\r\nfrom the introduction
    to Nathaniel Deutsch's\r\n\"Inventing America's \"Worst\" Family\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/11113/11113.intro.php\r\n\r\n\"There
    is only one problem with Hugo Leaming's ingenious and inspiring portrait of the
    Tribe of Ishmael: it isn't true. Ben Ishmael was not an \"Islamic saint or Imam,\"
    his name does not reflect a corruption of the Arabic \"ibn Ishmael,\" as Leaming
    also suggested in his essay. Nor was Ben Ishmael of African descent. Moreover,
    the Tribe of Ishmael was never an Islamic community, and the vast majority of
    the people identified as Ishmaelites over the years were of Western European background,
    although a relatively small minority did possess some African or Native American
    ancestry. Indeed, as I will show, a careful examination of all the published and
    unpublished sources on the Tribe of Ishmael reveals that only one of Leaming's
    major claims remains a possibility, namely, that some of the individuals identified
    as Ishmaelites may have become early members of the Moorish Science Temple and
    the Nation of Islam. In light of the available evidence, however, even this assertion
    does not rise beyond the level of conjecture.\r\nIf the evidence is so weak, how
    and why did Hugo Leaming arrive at his startling conclusions? Leaming had complex
    personal reasons for reimagining the Tribe of Ishmael as a primarily African American
    Islamic community. Born into a white, middle-class Christian family from Virginia,
    Leaming decided later in life that he was actually triracial and, despite his
    upbringing, became a member of the Moorish Science Temple, the first African American
    Islamic group. In short, Hugo Leaming assumed the same racial and religious identity
    that he invented for the Tribe of Ishmael. While Leaming's own dramatic metamorphosis
    helped shape his interpretation of the Ishmaelites, broader cultural and ideological
    currents also influenced his portrait.\r\nUnlike Oscar McCulloch, who \"discovered\"
    the Tribe of Ishmael when Islam was widely seen in the West as a religion in decline,
    Leaming produced his study of the Tribe of Ishmael in the immediate aftermath
    of the civil rights era in the United States, when prominent African American
    Muslims such as Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali had become cultural icons. At the same
    time, Islamicists in other countries were attacking Western imperialism and their
    own corrupt governments. By the 1970s, far from being a symbol of decay, as it
    had been for Orientalists during the nineteenth century, Islam had now come to
    signify in the eyes of many&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;including Hugo Leaming&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;robust
    and popular resistance to colonialism, racism, and economic oppression.\r\nIt
    is also important to appreciate that Leaming was able to reimagine the Tribe of
    Ishmael as Muslim because earlier authors had already exploited contemporary tropes
    of Islam in their own portraits, beginning, of course, with the Islamic sounding
    names coined for the group. In this respect, the Tribe of Ishmael's story sheds
    new light on what Vijay Prashad has evocatively referred to as \"the undisciplined
    world of U.S. orientalism.\"\r\n25\r\nContrary to popular belief, Americans did
    not encounter Islam for the first time in the second half of the twentieth century.
    Indeed, the roots of Islam in America date back centuries to the numerous Muslim
    slaves brought to these shores from Africa. Nor did it take Malcolm X or even
    the members of Al Qaeda for Islam to become part of America's collective consciousness.
    Instead, Islam has been present in the popular American imagination for centuries.
    As I will argue throughout this book, each stage of the Tribe of Ishmael's story
    corresponds to a different phase in this fascinating but largely unwritten history
    of American Orientalism.\r\n26\r\nOne way of understanding Hugo Leaming's radical
    reinterpretation of the Tribe of Ishmael, therefore, is that he literalized elements
    of their identity that had previously functioned on a symbolic level. Earlier
    writers like McCulloch and Estabrook had depicted the vast majority of the tribe's
    members as white Upland Southerners of Anglo-Saxon ancestry. At the same time,
    however, McCulloch and Estabrook symbolically likened all of the Ishmaelites&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;white
    and nonwhite alike&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;to marginalized groups such as Gypsies,
    Native Americans, and Muslims. In his revisionist study of the Ishmaelites, Leaming
    flipped the actual ethnic and racial proportions of the tribe's members so that
    African Americans now dominated numerically and culturally. Leaming also literalized
    the previously symbolic association of the Ishmaelites with Islam. Almost alchemically,
    he had transformed a collection of poor, overwhelmingly white, Upland Southern
    migrants into an African American Islamic community.\r\nDespite its mythical quality,
    Leaming's version of the Ishmaelites' story illuminates a number of recurring
    themes in the history of African American Islam. The first is the powerful role
    that reinvention has played in the creation of new and distinctly American Islamic
    identities. In this respect, Leaming's transformation of the Tribe of Ishmael
    into an Islamic community and Ben Ishmael into an \"Islamic saint or Imam,\" recalls
    the equally dramatic religious transformations of individuals such as Elijah Muhammad
    and Malcolm X. The second theme is best expressed by the Nation of Islam's phrase
    \"lost-found nation,\" that is, the idea that the original Islamic identity of
    African Americans needs to be recovered and restored. Seen from this perspective,
    Leaming's revisionist interpretation of the Tribe of Ishmael fits into a broader
    pattern of reclaiming the supposedly obscured Islamic roots of all African Americans.\r\nFinally,
    Leaming's identification of the Tribe of Ishmael as a \"colored\" community reflects
    a common American tendency to racialize Islam and, more specifically, to view
    it as a religion of nonwhites. To appreciate how deeply this racialization of
    Islam has penetrated the consciousness of many Americans, we need only recall
    Malcolm X's great surprise upon encountering blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims on
    his pilgrimage to Mecca or, more recently, how governmental profiling of terrorist
    suspects has relied on narrow and misleading assumptions of what Muslims are supposed
    to look like.\""

  content: "I agree overall with the Deutsch intro comments, there's an element here
    of American orientalism, possibly even linked to Freemasonry. I've ordered the
    book and will be writing a review, but I think it sounds spot-on. \r\n\r\nThe
    idea that the Ishmaelites were Muslims doesn't seem to hold much water, frankly,
    there's no solid proof of it, and therefore, it must be viewed as speculative
    only. \r\n\r\nBut they were classified as a group and--for all intents--wiped-out
    through eugenics laws after 1907 under the \"Indiana Plan\" where \"degenerate\"
    populations were forced sterilized and/or incarcerated under the law. That's a
    much more significant story because it could very well be cultural genocide, a
    high crime that might have to be confronted as a part of Indiana's history.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact is, they didn't have much of a problem associating with and even interbreeding
    (sorry for the term, it's meant technically only) with Blacks and Native Americans
    and simply didn't fit-in. The Deutsch book sounds like it might have few answers
    in it, at least one can hope so."

    against it.\r\n\r\nJP Lambert:  Pretty sure  Canton MI was not founded by Chinese,
    ;-),  but I did grow up in the western burbs of Detroit and  there used to be
    a Nankin and Pekin townships in western Wayne Co.  Nankin Mills is still there
    on the Rouge River. Apparently there was a China-mania back in the 1800's.  And
    admiration for the Greek general of the 1800's  Ypsilanti. Someone took an interest
    in the wider world.  Cheers."

  content: "A while ago I spent some time studying this tribe through oral stories
    and literature. There are many similar stories of disenfranchised peoples from
    different races coming together and creating their own communities and culture.
    Most prominently are The Black Indians of New orleans.\r\nOne thing that is important
    to note about Ben Ishmael Tribe is that they \"disappeared\" or assimilated. Which
    means that there are many oral histories to be gathered that will not be found
    in books. When people have a reason to hide their history, they often find elaborate
    ways to continue practicing their beliefs through \"costumed\" or \"veiled\" expression.
    To look deeper, you should explore The Shriners in these areas, and you will start
    to uncover some very interesting things..."

  content: "I appreciate that there are people showing interest in my people.  But
    I must add a few notes.\r\n\r\nWe did not disapear.  We have done what we have
    always done.  We hide in plain sight.  \r\n\r\nThe first arrivals were brought
    by the Spanish in the late 1500s.   Spain was unsuccessful in colonizing the Americas.
    \ They left many behind in the area that would be known as the Rowland/Orange/Person
    counties of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe second group would be brought here from
    the Netherlands and England.  Some before the Puritans, New Amsterdam.  For the
    next 75 boatloads of Roma from all over Europe would be used as labor and explorers.
    \ Who else to explore a new frontier than those who had 500 years of history being
    in a strange land surrounded by strange people? \r\n\r\nThe next wave of Roma
    would come from Scotland and Germany.  The Scottish were often expelled Jacobites.
    \ \r\n\r\n\"Scots Banished to the Plantations\"  is an excellent source to see
    who was sent here and for what crime.\r\n\r\nAll of these different groups of
    Roma migrated into NE Eastern Kentucky,  specifically Wolfe and Magoffin County.
    \ We stayed there from 1790 until about 1920.\r\n\r\nThe racial purity laws of
    that time made it very difficult.  Starting around 1880, the people in north eastern
    Kentucky started traveling to Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois.  They would then go
    through the mid west Arkansas, Missouri, and over to Colorado.  They would go
    south to Florida over to Texas.\r\n\r\nWe would change our names from Roosa to
    Rose.  Brandenburg to Brennan.  Nickel to Nicholson.  We'd change our first names
    from Elvira to Evelyn.  Josephus to Jo.\r\n\r\nWe'd join Baptist churches.  We'd
    start churches.  We'd hide among the Freemasons.  We'd become governors and lawyers.
    \ We'd start cults.  We'd start homeless shelters.\r\n\r\nWe do all the things
    everyone else does.  Some good.  Some bad.\r\n\r\nWe're people just like anyone
    else.  We're Jews, and Muslims, and Atheists, and Mormons.  But on the inside
    we are Roma.  Among friends we are Roma.  \r\n\r\nSome still travel to this day.
    \ Others haven't traveled for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nBut we didn't go anywhere.
    \ We're right here as we've always been.  Hiding in plain sight."

  content: There was no "Ben Ishmael Tribe" except in Oscar McCullough's mind.  Ben
    Ishmael was a caucasian, revolutionary war soldier from Cumberland County Pennsylvania.
    He and his 2  brothers were possibly even born in Wales, where Ishmael is a popular
    last name, there are even two towns in Wales named St. Ishmael.  Ben Ishmael fought
    in the Revolutionary War for a total of 3 years, got married to Jenny about 1780,
    moved to Kentucky after 1783, had 12 children before he died in Nicholas County
    KY in 1822.  I am descended from him through my grandmother Letitia Ishmael Workman,
    she is Benjamin Ishmael's Great Great Grandaughter.  Ben's brother Thomas settled
    in Tennessee after the war, their brother Robert died of dysentery during the
    war.  There were very likely some of Ben's progeny in Indianapolis during the
    time McCullough was there, circa 1870, and they were very likely poor. Ben was
    always on or over the edge of poverty his whole life.

<p>I stumbled across a strange name in an American Historical Society Journal footnote: the <b>Ben Ishmael Tribe</b> out of Ohio Valley. The article was about settlements in Illinois in the early 19th century but it gave no further information about that name. So, I dug around. First on the web and then in the library. What I discovered was a strange little story from the American past - a past that seems largely forgotten. </p>
<p>What I write below has been taken, mostly, from <i>Gone to Croatan: Origins of North American Dropout Culture</i>, an edited volume by Ron Sakolsky and James Koehnline published in 1993. </p>
<p>I had always assumed that some of the slaves brought to Southern plantations from West Africa would have been Muslims - Islam being a heavy presence in North and West Africa as early as the 8th century. The beginnings of the <a href="http://www.noi.org/history.html">Nation of Islam</a>, always read to me as operating on that foundational myth of Muslim slaves. The name, Ben Ishmael, hence immediately struck to me as Banu Ismail - literally, the Sons of Ismail but better translated as the Tribe of Ismail. <i>Gone to Croatan</i> confirmed my hypothesis. Ben Ishmael were a collective of thousands of runaway slaves, Native Americans and "poor whites" who created a nomadic colony in the Kentucky Hills in 1790. They lived far from settled communities (for obvious reasons) and were forced out of inhabited lands at a regular pace. When Kentucky farmlands became slave-farms, they moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. From Cincinnati they were driven out, tracing a settlement pattern through Indiana and finally to various small towns in Illinois (mostly southern parts). Cities like <a href="http://mahomet.govoffice.com/">Mahomet</a>, <a href="http://meccain.areaguides.net/">Mecca</a>, <a href="http://moroccoin.usl.myareaguide.com/">Morocco</a> and <a href="http://users.stlcc.edu/jangert/cairo/cairo.html">Cairo</a> bear the names of some of these settlements. </p>
<p>They remained nomadic in nature - their 350 mile triangular migration route stretched northwest from Indianapolis to the Kankakee River south of Lake Michigan, south through easten Illinois (Urbana-Champaigne) and Decatur and finally, due east, back to Indianapolis. They make an entrance in James Fenimore Cooper's 1872 novel <a href="http://www.bibliomania.com/0/0/23/51/frameset.html"><i>The Prairie</i></a> as the family of a man called Ishmael Bush [though the tribe is "mostly" white in the book]. </p>
<p>The tribe became a persecuted - and prosecuted - minority as the regions continued to be settled and the 'morality' began to be enforced. Their nomadic lifestyle, rather syncretic religion, free-loving, free-economy ways were often at clear odds to the majority. One, Oscar Carleton McCulloch 1843-1891, high on the fumes of <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/arts/books/2003/09/ma_513_01.html">Eugenics</a> wrote a pamphlet on the Tribe that suggested forcible sterilization and incarceration for their members. The pamphlet, published in 1880, was only the second in the United States applying Eugenic science on a population. You can see some photos at the <a href="http://www.iupui.edu/~eugenics/index.htm">Eugenics Archive</a>.</p>
<p>The Ishmaelites disappear from historical memory after the Indiana Laws for <a href="http://www.statelib.lib.in.us/www/isl/indiana/eugenics.html">sterilization</a> of feeble-minded and subhuman families went into effect in 1907.</p>
<p>I was still curious as to what their relationship was with Islam or more specifically the Nation. They seem to have carried some notions of sacred Islamic sites and totemic nomenclature but little evidence of ritual or belief seems apparent. The founding mythology of <i>Nation of Islam</i> obviously owes a lot to the Ben Ishmael history. But their larger impact was on the cultural memory of Black America struggling to survive out of slavery. Some anthropologist needs to study the songs and sites of the Ben Ishmael Tribe. Maybe they have. I don't know. I just found this fascinating and thought...I'd share.</p>
<p>Furthermore: who are these <a href="http://www.hermetic.com/bey/catechsm.html">people</a> that I found at BoomBox.net? And what does it all have to do with the crescent on the South Carolina flag? Marlowe?</p>
