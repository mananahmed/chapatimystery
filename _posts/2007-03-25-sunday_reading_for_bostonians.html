  content: "Sorry, I'm spending spring break in Hawai'i. Again.   Is it just
    me, or is the self-loathing Cubs fan section of the Greenberg profile just <i>way</i>
    inappropriate? Wasn't it long enough?  And Soros is a morass of self-contradictions.
    Which isn't at all unusual for people talking about Middle East/American politics,
    but in his case it really hurts towards the end."

    but why did you hate it? Do you have an alternate interpretation of the mentioned
    verse in the Koran?

    all the insight of a blind man stumbling around without his cane.

  content: "3rdman: I believe my reason for hating it are pretty clearly stated above.
    But, allow me to be explicit:  The NYT publishes with the headline, \"New
    Translation Prompts Debate on Islamic Verse\" on a translation which hasn't been
    published yet [hence cannot possibly be generating any debate] and by an author
    who does not know the language of the Quran and cannot possibly know/understand/comprehend
    the 1300 years of 'debate' on that very verse in millions of pages of commentaries
    done on the Quran.   It may be hard for NYT's editors to ascertain but a
    10th reading of Lane does not - I repeat, does not - entitle one to any opinion
    on any word in the Quran or any other Arabic text...if one is illiterate in that
    language - and most specifically in Classical Arabic.  So, I ask myself.
    What is the point of that NYT piece? You know which commentary of the Quran they
    cite in the article - out of the hundreds of thousands of commentaries written
    since the 9th century? Sayyid Qutb - the al-Qaeda 'idealogue'.   That, my
    friend, is a hit piece on a religion in our liberal paper of record."

  content: "sepoy, thank you very much for your reply.  There is indeed a clearly
    discernable bias in the NYT article, but I was hoping for your view on the mentioned
    verse itself.   As despicable as it is for the NYT to publish an attack
    disguised as an article on a scholarly undertaking, your post seems to be an emotional
    response to the nature of the article; I would have loved to see you challenge
    the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; with your own interpretation
    of the same."

  content: "Unfortunately I cannot give so expert a summary as Jonathan Dresner might
    have, but our panel at AAS did go over quite well.  Not sure it was a barn burner,
    but I think we did manage to raise the eyebrows and pique the interest of the
    several people who were dedicated enough to show up at 8.30 on Sunday morning.
      Sebouh Aslanian kicked things off with a detailed and provocative examination
    of Armenian merchants transition from a 'trans-imperial cosmopolitan' ethics into
    a territorialized nationalism starting in the mid-18th c.  I found especially
    compelling his argument that the concept of diaspora is too over taken as a trans-historical
    category whereas it should be understood in the context of the nation-state concept.  Mana
    Kia followed with a probing analysis of the increasing importance of place of
    origin among Persophone Shias in Iran and India at the beginning of the 19th c.
    \ Particularly productive, I though, were the connections she suggested between
    the Mughal valuation of the Persian language idiom of writers from Iran, and the
    later yoking of linguistic identity to the Iranian nation-state.  My own
    paper used writings about Hyderabad State or by its' officials
    in the late 19th/early 20th c. to argue that colonial networks provided the conditions
    for Muslim modernists to conceive and disseminate alternative global political
    visions.  This Islamist internationalist moment, however, was foreclosed by both
    the British regulation of these connections, which fizzled into territorial and
    exclusivist nationalist ideas.  Engseng Ho as chair-discussant stole the
    show, as is his habit.  He described the papers as thematically linked in that
    they all examined last moments of global connection before parochialization and
    the narrowing of mental horizons.   Needless to say your absence, Sepoy,
    was deeply felt.  Not only because we missed your characteristically spirited
    and challenging contributions to the academic (and other) conversations —
    which of course we did —, but also because your paper had promised
    to look at the mid-19th c. recrudescence of countervailing connections in the
    Islamicate world.  Engseng had a few brief comments in which he tried to cover
    the gaping hole our papers left of the bulk of the nineteenth century, but quite
    truly only a valiant sepoy like yourself could have bridged the gap.  Perhaps
    you can offer us some further nuggets from the paper that would have been in this
    space at some point."

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>Had all things been normal, I would have been on a panel this Sunday morning, at the AAS in Boston. Instead, I could only hope from a distance that <a href="http://www.aasianst.org/absts/2007abst/Interarea/I-188.htm">Countervailing Connections: Islamicate Mobilities in Imperial Moments</a> proved to be the barn-rouser that I had imagined. So, today's late - very late - list of readings goes out to my peeps in Boston who must now have time on their hand. And maybe one of them can tell us how it all went. Or maybe Jonathan Dresner attended and he can give us all a summary as only <a href="/archives/univercity/islamic_history_at_the_aha.html">he can</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen up, <i>NYT</i>, before you go telling us that a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/us/25koran.html?ex=1332475200&en=83592cddb7f16c52&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">translation of the Qur'an</a> is finally causing some re-examination into the very soul of Islam, please ascertain that 1. this amazing translation is ACTUALLY published and, hence, someone has read or reviewed it, and 2. that the translation passes some normative standards like, oh say, the translator KNOWS Arabic. Man, I hated that article. So, go read it and enjoy my misery.
<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/24/AR2007032400753.html">Dictators and the Courts</a> - this time Hosni Mubarak is treating Egyptian Constitution as his personal doodle pad. You must pay homage to the American commitment to spreading God-given Freedom around the world.
<li>I asked <a href="http://www.hnn.us/blogs/entries/33902.html">this question</a> a while ago and finally, the <i>Boston Globe</i> is also wondering <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/03/25/life_studies/">why biography is shunned by the academy?</a> I don't know but there promises to be an excellent work on Raj Kumar by our friend at <a href="http://www.landoflime.com/archives/aside/resumption/">Land of Lime</a>.
<li>Mahmood Mamdani, in the <i>LRB</i> has an absolute <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n05/mamd01_.html">must-read</a> on Darfur, Kristof and the politics of higher moral grounds.
<li>Mahomet and his Heaven: <a href="http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25341-2626876,00.html">A Review</a> in the <i>TLS</i>. Putting aside the Danish cartoon thing, I wonder how one would go about putting this in production? I mean, even if no Muslim protests, how do you contextualize this play in a performance?
<li>Two goodies in the <i>NYRB</i>: George Soros is not afraid of the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20030">Jewish Lobby</a>, while Pankaj Mishra  - member of the Brown Lobby - calls to your attention <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20060">two well-deserved books</a>.
<li>Besides Soros, Zbigniew Brzezinski is also a cranky old man who hates the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html">War on Terror</a>. We have always been at War with Terror. Doesn't he know?
<li>Finally. In a recent bout with insomnia I began composing the opening paragraph of my own 10-15,000 word essay on Wasim Akram for the <i>New Yorker</i>. My opening was going to be about the fearless Srikkanth getting hit in the head by an Akram bouncer during the first inning of the 1989 test series and simply crumbling away for the rest of the series. Since NYer has not called me to write this piece [seriously David Remnick. Even you ain't got shit on me when it comes to profile pieces. Call.], I suggest everyone read about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/magazine/25baseball.t.html?ref=magazine">Adam Greenberg</a> and what happens when you get hit in the head with a fast ball.
</ul>
