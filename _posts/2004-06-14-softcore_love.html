    what! you traitorous knave, any movie with amitabh is ipso facto more important than the lesbokissing of these painted hoes, hema/zeenat, madhu/nimmi or any other females.

    even if he has somehow and startlingly acquired womanish hips.

<p><img src="/images/girlfriend.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Looks like I picked the wrong movie to <a href="/archives/talkies/communal_arts.html">write</a> about. While <i>Dev</i> is getting ho-hum reviews, another movie released on the same day is getting stone-pelted and the cinema-halls are getting burned. The culprit is Razdan's <i>Girlfriend</i> which is a love triangle featuring two girls. And no, the boy is NOT the most desired one. Shiv Sena is all about <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyID=5417414">maintaining civil discourse</a> in the society by burning cinemas in Varnassi and stoning shops in Bombay.<br />
Gay themed movies are not the most visible cultural phenomena in South Asia and the last movie that broached lesbian love, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116308/">Fire</a>, met a similair fate. Although, that movie, at least, had better critical reception that <i>Girlfriend</i> which is accused of being made <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3805905.stm">solely to titillate</a>.<br />
Worth noting that in either case, lesbians are created solely out of<a href="http://www.newkerala.com/news-daily/news/features.php?action=fullnews&id=22728"> circumstances</a>.<br />
Also worth noting that this movie is about being gay as much as <i>Titanic</i> was about seafaring in early 20th century.</p>
