<p>The Nobel committee continues its rampage of making-news: <a href="http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-10-13T165301Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-272136-1.xml&archived=False">Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank</a> of Bangladesh were awarded the Peace prize. A true pioneer - his <a href="http://www.grameen-info.org/">bank</a> gives loans without collateral, relying on a system of trust and honor - he has done more to fight poverty than all those Bono jeans at Gap. As of May, 2006, the bank has 6.61 million borrowers, 97 percent of whom are women. With 2226 branches, the bank provides services in 71,371 villages around Bangladesh. A truly deserving recognition. </p>
