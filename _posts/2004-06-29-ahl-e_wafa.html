    One of my favorite poems of Faiz, I have it written in my diary.

    I also brought Nuskha Hai Wafa with me to the US. In my case though, it was mine.

    Oh, and same experience with parents regarding godless communism and Faiz and fahashi and Manto.

  content: My parents didn't think that Faiz and Manto were godless communists but
    my mom still thinks that Manto's stories are fuhush. I think that we are lucky
    that we read Faiz when we were young and I feel sad for today's Pakistani youth,
    majority of them are totally ignorant of his works and life.

  content: "We are even related to Faiz from some Sialkoti connection but not even
    that gave him the seal of approval. Although, amma did discover my copy of <i>Dast-e
    Saba</i> and she still has it and I think she likes it a lot. \nI don't know about
    Pakistani youth but Faiz is one of the topmost Urdu poets (if not THE topmost)
    getting translated into English. Especially the work of the late, great Agha Shahid
    Ali."

    On my 17th birthday shahzad amin gave me a book of "Faraz" whom he had never read.  my father had read it, though, and he asked me, Who gave you this book? and in his eyes i saw something other than just  curiosity..................... later i found out that we two actually share the dislike for the poet ,although for different reasons. i found "Faraz" too loud, superficial and blunt. shahzad amin's literary ignorance and  sohail ahmad's social intellect simultaneously pushed and pulled me towards the the phenomena called "Faiz" and i was never strong enough to get out of it .i have lived faiz, lost in the sounds and colours of  his world. Munir Niazi is the only  contemporary voice i can hear or the color i can distinguish from him.
    Manto's name still gives smoke in our house hold,and smells like burning feathers.
    My pain is opposite that of Danial's, cuz i think Faiz, like anything else has recently been turned into pop,cliche or trend.....whatever you call it....i mean something which would make your feet dance but never get to your heart.Have you never seen his picture in Syed Noor's room?Now he is the poet of Musharaf, Nirma and Mushahid(karachi university)...........and me.

  content: "The act of translating is really mark of  dedication. A great translation
    indeed. Faiz was committed to Socialism and Pakistani intelligensia labelled him
    as \"godless communist\" but would you expect such a person to utter these words
    'buss naam rahay ga allah ka'. Faiz reinvents himself and his body of work does
    not seem \"dated\" to a specific era. Yes, this was the only book by my bedside
    in the US for so many years and the EMI tapes playing in the car stereo. A truly
    surreal experience to listen to Faiz on a desolate US highway.  I had overcome
    homesickness. One trains the heart to closet these thoughts of folks backhome
    to a dark corner that you try very hard not to visit. Its a tough task but sometimes
    you feel that you have succeeded. Then you read Faiz and the relentless deluge
    unleashes when you read/hear \"kar rahaa thaa ghum-e-jahan ka hisaab, aaj tum
    yaad bay-hisaab ayay\"  I agree with Aamir and respect his comments on Faraz
    because his diction is so different from Faiz but you can revel in their poetry
    by seeing Faraz as an unabashed lover and Faiz as a hopeless (or hopeful) romantic.
    If I can just put forward one suggestion. Faraz is difficult to read (and a bit
    expensive) because his collection is in several publications. Faiz's kalam is
    encapsulated in his single nuskha-hai-vafa. This makes the reading experience
    a lot different between these poets. I do feel going back to Faiz more often than
    any other poet. As long as we are talking bedside reading I also have Zehra Nighah,
    Jon Elya, Nasir Kazmi and Munir Niazi. Rgds Naveed"

  content: "On Faraz, I tend to agree with Aamir that he is a bit too mechanical for
    me. N. M. Rashid is someone I discovered in grad school and am quickly starting
    to really admire. Nasir Kazmi was Aamir's present to me and his rhythmic cadenzas
    and sparse language still brings a smile to me. Although his politics is a bit
    messy. \nSonY: Nani's Chachu? What does that make him? Our great grandfather?
    He wasnt THAT old!"

    I am not a Pakistani expat (anymore) and I am not going to recount all of those moments when I connected with Faiz's poetry.

    These few lines are to relive the memories of Sepoy and me sitting in our east third street apartment reciting Faiz and talking about home. I miss you man!

  content: just in hurry. Just wanted to ask you guys if all of you have seen "Faiz
    Ahmad Faiz - Aj K naam" a must have CD-Rom for any of the fan of Faiz sab.? If
    not, I would like to do something about it. It's no more in market and the guys
    at Enabling technologies don't seem to be interested (Remember their CEO, jehan
    Ara is busy straightening out PASHA) but I think I can do something about it.
    It's really worth keeping it.

    Google is sometimes very moronic indeed. Recently, I have discovered many bad things about it. No, they are not about privacy or any other worries. It's just that it keeps sending right people at wrong places and vice versa. Of course many other people are responsible for that.
    anyways, I hope to complete that review soon :$ and wish to share the original CD with as many as possible. As I said, it's out of printing and Enabling Technologies have no interest in it whatsoever. Something's got to be done from under the tables, you know!

  content: "I think its unfair to label Saadat Ali Manto as an author of lewdity alone,
    if one reads carefully stories like \"Kali Shalwar\" and \"Thanda Gosht\" they
    starkly portray the sheer pain and anguish of their time. I have read translated
    work of Manto and found in his work a craftsmanship of excellent observation and
    art of story telling. No wonder he inspire current geniuses of story narration
    like Rushdie. \nAlthough a big fan of Faraz but even with my loyalties towards
    him can't compare him to Ghalib or Iqbal genre. Faiz has always revoked my submissive
    Islamic spirit but apart from that his romantic poetry is class apart."

    i love faiz, and <i>ham dekhain gay</i> is one of my favourites, so i had to add my two pence worth.



    there's a stunning (live) rendition of this by Iqbal Bano that you have to listen to, if you haven't heard it already. it's linked to at this post -

    http://www.streetphotos.net/blog/index.php/archives/2005/05/13/hum-dekhain-gaay/



    another faiz favourite of mine is <i>nisar mein teri galiyon pe</i>



    <i>jo tujh se ahd-e-wafa ustavar rakhtay hain

    ilaaj-e-gardish-layl-o-nahaar rakhte hain</i>

  content: "ASAK  I believe Faiz sahab , Manto sahab were those who wrote what
    they felt. in words of manto sahab..\"may nay is muashray ko nanga paaya...to
    may nay woh hee likhaa jo dekhaa\"....(i have found this society nude, so i wrote
    which i saw.)...i believe our parents put a ban on these writers becoz in their
    time they have found these writers odd and there is always a subliminal environment
    against the odd. We like them becoz we read them as un biased reader. definitely
    part of communish and fuhush is not absent in this literature but i feel becoz
    we see much higher fuhush and nude society so its acceptable literature to us... definitely
    these guys were great and their work is still toooo good un matachable.  i
    also suggest if anybody would like to read than read Ghulan Abbas specially \"
    Anandi\""

<p><img src="/img/faiz.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6/>I discovered <a href="http://www.faiz.com/">Faiz Ahmed Faiz</a> when I was a senior in high school (FSc for those that know). My mother warned me specifically not to touch some authors as they were godless communists or had mature content. Faiz was one of them (Manto and Faraz the others). I bought <i>Dast-e Saba</i> (Wind's Palm) at a roadside vendor near Anarkali and secreted it inside my textbooks. I read it over the next nights and afternoons when amma was not looking. It is hard, even now, to say how deeply that slender volume of poems impacted me. I can state that the world appeared as if anew. Most of the poems in <i>Dast-i Saba</i> were written during his incarceration, 1951-1954, by the Pakistani state. This was not like poetry that I had ever read before. Sure, the idioms of Mir, Ghalib or Iqbal were there as was the Mahboob (Beloved) and themes of despair and longing. But more than that was a poet struggling to make sense of his political world and standing up against oppression. When I was leaving for US, I had in my possession a borrowed copy of <i>Nusqhahai Wafa</i> (Manuscripts of the Faithful) - his collected works. Instead of returning the book to Sohail's father, I sneaked it into my luggage and onto US soil. For the next year, I read Faiz every night. Page by page. underlining lines, reciting it out loud. Faiz was my connection to my home, to my people. His love was unconditional but his critique was severe. I do not think I would be the person I am today without Faiz.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I was reminded of all this by reading Deevaan's <a href="http://deevaan.blogspot.com/2004/06/themes-of-love.html">post</a>. And for that I thank him. I also offer my loose translation of one of my favorites from Faiz (<i>Hum Dehkain Gey</i>): </p>
<p><center><b>We Shall Witness</b></p>
<p>We Shall Witness</p>
<p>It is a must that we, too, shall witness,</p>
<p>That promised day</p>
<p>which is inscribed by fate</p>
<p>We Shall Witness</p>
<p>When the immense mountains of oppression</p>
<p>blow away like cotton,</p>
<p>When under the feet of these slaves</p>
<p>this land will throb,</p>
<p>When upon the heads of our rulers</p>
<p>lightning will strike</p>
<p>We Shall Witness</p>
<p>When from the House of God</p>
<p>all idols will be lifted,</p>
<p>When We, the Clean ones, the Outcasts</p>
<p>will be seated at the top,</p>
<p>All the crowns will be tossed,</p>
<p>All the thrones will be toppled.</p>
<p>We Shall Witness</p>
<p>Only His name will survive</p>
<p>Absent he is and present he,</p>
<p>The view he is and seer he,</p>
<p>The shout will rise, <i>I am the Truth</i></p>
<p>Which is me and also you</p>
<p>And His people will then rule</p>
<p>Which is me and also you</p>
<p>We Shall Witness</p>
<p>It is a must that we shall witness. </p>
<p></center></p>
