    side of the charpai but on the foot side?  What a complete disregard of
    traditional cultural norms!"

<p>I wish Angelina Jolie would just stay at that charpai and solve all our problems, with her ballpoint pen. </p>
<p>In related news, CM was nominated for Best South Asian Blog at <a href="http://www.brasscrescent.org/">Brass Crescent Awards</a>. Go look see at the best of Muslim-themed dishes the blog kitchen has to offer. I picked up a number of new reads. </p>
<p>I am also co-judging the annual <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/20359.html">Cliopatria Awards</a>, for best in history. More on that, in a month or so.</p>
