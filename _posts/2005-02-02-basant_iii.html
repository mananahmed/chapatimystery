  content: We are celebrating Basant in Karachi too but I have told my friends that
    we just can't do it right. No matter how much we try to celebrate and party like
    Lahoris but Karachi is not Lahore and Karachites are not zinda dilan e Lahore.
    It is just so beautiful to be there at this festival.

  content: Phew, thank god Eid falls before Basant now. Last time I was in Lahore
    for Basant was a few years ago when Basant fell a week before Eid-ul-Adha. Everyone
    in the city spent their money on kites and string (and the ladies buying yellow
    clothes), so when Eid came around no one had enough cash to do qurbani! And everyone
    was so exhausted after Basant that they didn't have the energy to celebrate Eid.
    After all, Lahore Lahore hai.

    thank the mullah's as usual they screw things up just bcoz they cannot fly kites its now a hindu festival .... read the newspapers how many mullah's are accused of molesting children its ok then ... these mullah's should b kicked up the backside .....first zia ul haq screwed us now its the mullah's....

    if basant is banned the loss of foreign exchange is enormous... pakistan needs trade and money   grow up

    has its own role to play but as far as Lahore stands up; its purely is LAHORE
    LORE eh badshao. Im kinda far away (in UK)from the exciting city physically but
    my heart goes out every time I hear about it. its just so exciting to be in Lahore
    on any occassion / @ any time during the whole YR.

    Hey,



    I've heard Basant will be on the 5th of March if it does actually happen. Is that right? And is there a big lead up to the event? When does muharram finish?

    Well Govt has imposed a ban on kite flying. but still people are not following the rules. Two days earlier a 3 year old child died coz her throat was cut by the thread (Dore) while she was going with her parents on motorbike. I think we should try to solve this issue and not fly kites. or atleast dont use these dore's. if they want to celbrate a festival they should come up with something innovative thread which should not cut throats of innocent people.



    I have heard it is on 5th march but dont have heard any official announcemnets about it.



    Also you people know that those guys who use metal threads give huge blow to Wapda and the losses are in billions.



    The public is not trustworthy at all. If everyone wants to enjoy they should really come up with a good solution instead of people dying and electricity transformers blowing up.



    This sounds harsh but this is the reality. I was also fond of flying kites and last year I saw a child who got killed while looting a kite on the main road hit by a truck and that was basant nite and I did not flew a single kite on basant and neither after that and i dont plan to fly kite on this basant eaither. Someone should come up with a better solution if you really wanna enjoy the festival.

    A.A,

    I am in the U.K but boy i miss LAHORE a lot......

    Basant is the special event and i have been flying kites since my childhood. BASANT is something special which cant be described....



    BUT brothers from past few years my attraction to basant is fading away........

    Innocent people dying specially children. I can't bear the news of a girl died in her fathers hands...and they couldnt do anything.............



    I just want to tell everyone that if ur fun is taking someones life than thats not fun its something very cruel.........

    i still want to fly kites but only if its safer to do...............



    JUST THINK ONCE BEFORE FLYING KITES, WHAT IF SOMEONE CLOSE TO U SUFFER ITS CONSIQUENCES.........

  content: It seems to be a deplorable condition that our youth has become addicted
    to this festival that has no cultural linkage to Lahore or Pakistan and claim
    an increasing number of lives each year. This was promoted during recent years
    by the nouveaux riches with a lot of easy money and the so-called culture lovers
    like Mr. Lashari, Mian Amir and similar ones. Due to the policies of these gentlemen
    and flow of money into a few pockets people have started forgetting to greet each
    others on their own religious and national festivals and adopted Basant and Valentine's
    day that have origin in nothing concrete but only mythologies. I believe maulavis
    have not much to do with the ban but its the sensible citizens and those who have
    lost their loved ones just because the fanatics want to celebrate the zealotry.
    Those how want this festival and those who approached the court to lift the ban
    along with the court who lifted ban are responsible for the deaths of slain innocents.
    Shame on all of us.

  content: Basant is a festivle of kites.We should enjoy it by using thin and smooth
    strings like the children use in in America etc. But also it is full of fun.The
    gay spirited sons of Lahore are very enthusiastic about it.Some parties act as
    Rivals.The rooftops are crowded.People cry aloud 'Bo-Kaata' throughout the day.But
    the most important thing is that we have moved away from our real culture .islam.
    and have adopted an Hindu custom. It is good but many precious lives of innocent
    people are lost due to the chemical string.We all should think about it guys.

  content: I think basant should be celebrated like it used to be back in the day.
    They have motorcycle antennas and collars to protect the bikers now so I don't
    see any reason why it should not be celebrated. Basant has been a part of our
    culture since before most of us were even muslims, so why now label it un-islamic.
    The indians think of basant as a Sufi festival. These mullahs will be the end
    of all things nice that are left in Pakistan so I recommend that we do whatever
    we can to celebrate basant.

    its true... but basant WAS a very powerful festival of Pakistan

<p><img src="/img/basant3.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Basant is all about the party. Families dress up, put their boom-boxes on the rooftops (and I do mean BOOM boxes), bring out the bhangra remixes, lots of food, tons of kites and strings, and every person you know - young and old. On adjacent rooftops are your neighbors and rivals. Afternoons start off amicably enough; genteel challenges, good-natured banter, innocent flirtations, there may even be gentlemanly agreements on avoiding <i>hath-pherna</i> [hard yanks]. Eventually, the shine wears off and competition heats up; boom-boxes get turned around to face the enemies, the girls disappear, the old ones abandon the <i>chaat</i> to the boisterous ones, the sharper strings come out, cuss-words fill the air, <i>AOWAYY! BOO KATA!!</i>. Night falls. Flood lights search the skies for that little piece of paper with reflecting patches. Time, for once, replaces Wind as your enemy. Fingers bleed, get taped, bleed. Proud patches of a day well-spent for the next week. The knee-high stash of <i>gudis</i> dwindles away. The string flies away from the fingers. </p>
<p>But that is not the Real Basant, Aamir would say. The Real Basant happens in the old city around the <i>Minar-i Pakistan</i>. That other one has no rules. Kids macking, sheesh. This Basant has rules, teams, <i>khalifas</i> [certified captain], referees. </p>
<ul>
<li>You stand on a bench (or in a small demarcated space) from which you cannot budge. </p>
<li>The <i>Lahori</i> rules stipulate a small standing place [2'x3'], allows big kites and restricts tugging. The <i>Karachi or Nawabi</i> rules stipulate a bigger standing area [30'x15'], uses smaller kites and allows tugging. The <i>Kabuli</i> rules have no restriction of standing area but do not allow any tugging.
<li>The <i>paich</i> [contest] starts when the referee blows the whistle and the two kites move towards each other.
<li>If one of the kite breaks away before the contact, it is null.
<li>If it breaks during the contest, that player loses.
<li>If both break, the refree decides who gets the point.
</ul>
