  content: '"City famous for Bollywood and the Bombay Stock Exchange"??? Of all the
    things about Mumbai, why pick these two in particular? Familiarity to intended
    audience, or attempt to juxtapose economic and cultural center?'

  content: "Wow, it's been a long time since I have been visiting my old blog rounds.
    I am so glad to see some are still not only alive but also kicking energetically.
    \ I keep hoping that maybe with internet and TV and other forms of communication,
    maybe we humans will get to know eachother enough that it will get harder for
    us to think up excuses to fight each other.. -Eva"

    young girl is holding a flag. In the middle east you'd have a young boy dressed
    in fatigues holding a gun - now that would be scary."

<p>Sorry for the paucity of content here. Expect things to stay muted until Feb. </p>
<p>For Chicagoland viewers, I will be on this panel on Wed. Hope you can make it. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Wednesday, January 14, at 4:00 pm<br />

4:15 pm: Panel Discussion featuring Martha Nussbaum, Tarini Bedi, Robert Pape and Manan Ahmed<br />
Reception to follow</p>
<p>In late November 2008, the world watched while terror attacks sunk Mumbai into chaos. The city, famous for Bollywood and the Bombay Stock Exchange, bounced back, but the attacks marked a milestone in the global war on terror. Join us as our panelists discuss the consequences of terror in Mumbai for India, South Asia and the world.</p>

<p>Steven Wilkinson is an Associate Professor of Political Science and an expert on colonization, ethnic conflict and nationalism in India.</p>
<p>Martha Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics and an expert on rights, justice and democracy.</p>
<p>Tarini Bedi is a cultural anthropologist who conducted her research with the Shiv Sena party in Mumbai and is the Associate Director of the South Asia Language and Area Center and the Committee on Southern Asian Studies. </p>
<p>Robert Pape is a Professor of Political Science specializing in international security affairs and the author of Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism.</p>
<p>Manan Ahmed, recent PhD in the history of Islam in South Asia, blogs on international affairs at Chapati Mystery with a focus on media and Pakistan.</p>
<p>International House at the University of Chicago is located at 1414 East 59th Street. Visit http://ihouse.uchicago.edu/about/about_contact.shtml for directions.

<p>The poster for the event, btw, captures beautifully what I wanted to talk about: Nationalist Consumption of Global Brands of Terror;  Or <i>Landa Jihad</i>: Versaces for Five Rupees Only. </p>
