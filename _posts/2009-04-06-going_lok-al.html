  content: "<i>*I apologize for the title.</i>   So you should Sepoy :)  To
    be fair, few of the other quotes will be as colourful as Lalu's; he is always
    good for a soundbite or two and nobody knows how to get the English media slavering
    better than the Bihari Babu. Don't know what he is getting worked about though,
    he should have the Muslim vote pretty much tied up where he needs it. Am looking
    forward to the Nitish-Lalu contest however, should have more melodrama than a
    Star TV saas-bahu soap imo :D"

    Sikand's books on \"liminal\" Muslim traditions, and his history of the Tablighi

    writing on these subjects...]"

  content: PS-- this year, all the razzmatazz is in Andhra Pradesh, with Telugu superstar
    Chiranjeevi's "Praja Rajyam" party giving sleepless nights to established parties
    in the state (not that it is going to win, but could well serve as spoiler); NTR
    Jr. campaigning for the Telugu Desam (led by Chandrababu Naidu, who stabbed his
    father-in-law and NTR Jr's grandfather, the legendary Telugu superstar NTR, in
    the back to take over the party) -- all this and a movement for a separate state
    in Telengana too, not to mention the Majlis-e-Ittihad-ul-Muslimeen, which (sadly)
    will likely win in Hyderabad's old city...

  content: "Red -  I like Ali Anwar and I mentioned his book \"Masawat ki Jung\" on
    a previous thread about literature in Urdu/Hindi, as I think it is rare to find
    a book that discusses caste in the Muslim community much less to find one that
    isn't an academic tract in English!!! It was a well thought out arguement and
    obviously grounded in the author's own experience.  I think we need to be
    careful of distinguishing between Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections; after
    all the RJD never won convincingly in LS elections at a time when they dominated
    the state in the 1990s but won across the board in 2004 - whereas they got trounced
    less than a year later in the state elections. I don't think voters suddenly changed
    their minds or reversed their decision in that course of time but reflect different
    priorities in different types of elections. It is also a function of the pre-poll
    alliances that each side will cobble together, with Congress, the RJD and all
    the major Left parties on one side; I would expect them to get the most of the
    Muslim vote share. You might recall that the Congress ran separately from the
    RJD in the 2005 contest with the LokJanshakti Party. The RJD also got hit with
    the record number of 'rebel' candidates as there was considerable discontent over
    the distribution of tickets in 2005.  From the CSDS data I have seen - admittedly
    only for the 2004 LS elections; Muslims and Yadavs overwhelmingly voted for the
    RJD combine, something that over 60%-70%. Interestingly, Dalits who are the other
    main plank of support were much less in favour less than 50% and this community
    had cast their vote relatively evenly across all the major combines (with the
    RJD being the biggest of course). So it seems that the Dalit vote is the most
    split and the one up for grabs - imo anyway. The importance of this is reflected
    in the fact that Dalits constitute the biggest social block in the state, with
    the Yadavs being next. I have no idea whether the picture is different for state
    elections but this seems to be the pattern for LS ones.  Q - Yes, I made
    some of the points in the reply to Red above. The problem with the Pasmanda Muslim
    Mahaz and other bodies is that there already are several parties competing for
    the Backward-Dalit Muslim vote and they have by no means resolved their own internal
    conflicts, just like other OBC-Dalit divides elsewhere. The controversy over the
    Nitish govt's decision to give Mallicks Backward status in earlier this year reflects
    this. It is going to take a lot to dent and unify OBC-Dalit Muslims imo and Dalit
    Muslims will have a powerful alternative in the BSP, which has already shown it
    can win power and forge coalitions and is a national force now.  You are
    absolutely right about Andhra politics but I am showing my northern bias here
    since I can only follow things in Hindi at best and have no knowledge of southern
    languages so this debate is shut off for me apart from what we see in the English
    press. Yeah, fiml stars have the razzmatazz but they often come off as damb squibs
    imo in elections; their posturing doesn't seem like they beleive it themselves,
    which is why I find it forced even for the ol melodrama - it is too much artifice
    and not enough heartfelt acting! and as for Maneka - Yawn, I found her boring
    in the 80s and she has only gotten worse with age."

  content: "Re: \"Yeah, fiml stars have the razzmatazz but they often come off as
    damb squibs imo in elections; their posturing doesn't seem
    like they beleive it themselves...\"  Not in \"the South\" -- NTR was Chief
    Minister 7-9 months after launching his party, and it has remained the principal
    \"anti-congress\" force for well over two decades now (Telegu Desam); MGR in Tamil
    Nadu is of course the model for actor-success in politics, and his successor Jayalalitha
    at the helm of the AIADMK was an actress too.  Even the lesser lights have played
    spoiler -- e.g. Vijaykanth's party got close to 7-10% (basically the proportion
    the BSP has been getting of late in Madhya Pradesh); under the Westminster system
    that means close to zero seats, but enough to serve as spoiler.  Chiranjeevi is
    polling ~15% or so, and if that holds up I suspect the Telegu Desam will be very
    sorry he's in  the race.  [Aside: Chiru wrote a funny yet oddly touching \"open
    letter\" to Bush when the US invaded Iraq, let me see if I can dig that up...]"

  content: Q - I meant in terms of the entertainment factor; clearly the film industry
    has produced a lot of stars that go on to become major political figures and 'political
    cinema' plays a role you don't really see in the North in the same way. Biggest
    we came is AB's career and that wasn't really much to boast off (owed more to
    the proximity to Congress imo). I think Southern cinema is much better at identifying
    with the subaltern consciouness in a way that can be politically mobilised, unlike
    in other parts of India.

    your point (for all her soft communal stance at times, one must give credit to
    Jayalalitha for focusing more on women's issue than previous Tamil Nadu governments/CMs
    have)...but man, youtube is a great treasure: the sight of all the Chiranjeevi
    rallies is thrilling!    http://satyamshot.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/chiranjeevi-files-papers-amid-fan-frenzy/  http://satyamshot.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/political-theater-in-andhra-chiru-ntr-jr/  (I

    the Lok Sabha elections and boy does it feel good, even though it is going to
    kill me to stay home on election day.   I don't know how true this is for
    other regional language papers, but the depth and quality of the Marathi papers'
    analysis of the Maharashtra seats and candidates, at least, far outdoes anything
    in the English press."

<p>Indian elections are around the corner and I am starting to compile links to read/follow. <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/index.html">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.in/intl/en/landing/loksabha2009/">Google</a> (also in <a href="http://www.google.co.in/intl/en/landing/loksabha2009/index-hindi.html">hindi</a>) seem like excellent first stops. Mark em. Yahoo's column aggregator is especially useful. But Google's "Quotes from our Leaders" has immediate applicability.("Had I been the country's home minister, I would have crushed Varun Gandhi under a roller and destroyed him without caring for the consequences for his hate speech against Muslims".
