    I agree with your point about the "gallows of authenticity" -- the futility of those discussions. But isn't Roy being quite careful, before she gets to Monica Ali, not to mention the language question? Perhaps that is what she is really talking about throughout...

    BUT: Another reading of her column is to take her point about "distance" quite literally. Certainly, Rupa Bajwa can't be accused of 'inauthenticity' along the Indian/Western axis, since Bajwa has spent nearly her whole life in Amritsar. The problem in Bajwa's novel, if anything, is its blindness regarding the class-positioning of her characters.

    In short, maybe what we're talking about here fundamentally is social class, and only secondarily acculturation and language-choice.

    <i>Such accusations of elitism or opportunism are never raised against those that write in vernacular language even though the literacy rate hovers at the bottom for everyone. </i>

    This is untrue.  I don't know why you're generalizing across Indian languages, and I'd be surprised if it were even true for yours.

    I have experienced both ends of this argument in some way - firstly having read books by Indian authors living in the west. There were some parts that made me think - this is just wrong, someone (a character) in this position/situation would never really act like/say this. But that was true for THAT author.

    I think the argument that only someone who has lived and continues to live in India can write well about it is flawed. A story is the sum of an author's views and imagination. Not having lived a life in India or not having seen people like his characters first hand would not necessarily limit a good writer from writing well. Conversely having seen things first hand in India does not mean you can write well or even accurately about it - at least I can't, yet.

    by others, usually critics in Western countries, as the 'new voice of X' (where
    X = the Subcontinent, India, Pakistan etc). It's as though these people are voiceless
    until someone from among them uses English (an Urdu Marxist poet made a similar

    expose novel may help that.  But, you're right, I feel.  Novels--and I speak as
    a critic, which is part of my profession--are evaluated almost solely on their
    contextual terms; on how well they incorporate disparate elements, how meta and
    self-referential they, how \"real\" they are, versus how real they \"sound\".
    It's a shame, because the entire theory and praxis of literary criticism is taking
    a nosedive into textual nitpicking, versus honest evaluations and appraisals of
    the merits of a story.   What people may also sometimes forget is that occasionally,
    the reason for writing in English, despite being desi, is that as a whole, the
    language is the most accessible.  I'm Punjabi, but I wouldn't write in Punjabi
    because as a writer, I'm looking to target a demographic that goes beyond purely
    linguistic barriers; I want as many people as possible to read as much of my work
    as possible, partly because of royalties, partly because of recognition.  The
    fact that I also happen to be more comfortable in English than I am in Punjabi/Hindi/Sindhi/Urdu
    is an unfortunate side-effect of my education and up-bringing, but my no means
    should it invalidate the merit and quality of my work."

    Dear Mr. Historian,

    I am in need of your research prowess. I am looking to find as much information about Muslim mirasies in Pakistan (Punjab) as I can find. There is nothing on the internet and there are interesting historical gossip in my family about which I'd like to learn at the earliest. See my email address. Thank you for your kind help.

    discussion... but thought I might try to make a small distinction? I'm not interested
    in where a writer is located geographically or his/her \"right\" to represent
    x or y or z. Writers write. About anything and anyone they choose to. In the language
    that they're most comfortable with. I'm interested in what happens when a character
    becomes unconvincing, or a narrative forces me to segue away from the text, for
    the wrong reasons. Sometimes this happens when the writer literally doesn't know
    his or her subject. This is clearly not the case with Ali, who sees Brick Lane
    in a certain way, or Bajwa, who lived in Amritsar, or Swarup. I'm saying that
    their characters don't work for me in literary terms: they don't live for me the
    way Mr Biswas does, or Yossarian does. I don't know whether Naipaul \"lived\"
    Biswas's life; I have no idea whether Yossarian was drawn from Heller's experience
    of war; and I don't care. Those characters, they're alive for me. Bajwa's attendant,
    Swarup's beggar turned quiz contestant, and yes, Hasina in Brick Lane--they don't
    work for me, as literary characters.  Why? I should be able to answer this.
    The closest I can come to is to suggest that these authors haven't made the imaginative
    leap into their lives. Is Bajwa's India authentic or not, is Brick Lane an accurate
    reflection of Bangladeshi immigrants in London or not? How would I know? And as
    a reader, not a critic, it's irrelevant. As a reader, what matters to me is that
    these books don't work for me, that they are unsatisfying--not as reflections
    of the real world, but as works of fiction. That's a minority opinion. But
    it's mine. As for language, you use what comes to hand, what is yours. As for
    authentic India, I live in this country, but I haven't the foggiest idea whether
    I would qualify as an authentic Indian. When you find one, let me know."

    Nilanjana: I entirely agree when you write that these works should be judged "not as reflections of the real world, but as works of fiction". That is exactly my point.

    In your column, you successfully question the debate on authenticity but then condemn "the books about India and by writers of Indian origin that come to us on an ocean of advance publicity" and that such books form, "<i>a body of writing by authors of Indian origin</i>, about India, that forms a library of hollowed-out books." My emphasis is to point that you are referring to more than Ali or Suri.

    Why are they <i>all</i> ringing untrue and hollow to you? why the constant low-level hum? my reading of your column was that it is because you don't buy the [indian] world these writers are constructing for you. I read it as a decrying authenticity and Amardeep as distance from the subject. This lack of "imaginative leap" could be either or neither. But why is it prevalent?

    "I entirely agree when you write that these works should be judged "not as reflections of the real world, but as works of fiction"."

    If "literature" (works of fiction) replaces the role of religion, as some contend, then this "literature" will neccessarily be a "reflection" of the "real world" because it will involve some form of ethical criticism (previously the duty of religious leaders).

    Further how far can "it's just a story" hold up to scrutiny when the authors themselves publically defend particular readings of their own text? It appears that when they do this the "work of fiction" becomes part of the "real world".

    Dear Ms. Roy
    I've been following your views and opinions for quite a while and was very impressed by your svelte presence at the Crossword Awards ceremony. I would be very grateful if you give my debut book of short stories 'Vinegar Sunday', a read. Vinegar Sunday is a collection of 13 short stories which revolve around the Probasi Bengali families living in a ramshackle old building called Halfway House. Their mindsets, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities constitute the flavour of the book.
    If you find the time and the inclination to go through the book, Id be simply delighted. I'd also value any comments that you might choose to make.
    Yours sincerely

    substance in the liver that can differentiate person X from person Y.  If Modernity
    is the idea that identity is a matter of choice, then Authenticity and Modernity
    are natural enemies. It's not a coincidence that the Canadian philosopher Charles
    Taylor's seminal book was titled \"The Malaise of Modernity\" in the French version
    and \"The Ethics of Authenticity\" in the American one. In its crudest form,
    authenticity is held to be a matter of one's genes, one's corporeality. These
    days, it's more acceptable to say that authenticity is a matter of direct experience.
    Thus, Shakespeare is inauthentic when he wrote about Ceasar or Hamlet. It does
    not suffice for Shakespeare to have read books by people who've had direct experience
    with Ceasat and Hamlet. Direct experience is not transmissible as text, just as
    one cannot become a Brhamin by merely reading the vedas or leading a scholarly
    life. Authenticity is ultimately a reactionary ideal. That Roy is otherwise an
    ultra-liberal is one of those banana-peels that the Universe likes to scatter

    Interesting post and comments thread.



    The unspoken assumption of those who would criticize "Indian writers in English" FOR writing in English is that these writers are to be held culpable for their reception as "authentic ambassadors" by some of their audiences (in the West?  not necessarily, or not only in the West; the Sundarbans of Amitav Ghosh's "The Hungry Tide" are, I suspect, almost as unfamiliar to his audiences in India as to audiences elsewhere).  Certainly they are complicit, in that they are aware of the manner and mode of reception, but that doesn't make them culpable in the way that Ms. Roy's piece appears to me to suggest.



    I'm certainly not taking the position that we retreat from the essentialism of "authenticity" to the essentialism of "literary merit"-- but I am suspicious of attempts to impose some sort of litmus test on Indian writers, or any writers, because they write in English.  Undoubtedly, the fact that they write in English is the legacy of, and encodes, a certain history (of colonialism, of elite vs. "popular" culture, of class, of-- to use Mahmood Mamdani's schema-- the "citizen" who inhabits the metropolis versus the "subject" out in "the countryside"), but many of the writers-in-English themselves are conscious of, and attempt to explore, these themes.  As well they might, for the histories cannot be denied (the criticism might stand on a different plane if the writers we were speaking of were blithely unaware of and oblivious to their position).



    I agree with Anil: "authenticity"-- or more accurately, the policing that authenticity necessitates-- runs the risk of falling prey to a reactionary politics (why stop at those who write in English?  What about those who don't DRESS in the traditional manner? Or those who don't worship? And what is the writer who is born and raised in India, or who merely visits occasionally, but is more comfortable writing in English than in any other language, to DO?

    --- the image of a mother putting her child to sleep cannot be evoked in a language
    that is alien to the relevant socio-cultural canvas of the fiction; the anger
    or frustration of a jobless young man in Delhi cannot but express itself in colloquial
    Hindi. I haven't read Brick Lane (I generally avoid Indian English literature
    for other reasons), but this alienation is what sprang up when I read Naipaul,
    Arundhati Roy and even Jhumpa Lahiri. Exactly as you put it succinctly, these
    books don't work for me! Jhumpa's case should be treated differently though,
    because, she quite consciously writes about such alienation."

<p><img src="/img/jhumpa.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6/>Via <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/002533.html">moorish girl</a>, comes another gripe about the literary quality of Indians writing in English about India - again on their "authenticity". I covered earlier the historian's <a href="/archives/optical_character_recognition/drive_by_historians.html">spat</a> around the same issue of who has the right to write about India - only pure-bred and indian-raised and indian-living Indians or these westernized diaspora hacks who come back to visit the grandparents and get a book deal to sponsor the trip because selling the exotic East is so much easier if the salesman is brown.</p>
<p>Roy <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage.php?hpFlag=Y&chklogin=N&autono=178991&leftnm=lmnu4&lselect=0&leftindx=4">critiques</a> these foreign-desis thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bajwa, Suri and Swarup appropriate the lives of people whom they do not understand; unlike Bibhutibhushan, who lived Apu's life of deprivation in the city and the village, unlike Mulk Raj Anand, who saw at first hand what the humiliations of an untouchable encompassed, they are at a remove from their subjects. And I do mean subjects.<br /> The fact that an appropriation is benign, or well-intentioned, does not make it any less of an appropriation. Monica Ali does a more sophisticated version of the same thing, using a journalist's techniques and a ham playwright's voice when she employs pidgin English to convey the pathos of a Bangladeshi woman's letters from the village to a luckier relative abroad.<br />This does not make their novels any less entertaining, in the cases of Bajwa and Swarup, or any less well-written, in the case of Monica Ali and Manil Suri. But it does set up a constant, low-level interference that prevents an astute reader from engaging with their novels at a deeper level. I would call it white noise, were it not so very clearly brown.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don't truly understand. Because comprehension is tied to the local - the land, the people, the <i>language</i>. If you are one of us, you will write for us, in our language. The gripe is not new but has an interesting history. In most cases, it comes from the gateholders of litrary culture - the critics. The popularity of the author in or out of India does not really matter. In fact, if the author gets lots of sales or good press in English, it further dooms them to the gallows of authenticity. Allow me to elaborate the broader charges made by critics. By adopting English, as opposed to Tamil or Bengali or whatever, the Indian author is said to alienate his Tamil or Bengali or whatever audience who do not speak or read English. This is either a pseudo-distancing that takes the author out of one category (family, native) into another (interloper, colonizer) or a real-distancing if the author is only of Indian origin and resident in the West. Concurrently, by adopting English, as opposed to Tamil or Bengali or whatever, the Indian author chooses the metropole, or native elites, as her audience. This is either self-superiority that enables her to speak to <i>them</i> on behalf of <i>us</i> or it is self-inferiority that makes her choose the colonial language and idiom for self-expression. Such accusations of elitism or opportunism are never raised against those that write in vernacular language even though the literacy rate hovers at the bottom for everyone.  </p>
<p>One of the first to face these charges was Kasi Das Prasad Ghosh (1809-73). In 1830, when he  published his volume of English verse, <i>The Shair and Other Poems</i>, he was branded  "inauthentic" for his mimicry. Hemchandra Bandyopadhyay's (1838-1903) nationalist Bengali poetry was also seen by Indian literary critics of the time as too heavily indebted to Shakespeare and Byron to be called Bengali, yet that did not hinder his popularity as the foremost imagineer of a united India. Shoshee Chunder Dutt's 1885 <i>The Young Zamindar</i> was the first prose work in English to come out in India to widespread acclaim and accusations of inauthenticity. Tagore's 1913 Nobel Prize for his English verses in <i>Gitangali</i> is the obvious highlight of this trend. Mulk Raj Anand's novels of the 20s and 30s dealt with societal ills of India. Yet, at that time, he was accused of speaking only to the elite to whom the issues of untouchability etc. were only of academic interest. In the 40s and 50s and later the same charge of elitism was leveled against R. K. Narayan, Ruth Jhabvala, and Anita Desai among many others. There was some moderation given to the careers of V. S. Naipul, Salman Rushdie, and Ashish Nandy who were heralded with both critical and popular acclaim during the 70s and 80s but the tide turned with the newest crop of writers led by Arundhati Roy's 1997 Booker Prize. The rise of hot publishing sensations chronicling India's inner and external monologues has produced the predicted backlash. Mango fiction made them mad. </p>
<p>Pakistan has a lag of about 30 years in terms of writers writing in English but the recent crop of Mohsin Hamid and Kamila Shamsie is already facing the same criticisms. </p>
<p>Uh. I need to get to work. Damn you blog.</p>
