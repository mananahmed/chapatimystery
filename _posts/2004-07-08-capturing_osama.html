<p><img src="/img/osama.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Bush Administration dropped mentioning OBL around late 2002 (just from my recollection - if I was in the library I'd Lexis-Nexis that) as the focus of War on Terror moved towards Iraq. Actually, I just saw this great page, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=42263">Flip-Flopper-In-Chief</a> where you can read # 14 yourself. Why was OBL dropped as Public Enemy #1? Because Bush wanted Saddam? Let's assume that the truth is more complex than that. The rhetoric from the Bush administration about the War on Terror has been that this is a "new" reality that has "fundamentally changed" the world. However, their actions belie that rhetoric. </p>
<p>Remember, that the Bush thinkforce pre-dominantly contains Cold War veterans and Soviet "experts". The reigning model for world conflict for the past 60 years has been aggression by the State which will need a superior power to counteract or counterbalance. In Winter 2001, that idea held on - there was a direct relationship between the Taliban (the State) and al-Qaeda (the nonstate actor) - and Afghanistan was invaded. </p>
<p>Now, if the War on Terror was indeed a "new" mode of operation, the Bush administration would have shifted their focus to combating various terrorist organizations through economic, clandestine and military-coop ways in various countries. Perhaps build a new coalition agency (like the Interpol) that could operate internationally and develop legislations in various countries to effectively combat terrorism. </p>
<p>The thinking should have been that these nonstate actors may take funds from certain States, they may even operate in those States but they do not <b>represent</b> the interests of any given State. Their agenda is their own and unique and it may dovetail here or there with a State but that is coincidental not conspiratorial. But the Bush Administration went on with the same-old Cold War mentalit&Atilde;&circ;. Invade Iraq because they supported al-Qaeda is the latest iteration of that rationale. It remains just as false as the WMD claim but that is not what I want to quibble with here. </p>
<p>According to the Statist model, it makes sense that Osama is not a priority. What difference does it make whether he is captured or not. Unless, of course, the difference is between getting Mr. Bush re-elected. The New Republic has a report entitled <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040719&s=aaj071904">July Surprise</a>, that claims that the Bush administration has been pressuring Pakistan to deliver a <i>High Value target</i> (HVT) <b>before</b> November -in fact - during the Democratic Convention:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must." What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July"--the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston. <img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>That Osama's capture will increase Bush's chance of re-election is a dubious claim. And from the way <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/000880.html">things have been going in Wana</a>, it is highly debatable that Musharraf can deliver Osama on such a timetable. Regardless, the larger War on Terror remains mired in the Cold War context - looking for dark enemies in every nook and cranny (remember the Axis of Evil?). Can Kerry promise a truly <i>new</i> way?</p>
