    now for the jackasses upstairs to go too!

    say bye to ed for me, and my apologies for dropping off the face of the planet when he needed, uh, moving supplies.

  content: "Thanks... for the rather touching send-off.  I was totally expecting to
    see, \"good riddance to that bloody wanker who drank all my beer and burned a
    12\" square hole in our carpet while we were in Pakistan.\"  It wouldn't have
    been unwarrranted you know!  Lisa and I couldn't have stayed sane without you,
    Kitty, Maha, and Kavi.  After all, when we first moved into 6051 you guys were
    the only neighbors to offer a hand and not snicker at us from your warm living
    room window while we push-started our Reagan era Subaru \"luxury\" station wagon
    in 20 below Chicago weather.  And Kitty, thanks so much for tolerating our cat
    and man-eating plants while we were away.  We still owe you major babysitting
    time. \n\nOne minor quibble:  It's Greenville dude, not Woodville."

<p><img src="/img/edlisa.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>My dear friends and neighbors have officially moved out and started the trek towards Woodsville, South Carolina where Lisa is gonna kick it old school as new faculty. On N.P.R. you hear, "This part of the program brought to you by the generous support of YadaYada". If the last 5 years of my life were a radio-play, you would hear, "This part brought to you by the generous support of Ed & Lisa".<br />
Ed has been my sanity foil in many classes, workshops and presentations. Mostly because of him, I developed a genial social life. Nothing will top having them in our building and hanging out in the backyard or on the porch, cooking up some rice pilafs and grilling up some lamb & lighting up the sheesha. I have no idea what the hell I am going to do now.<br />
Everyone I know is leaving Hyde Park. They are either on research trips in Luckhnow and London or starting jobs. Sigh-ness.<br />
So fare thee well, Eduardo. I will see you soon, insh'allah.</p>
