    Good list, but you forgot one. You don't hear it much these days, but it is the view held by only the truest believers:

    7. Islam is not the problem - God is [Iqbal in Shikwa]

    Or expressed in a different way:

    8. Islam is not the problem - I am [Ghalib, et al]

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/islamjihaad.jpeg">Timothy Garton Ash, in the <i>Guardian</i>, says that there are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1570236,00.html">"six different views often heard in the west, but also, it's important to add, in Muslim countries such as Iran"</a> about the Troubles in Islam. These views, according to Ash, say much about those of us who hold them [whether they say anything about Islam is up for grabs]. His essential point is that the reader/thinker's own bias towards secularism, liberalism, multi-culturalism, colonialism etc. determines which of the six they choose.</p>
<p>Let me summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Islam is not the problem, all religions are - abandon them.
<li>Religion is not the problem, Islam is the problem - it needs to be reformed.
<li>Islam is not the problem, Islamism is the problem - it needs to be fought.
<li>Political history of Arabs is the real problem - it lacks democracy.
<li>The West - colonialism et al - is the problem.
<li>The problem is where prurient, lost, young Islam meets the hedonist, imperialist West.
</ol>
<p>Ash seems taken by #6 himself. I have snarked on most of these readings here at CM for their essentialism, their lack of historical and cultural specificity, their mis-reading of Islam and Islamicate societies etc. Yet, I wonder if we can refine these possibilities a bit more:</p>
<ol>
<li>Islam is not the problem - horny, unemployed, recently migrated Muslim men are [Olivier Roy]
<li>Islam is not the problem - Islamic history trapped in the "Golden Age" is [Bernard Lewis].
<li>Islam is the problem - Qur'an needs vigorous editing [Manji, Rushdie].
<li>Islam is the problem - Wahabbism has overtaken it [Hitchens, Friedman and all tele-pundits].
<li>Islam is not the problem - Muslims are: they breed too much and are on welfare and don't assimilate [Talking points in Europe].
<li>Islam is not the problem - Zionists who mastermind all attacks are [popular local press in Muslimistan]
</ol>
<p>Well, gentle readers, which one do you choose? Please let me know. My views on this are <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/that_terror_thing_iii.html">here</a>.</p>
