    I am looking forward to see what the more Eurabian (lol) focus will bring.  Also,
    as someone who has just moved to Germany as well after a PhD in the UK, I hope
    your transition goes smoothly indeed. Me and my wife live relatively close to
    Berlin, and it would be a pleasure to meet you, if you are ever up for it - she
    has done a fair ammount of work on (and in) Pakistan, and it would be lovely to
    chat with you.  My email is danielfrp@gmail.com.  Once again, congratulations!
    FU made an excellent decision, and I'm sure you'll have plenty of opportunities
    ahead of you in Berlin, where serious Pakiatn expertise is somewhat lacking.  Cheers,
    and the best of luck,  Daniel"

<p>Well, the Chicago adventure has run its course. Off to Berlin, where I will be joining the Freie Universit&Atilde;&curren;t faculty as a Juniorprofessur of South Asia history in the <a href="http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/">Department of History and Cultural Studies</a> and the <a href="http://www.bgsmcs.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html">Berlin Graduate School of Muslim Cultures and Societies</a>.</p>
<p>Which means: Transitions!</p>
<p>The good news, I presume, is that CM will go on - perhaps with a stronger Eurabian focus. To shore up my U.S. base, I am bringing on a new guest writer on CM and will also persuade lapata and farangi to re-awaken from their long slumber.</p>
<p>The bad news is ... there is no bad news! It is 130bpm on ze kraftwerk machine all the way to Berlin!</p>
