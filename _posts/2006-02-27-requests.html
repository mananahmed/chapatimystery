    coincidentally, just found out via amardeep singh's blog that ahmed shah abdali, although the nemesis of our good people in the deccan, was also a poet. had no idea.
    good luck finishing soon, looking forward to it!!

<p>My readers are such lovely people. They know that I am just goofing off under the pretense of being busy. So, they do not hesitate to ask of me what they want. Here is gentle reader, Jeff:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">Dear Mystery Man,</p>
<p>I see from CM that you are (a) hip and (b) someone who appreciates music.  Perhaps you can help me with my quest to find some good South</p>
<p>Asian hip hop / rap.  When I was in India last summer I got hooked on Juggy D, who had a hit album.  But other than Rakim's "Truth Hurts" and</p>
<p>the occasional Rishi Rich remix, I don't hear that much over here.</p>
<p>My Desi coworkers are much more into Bollywood showtunes, and the WASPs don't know who Jay-Z is.  Help!</p>
<p>Jeff</p></div>
<p>Well, Jeff, I am so hip that I know that all the kidz these days are on MySpace! And that's where you will find <a href="http://www.myspace.com/desirap">PakMan</a> and <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=39780949">Jay Sean</a> and <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=7188908">Rishi Raj</a> and tons of others. Just follow the links. The music itself is available easily enough through the internets [you should be hip enough to know how] or desitunez4u or desihitz or <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=277740">here</a> etc. Of course the big name is <a href="http://www.thepunjabirapper.com/">Bohemia</a> aka Ra Da Punjabi Rapper [might I add, <a href="/archives/better_with_tablas/ra_da_punjabi_rapper.html">of CM fame</a>]. But the truth is that my readers are way hipper than I am and they will leave recommendations in the comments. So, discover and send us a note back on what you find worthwhile. Lastly, sorry about your workplace.</p>
<p>The next request comes from gentlest of all readers <a href="/archives/noted/akbar_is_available.html#comments">like thabet, nitin, & zack</a> about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4740570.stm">this</a>. I was going to  have some fun with pointing out the archetype of warrior-weapon but I don't have my joseph campbell handy. After all, mythic warriors from Beowulf to King Arthur to 'Ali to Khalid b. Walid to Arjuna to Aragorn to Dick Cheney have all had a named weapon of [mass] destruction [quizman can supply the names of these glorious weapons in the comments, no?]. Now, just leave aside the delicious irony of Ghaznavi or Ghauri being ambassadors of culture, why would the Pakistani state want to name their missiles after them? Friends, all this and more is indeed covered in my dissertation. I beg of you all two more months on that request. And yes, Nitin, I need the next one to be named Qasim. I need it. </p>
