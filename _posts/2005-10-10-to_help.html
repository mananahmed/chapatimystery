    Thank you for the links.. I found this on ADP's website..


    Zia Chishti, the CEO of TRG and Orthoclear, has demonstrated his generosity by matching the next $25,000 raised by ADP! Beginning at 6:00pm EST, Monday, October 10, each dollar you contribute will be matched by Mr. Chishti (up to $25,000 in matching funds), producing double the impact for the many victims of this disaster in Pakistan. Please be generous in your donations!

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/earthquake.jpg">I have tried, I am trying, to get an online donation setup. The last resort will be my own paypal account but I am in contact with a couple of charity organizations that operate in Pakistan, and whom I trust, and hopefully some online thing will materialize.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crescentlife.com/thisthat/community%20org/edhi_foundation.htm">Edhi Foundation</a>, is the organization that I can wholeheartedly recommend to you. They have no web presence and no ability to mobilize online. I just talked to them and there doesn't seem to be any way that they will even agree to an online system. "Edhi sahib nahin mantay," is a direct quote. In any case, you can send your checks to:</p>
<p><center>Earthquake in Pakistan<br />
Bilqis Edhi Foundation<br />
42-07 National street<br />
Corona, New York, 11368</center></p>
<p>They are a registered charitable organization. For your tax purposes, their TaxID is 11-345067. Also, <a href="http://www.emullah.com">emullah</a> garnered wire-transfer information: </p>
<p><center>Bank Name: Habib-American Bank, Jakson Heights, NY.<br />
Name on the Account: Bilqis Edhi Relief Foundation<br />
Routing # and Account # 026007362-32001014<br />
Please write on your transfer special nature/purpose Earthquake Relief in Pakistan<br />
Phone Number for Bank 718-397-0890<br />
</center></p>
<p>Second, is this missive from the Pakistan Embassy as a response to my query: </p>
<div id="blockquoted">The President&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s Relief Fund is receiving donations from the Pakistanis, overseas Pakistanis and the international community. The Embassy of Pakistan Washington has opened a designated account with the National Bank of Pakistan to receive donations for the President&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s Relief Fund. Donations can be made through checks payable to President&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s Relief Fund. Tax deductible donations can also be made through checks made payable to &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&circ;&laquo;<a href="http://www.reach.org/">Reach International</a>&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Iuml;&euro;. All such checks should be mailed to the <br />Head of Chancery, <br />Embassy of Pakistan, <br />3517 International Court, NW, <br />Washington, DC 20008.<br />
The Embassy will acknowledge the donations made to the President&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s Relief Fund through Reach International. All donations made by the community organizations and individuals will be announced on the Embassy&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s website.</div>
<p>Third, donate online to the <a href="http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=014932&tid=001">Canadian Red Cross</a> effort. </p>
<p>Fourth, <a href="https://www.irw.org/donate/">Islamic Relief</a>. </p>
<p>Also, I want to acknowledge that the US-State Department announced <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/sa/rls/pr/2005/54633.htm">$50 million in aid</a> today. Along with the most important, and severely lacking, rescue equipment. <b>My heartfelt thanks to the US state and to the many, many people who called and emailed inquiring about my family's safety</b>. </p>
<p>More, soon.</p>
