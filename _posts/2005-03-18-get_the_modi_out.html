  content: Yours is the only argument against denying the visa that has made me ambivalent
    on the issue. It would be very hard if not impossible for America to arrest Modi
    under international law, even if they wanted to. SOMEONE needed to b*slap him
    - and perhaps this was the only way. But I see your point.

  content: "Wow, strong response.\n\nI see your point about censorship (though it's
    not *quite* censorship), and agree that there's no real reason to deny his visa.
    He's not been indicted or convicted of any crime in India, even if many people
    (myself included) already think he's guilty. \n\nMy theory is that someone in
    the Congress leadership made a phone call to the State Department about this;
    my suspicion is that that may have had more to do with the visa denial than the
    assortment of leftie South Asian orgs and Muslim groups that were planning protests.
    \nPerhaps Cong. was worried Modi would use this as a BJP fundraising mission?"

    The big difference between Ramadan and Modi... is that Modi did not just (allegedly) speak out in support of terrorists. He IS a terrorist. He shouldn't be any more welcome in the US than bin Laden or al-Zawahiri. Well there is one distinction there... unlike Al Qaeda, the Sangh Parivar has not attacked the US... yet...

    PS: Did anyone else get a serious chill thinking about representatives of one of the world's most dangerous terorist organizations reaching out to a national association of hotel owners?

    A major political party? True... the BJP has many members and supporters, but it it serves pretty much the same role for the more radical elements of the Sangh Parivar that the Sinn Fein served for the Provisional IRA...

    Like Modi, bin Laden has probably never personally pulled a trigger or set a bomb (all the tall tales of Osama's Sergeant Rock-like exploits against the Soviets notwithstanding). He just gives orders, makes suggestions and provides material and moral support. Does that make him any less of a terrorist?

    Yes, Modi is an elected official. That fact suggests that something is seriously broken in India.. not in the US...

    I'm with Sepoy on the visa denial. It would have been fine if the hoteliers had
    disinvited him from fear of losing customers and advertisers. \n\nThat said, I'm
    not sure that censorship is the key here. I mean, he would probably have spoken
    about doing business in Gujarat, not Pogroms R Us."

    sepoy, i mostly agree with you about the logic of the denial; it cuts both ways.

    i agree as well with zia that what is truly alarming is that he was issued the invitation to begin with. it is possible that the hotel owning desi contingent is still largely gujarati but i don't know how it is possible to not view this invitation as at least tacit endorsement of modi as a viable political figure in the wake of godhra and after. much work remains to be done on consciousness raising in the american diaspora.

    and i have to disagree with the person above who dismisses the bjp as not a major political party. they may have been swept out of office but they're far from done. and as someone who lived in delhi in the years leading up to the demolition of the babri masjid i have no illusions about the nature of the support they had then, and probably still do, for their religious agenda.

  content: "Sepoy,\nI am an activist with CAG and I am very disappointed to see that
    you are trying to make a comparison between the visa being denied to Modi and
    to Ramadan. \nModi's visa was denied based on the International Religious Freedom
    Act of 1998. He is in violation of many International laws. He has been criticized
    by the Supreme Court of India (Zahira Shaik ruling) and Human Rights bodies (NHRC,
    AI, HRW) for his complicity in the Gujarat pogroms and the aftermath. See <a href=\"http://coalitionagainstgenocide.org/reports/2005/cag.02mar2005.modi.pdf\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">this Modi dossier</a> for more details and on the cases pending
    against Modi.\nRamadan on the other hand had not been condemned by any Human Rights
    or Legal bodies nor was he in violation of any US or international laws.\nApples
    and organges Sepoy!\n\nBTW, it is incorrect that mostly muslim groups have lobbied
    against Modi. CAG consists of almost 40 Indian American orgs and of those barely
    3 can be described as Muslim orgs - <a href=\"http://coalitionagainstgenocide.org/about.php\"

  content: "Z: You are right. Modi and Ramadan are two different species. Denial of
    visa to enter the US, however, is the same. Should the same \"punishment\" apply
    for both?\n\nMy simple case is this: Invoking and cheering dubious US law for
    people you are against but condemning the same law for people you are for, makes
    little sense to me.\n\nWhy was pressure not exerted on the hoteliers to dis-invite
    Modi? Why was pressure not exerted on US to charge Modi when he got here? Why
    was a civil case not filed against Modi in US courts? Why wasn't a media blitz
    of protests and media-information launched for his entire tour? \n\nAll I am saying
    is that denying him visa to come and talk to some hotelwallas does exactly what
    in terms of bringing him any justice? Also, I haven't checked but is MSM or even
    the blogosphere taken any notice of this? Technorati shows mere 400 posts and
    none by the main bloggers seem to be interested in this great victory [hello instapundit?].\n\nLastly,
    I did not claim that \"mostly muslim groups have lobbied against Modi\"."

  content: "Sepoy,\n<i>Why was pressure not exerted on the hoteliers to dis-invite
    Modi?</i>\nPressure was exerted by CAG and its member organizations. AAHOA refused
    to relent. Protests were planned for Modi's arrival at the convention. CAG will
    still be carrying out a rally at Madison Square Garden tomorrow during AIANA's
    broadcast of Modi's speech. The protests in Florida will still go ahead as a peace
    rally for Gujarat victims. Protests were also planned against Cal State Uni which
    had invited Modi to inaugurate its India Center.\n\n<i>Why was pressure not exerted
    on US to charge Modi when he got here? Why was a civil case not filed against
    Modi in US courts? </i>\nCAG was and is working in this direction. But there are
    existing cases against Modi in Indian courts (please read the dossier). The diplomatic
    agreements between US and India would lead to any case against Modi (an Indian
    citizen) being thrown out if the Indian courts already have a case on similar
    grounds lodged against him.\n\n<i>Why wasn't a media blitz of protests and media-information
    launched for his entire tour?</i>\nA blitz of protests and media-information has
    been active. Press releases and Op-Eds are being sent out daily. But keep in mind
    that CAG is a grassroots organization and as such will not get much attention
    in the US or Indian media. The little reporting that was done as a result of many
    man-hours put in by volunteers often resulted in sloppy reporting by local media.
    How do you think it is possible to get US media's attention on the visit of a
    little known indian politician, when even desis don't know that there was a massacre
    in Gujarat in 2002? And its not due to any lack of trying. It is just very difficult
    to get the public and the media interested. \nThe State Dept.s action has now
    brought attention to this issue. \n\n<i>does exactly what in terms of bringing
    him any justice? </i>\nModi's visit to US was one among series of attempts by
    BJP and his Hindutva supporters to whitewash his image. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak
    Sangh (RSS) of which Modi is a pracharak, is promoting him as the next leader
    of BJP and a potential candidate as the Prime Minister of India. \n\nModi was
    not elected Chief Minister the first time he became one - he was selected and
    promoted by RSS when Keshubhai Patel was kicked out. The 2nd time he won elections
    by fanning religious hatred after the 2002 pogroms. AAHOA and AIANA were promoting
    Modi as a 'dynamic young leader' 'great orator and statesman' and as vital to
    the Indian American business community.\nModi's visa cancellation does this:\n-
    Got Gujarat pogroms back in picture\n- Damaged AAHOA's propaganda about Modi's
    business viability to American Gujaratis\n- Is a very minor victory in the much
    larger struggle against fundraising and lobbying in US by extremist Hindutva ideologues.
    \n- Sets him up as 'damaged goods' for BJP in international politics.\n\nAgain
    about Modi vs Ramadan, Modi is in violation of laws both US (IRFA) and <a href=\"http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa200012005\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">international</a>. \nRamadan was not in violation of US or international
    laws - his visa denial was based on suspicion raised by Daniel Pipes & Co. \n\nThe
    difference between the two cases is Denial of visa due to legal violations vs
    denial of visa due to suspicions raised. I dont' see a problem in supporting the
    former and protesting the latter.\n\nModi has so far gotten away from being brought
    to justice thru corruption (see the Supreme Court of India's ruling on Best Bakery
    Case) and intimidation (Zahira Sheik, Haryan Pandya murder) in India. Something
    had to show him somewhere that Gujarat genocide will haunt him.\n\nAbout the last
    line, yes you are right, sorry about that - I misread you."

    Right on, brother!

    I don't think the two situations are identicial, given that Modi was a little more responsible for the deaths of a few thousand people (he's more like Pinochet than a scholar, in my opinion), but I appreciate your skepticism of U.S. state power and your defense of the freedom of expression (which is truly needed these days).

    getting higher education.I want  to get degrees of MBA and then PHD in economics.As
    ill-luck would you have it I am unable to receive further education for the want
    of capital.In addition to it I donot have any sources by dint of which I may get
    any sourt of course.And receive the higher education for my coming generation.In
    this regard I want to ask wheather the higher education is only for them who are
    rich and land-lord persons.Such a poor student like me can have only the idea

    <strong>Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead</strong>

    ...maybe it's the time of day, but I can't help feeling conflicted, despite that I had previously expressed shock at the fact that Modi was given a visa at all. I wish the repulsion of Modi had come from a change in desi community perspective rather ...
---
<p><img src="/img/modi.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>One more thing. <a href="http://www.cinnamonpeeler.blogspot.com/">Wanderer</a> kindly send in a BBC link to Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, being <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4360259.stm">denied</a> visa by US of A. I criticized the US for preventing Tariq Ramadan <a href="/archives/imperial_watch/keep_out.html">entry</a> and called it censorship. <i>This</i> is just the same. </p>
<p>Modi was complicit, at the very least for his non-existent response to the carnage, in the Gujarat <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/godhra.htm">riots</a>. He deserves to be tried in a court of law for that. He was coming to the States on the invitation of <a href="http://www.aahoa.org/">Asian American Hotel Owners Association</a> and was going to speak at Madison Square Garden. Many, many South Asian groups <a href="http://nyc.indymedia.org/feature/display/144301/index.php">protested</a> the invite. Including members of US <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1055324.cms">Congress</a>. They lobbied the State Department and got the refusal they sought. Of course, Modi is saying that the denial of the visa is an <a href="http://www.newindpress.com/Newsitems.asp?ID=IEH20050318100421&Title=Top+Stories&Topic=0">insult</a> to India and he will now assume the posture of a martyr. Congress <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1056088.cms">makes</a> the usual weak response. </p>
<p>Muslim groups were part of this <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-18-voa12.cfm">lobbying effort</a>. They should know that the weapon of censorship is, and will continue to be, aimed at them. Modi and his politics are despicable to me and I would have said so, given the opportunity, to his face or outside his arena. Denying him entry makes him a martyr and rallies his troops but it does not bring any justice to the matter. If the US was going to arrest him upon arrival and charge him for human rights violation, I would have applauded that. But, this denial serves no purpose. You cannot compromise on a principle and expect your opponents to not throw that in your face. If Tariq Ramadan was denied his right to come and say what he had to, then Modi was denied his right to do the same. And I was denied my right to go applaud Ramadan and protest Modi.</p>
