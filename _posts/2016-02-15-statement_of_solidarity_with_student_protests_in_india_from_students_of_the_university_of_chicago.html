  content: "I'm all for freedom of speech and against any autocracy, as I have been
    a proud citizen of two free nations. I'm also NOT a member of any Political Party,
    Sangh, Parivar or Radical group in India or America and have many Hindu and Muslim
    friends worldwide; but, after being a college and university student in both India
    and the US, I wonder, whether these students at the university of Chicago can
    issue the same Statement of Solidarity in America and get away with that, if such
    things happen at a university campus in the US, under the same circumstances,
    (for an example in case of Osama Bin-Laden; from his hunt to capture and burial
    in the sea? And if so, how the people of the United Sates and government would
    have reacted to it? Would they have ignored the meetings of these students at
    their campus, after they had chanted \"Death to America\" \"From Every Home a
    Osama Would be Born\", and \"We will fight till the end to Destroy America to
    realize Osama's Dreams? Are we then going to call America a Fascist nation?\r\n\r\nBeing
    progressive is not a fashion, but it is a very important thing that must bear
    some responsibilities. Anti India slogans at JNU was disturbing and students seem
    to have crossed all the lines. These, students certainly owe an explanation not
    only to the political pundits, but to everyone who loves India. I will doubt the
    intentions of those who do not love their own country, but claim to be the harbinger
    of freedom for the rest of the world!"

  content: "As a signatory to the statement and an Indian citizen, I would first of
    all point out that you seem to have ignored several facts from the students' side.
    Since there is plenty of discussion of this on the internet and I have no doubt
    you will find it if you look, I will not get into it here. But I will say this:
    you may be disturbed by the slogans, as many of the students at that meeting were,
    or you may treat them as an invitation to think about things like, why are they
    so disturbing to us? That is certainly what I would hope universities enable students
    to do. Whether it happens in the US or not is neither here nor there; there isn't
    an American handbook of 'best practices' that we are out to sell in the statement.
    \r\n\r\nWhat do you love when you love your country? that is the question our
    friends from JNU are being reviled for raising. Do you love a person/leader, a
    symbol (flag; song; animal), a community, pieces of land? What does it mean to
    love these things and, at the very same time, hate/abuse/attack one's fellow citizens?
    I would think people like Kanhaiya are actually schooling us in asking these questions,
    asking where 'all the lines' they are supposed to have 'crossed' are, who drew
    them and what they say about us. That's what a university education is about-
    so it is 'everyone who loves India' that owes THEM an explanation, because they're
    doing what students ought to do and being punished for it."

  content: "Dear Team Chapati Mystery, This is in response to your &ldquo;Statement
    of Solidarity with Student Protests in India, from students of the University
    of Chicago&acirc;&euro;\x9D. When you &ldquo;strongly condemned the
    arbitrary, unconstitutional, and anti-democratic actions of the BJP/RSS/ABVP/Delhi
    Police continuum at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    you forgot to mention another Party which is stunned to witness such a demonstration.
    &ldquo;The party&acirc;&euro;\x9D is the common Indian citizen that
    is left stunned hearing Anti-India slogans praising and sympathising a terrorist,
    Afzal Guru, who confessed his interview to a private news agency. The slogans
    also were directed towards freedom of Kashmir from Indian occupancy and we also
    learnt that Kerela and West Bangal is also under &ldquo;Indian occupancy&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    now and demands its freedom. Let me start by I assuring you that I have no formal
    affiliation with any of the above mentioned agencies and by appreciating your
    concern in the matter of India, Indian politics, social/political reforms etc.
    First of all I failed to understand your right to &ldquo;demand&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    in the context. By practicing what right are you in a position to &ldquo;demand&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    here? A Request? Yes, that you may by all means. By the way, who was this letter
    of solidarity was addressed to? The ruling Government or any official? Well then
    you need to be made aware of a certain protocol that needs to be followed when
    you address any government of any country with certain salutations. Would you
    write the same way to the Dean of your University? So in the name of basic courtesy
    and courtesy and etiquette kindly do use appropriate salutations. And in absence
    of a proper address, your letter is vague as your knowledge of the stated event
    and the events that has led to it. In your letter you said that &ldquo;the
    ABVP was involved in raising the controversial slogans that are being cited to
    justify the sedition charge&acirc;&euro;\x9D? If you go through the video in the
    link below and you will know when ABVP enter the demonstration and what their
    slogans were all about. The evidence is right before you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re
    here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ENmjAPOZuY T\r\n\r\nhat being said, when
    you claimed that the &ldquo;Indian political program imagines the
    citizen as upper caste, heterosexual, male, Hindu; and is against the Muslim,
    the Dalit, the Left.&acirc;&euro;\x9D You, I believe will be please to know that
    our Prime Minister belongs to OBC caste and not even a week ago the same brigade
    of students protested in front of RSS&acirc;&euro;&trade; head office in Delhi
    and called our Prime Minister a &ldquo;Bhaduwa &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    A pimp&acirc;&euro;\x9D, &ldquo;Dalla &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; A pimp&acirc;&euro;\x9D,
    &ldquo;Bhangi &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a Dalit&acirc;&euro;\x9D, &ldquo;Bhangi
    ki aulaad &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Son of a dalit&acirc;&euro;\x9D and a lot more.
    If you talk about &ldquo;tolerance&acirc;&euro;\x9D, no sedation
    charges were imposed upon the students then and no common public even took the
    matter in their own hands. The authority dispersed the crowd with a light lathi
    charge. And for your information, addressing someone as &ldquo;a
    bhangi&acirc;&euro;\x9D is a non bailable offence in India as per the Indian Penal
    Code. We TOLERATED that, everybody did. I apologize the use of the above words,
    they certainly oppose my sensitivity but I had to bring the matter to your attention.
    Anyway, when all that failed to provoke the Government, and Authority, the JNU
    students along with other Afzal Guru sympathisers decided to take it a notch further
    and shout Anti-India and Pro-Pakistan slogans. THIS, chapatti mystery team, is
    beyond my sensitivity and sensibility. WE AND MY FELLOW INDIANS WILL NOT TOLERATE
    THIS. And most importantly Why did these guys resort to such extreme protest,
    I think we both know the agenda and the propaganda behind it. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
    we? If you have problem with the Government, delhi police, RSS or ABVP by all
    means you have the right to protest but DO NOT shout Anti-India slogans on my
    land. Anti-India slogans in any definition of patriotism will not make them a
    patriot in our eyes. Yes, we do have rights in our country and we also have set
    of duties towards our country and please don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t forget that.
    And don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be afraid, the government and the agencies do not
    have the last word in this country. We have something called law and courts. If
    the crime of sedation has not been committed / proved then they will be released.
    We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t hang, behead or even amputate people here just on
    the basis of some complaint or suspicion. : ) P.S.: If you were protesting against
    capital punishment in the country, you could have used other examples instead
    of Afzal Guru. There were quite a few rapists who were given capital punishment
    for their heinous crimes."

    and determination against the malign state power being directed against you. Many
    of us, sitting in faraway lands, are watching you closely and wishing you the
    very best. I am sure you know that Kanhaiya, you and many others are fighting
    the good fight, on behalf of a large number of people. \r\n\r\nAlso, if there
    are more tangible ways people can support you, please let that be known.\r\n\r\nBest

<p>We, the undersigned, strongly condemn the arbitrary, unconstitutional, and anti-democratic <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-row-students-journalists-attacked-in-court-premises/article8240518.ece">actions</a> of the BJP/RSS/ABVP/Delhi Police continuum at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus. We demand an immediate end to all police action on campus, a withdrawal of all frivolous charges against the President of JNU Students&acirc;&euro;&trade; Union, Kanhaiya Kumar, and other students, as well as an end to the campaign of harassment and intimidation against students at the university.</p>
<p>We believe that these actions by the Indian state and its associated groups and institutions are part of a larger campaign to stifle dissenting voices in the country, especially on university campuses which have persistently resisted the capitalist, Brahmanical hegemony of the current government. This was clearly evident in the institutional murder of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit PhD student at Hyderabad Central University (HCU) last month. The similarity of the modus operandi in Hyderabad and Delhi is striking: Rohith and his comrades had been accused of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;anti-national&acirc;&euro;&trade; activities for their condemnation of the hanging of Yakub Memon, and suspended from their academic positions on these undemocratic grounds. Similar charges have been framed against the students of JNU for organizing an event in solidarity with the struggle of Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination. To make matters murkier, it is now certain that at the event, which also marked the third anniversary of the execution of Afzal Guru, the ABVP was involved in raising the controversial slogans that are being cited to justify the sedition charge. We are of the firm opinion that protesting against state violence is a fundamental right that must not become vulnerable to arbitrary violation by governments, police and university administrations.</p>
<p>We believe that the colonial-era laws of sedition -- already <a href="http://kafila.org/2016/02/12/arrest-of-kanhaiya-kumar-a-short-summary-of-the-law-of-sedition-in-india/">diluted and read down</a> by the Supreme Court -- are an embarrassment to India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s democratic principles. The criminalization of dissent in this case reveals how India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s current political leadership has been unable to respect diversity and guarantee the full legal rights of its people. Its political program imagines the citizen as upper caste, heterosexual, male, Hindu; its economic program necessitates a blind faith in neoliberalism; and its social program continually imagines an enemy - the Muslim, the Dalit, the Left. It is not surprising that a government so debilitated and blinkered by its ideological narrowness has invoked the charge of sedition and sent police forces into the JNU campus, an action reminiscent of the worst years of Emergency.</p>
<p>We are also distressed by views expressed in certain sections of the Indian media regarding the legitimacy of political activism in public universities. This argument claims that since central and state governments subsidize education in public institutions, it is the responsibility of beneficiaries to refrain from critiquing state policies and to solely prioritize their studies. We firmly reject this cost-benefit understanding of education as shallow, apolitical, and deeply reactionary. As the saying goes, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire&acirc;&euro;&trade;. The current administration and sections of the media would prefer students to remain uncritical of the violence of Brahmanism, communalism, and neoliberal capitalism. But the Rohiths of the world will keep lighting a fire and keep burning down bigotry. We believe that both public education and free speech are fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution, rights that have been earned through long struggle and rights that we will keep fighting for in India and elsewhere as we face systematic neoliberal onslaughts on dissent and education.</p>
<p>To our friends, colleagues and comrades in JNU, HCU, FTII and elsewhere, we stand with you in your resistance against state sponsored violence, which curbs any form of dissent on the one hand, and on the other, condones hate speech by Hindu nationalists. We believe that scholarship and the concomitant development of our critical faculties should be used in dreaming of and implementing a better, pluralistic and just society.<br />
