  content: "Good stuff!  Interesting you say it's \"unprecedented\" that the
    PPP has now come into its own as a national party.  But (correct me if I'm wrong),
    hasn't the PPP ALWAYS had the best claim to being a national party among all the
    Pakistani political parties?  i.e. it won substantial seats in Punjab even in
    the 1988 and 1993 elections, didn't it?  Or were you making the point because
    of its strong showing this time even in NWFP and Balochistan (I don't know how
    the party had done in these provinces in earlier elections).  [Aside: I'm
    pleased at the ANP's strong showing in the NWFP]."

  content: "Yes, to the later point. The 90s elections saw PPP entirely absent in
    NWFP and barely there in Baluchistan. So, these gains are noteworthy.   thanks."

  content: "But wasn't the 1993-1996 government in the NWFP headed by the PPP? Aftab
    Sherpao was Chief Minister... so it wasn't completely absent...  I too am
    delighted with the ANP's showing... they have won two seats in the Sindh provincial
    assembly too... of course they were from the Pashtun-dominated parts of Karachi
    but if I'm not mistaken, the PPP supported them in those constituencies...  An
    article in Dawn recently asked, \"Why not Asfandyar Wali himself as Chief Minister?\"
    Indeed, why not? Or, for that matter, Afrasiyab Khattak..."
