<p>    Let the Lion Dog be small; let it wear the swelling cape of dignity around its neck; let it display the billowing standard of pomp above its back.</p>
<p>    Let its face be black; let its forefront be shaggy; let its forehead be straight and low.</p>
<p>    Let its eyes be large and luminous; let its ears be set like the sails of war junk; let its nose be like that of the monkey god of the Hindus.<br />
<!--more--><br />
    Let its forelegs be bent; so that it shall not desire to wander far, or leave the Imperial precincts.</p>
<p>    Let its body be shaped like that of a hunting lion spying for its prey.</p>
<p>    Let its feet be tufted with plentiful hair that its footfall may be soundless and for its standard of pomp let it rival the whick of the Tibetans' yak, which is flourished to protect the imperial litter from flying insects.</p>
<p>    Let it be lively that it may afford entertainment by its gambols; let it be timid that it may not involve itself in danger; let it be domestic in its habits that it may live in amity with the other beasts, fishes or birds that find protection in the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>    And for its colour, let it be that of the lion - a golden sable, to be carried in the sleeve of a yellow robe; or the colour of a red bear, or a black and white bear, or striped like a dragon, so that there may be dogs appropriate to every costume in the Imperial wardrobe.</p>
<p>    Let it venerate its ancestors and deposit offerings in the canine cemetery of the Forbidden City on each new moon.</p>
<p>    Let it comport itself with dignity; let it learn to bite the foreign devils instantly.</p>
<p>    Let it be dainty in its food so that it shall be known as an Imperial dog by its fastidiousness; sharks fins and curlew livers and the beasts of quails, on these may it be fed; and for drink give it the tea that is brewed from the spring buds of the shrub that groweth in the province of Hankow, or the milk of the antelopes that pasture in the Imperial parks.</p>
<p>    Thus shall it preserve its integrity and self-respect; and for the day of sickness let it be anointed with the clarified fat of the legs of a sacred leopard, and give it to drink a throstle's eggshell full of the juice of the custard apple in which has been dissolved three pinches of shredded rhinoceros horn, and apply it to piebald leeches.</p>
<p>    So shall it remain - but if it dies, remember thou too art mortal. </p>
