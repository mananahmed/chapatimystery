    Sepoy,

    A tight match, but India is well capable of losing this one.

  content: i have liked Shoaib Malik eversince he won us a game against South Africa,
    I believe it was in Lahore. He single handedly led Pakistan to victory. Underdogs
    like Malik are what legends are made of keeping the mystery of the game intact.
    Great game but I suspect the inborn winner in Tendulkar fell prey to the negative
    tactics of chasing the bonus point rather than going for the whole ten yards.

    Sepoy,

    My brand of nationalism is well aware of India's strengths and weaknesses.

    It also says India will win the Asia Cup.

    :-) :-)

    deevaan: Yes! that was the inning as well where I became a fan of Shoaib Malik. A great striker and a great bowler. He needs bigger fans in PCB.
    nitin: do i detect a bet coming on...? a inter-blog, winner-takes-all (how about a graphic on the bottom somewhere saying Nitin Beat Sepoy or vice versa) and we will let the proxy fellas duke it out? Of course, India has to get into the final, first.

    on the Indian cricket team.  The only time I bet on anything, was on the cricket
    team, with my sister-in-law, that too half in jest. The hole it burnt in my pocket
    still hurts. But you can call me chicken. :-) Nitin"

<p><img src="/img/asia.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>On Sunday, India and Pakistan will meet in Colombo, Sri Lanka for their first round match in the Asia Cup.  Pakistan is defending the title it won in 2000. India is defending the can of whup-ass it opened on Pakistan in 2004.<br />
Yes, Pakistan has the new coach but if their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3913015.stm">performance</a> against Sri Lanka is any indication, I am not hopeful in this Sunday's encounter. The batting is atrocious. And no one took my suggestion to retire the whole squad. It is good that they have an actual physical trainer and the coach <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2004/JUL/001359_ASIA2004_19JUL2004.html">yelled </a>at them when they lost.<br />
I don't see the highly <s>professional </s>Pakistani squad sticking around for that kinda attitude. Oh well. Tendulkar is hitting in good form and the Indian team is playing around with opening combination.<br />
I perdict a tight match but India takes this one.<br />
<b>update</b>: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3919535.stm">Color me shocked</a>. Pakistan takes this one with Shoaib Malik hitting 143. I am starting to like this guy.</p>
