<p>Yesterday, we were supposed to go see Russ Meyer's magnum opus <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1995/03/971488.html">Faster, PussyCat Kill! Kill!</a> at Doc Films - which is having a banner quarter (kudos to the volunteers-check the calendar <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/calendar.html"> here</a>). I come home around 4ish and I am not even tired. Yet, when Eduardo called me at 6 to go, I was fast asleep. He could not persuade me to move, though he made one HELL of an argument that normally would have had me bolting outda door.<br />
I felt bad afterwards to have missed the movie on the big screen.<br />
I was looking around to see if T&A was an actual film term and I discovered that Barnes & Nobles has an excellent <a href="http://video.barnesandnoble.com/search/glossary.asp?userid=1zL3haZ4TC&CAT=1005877&TRM=1007235">Film Glossary</a> that covers every aspect of the film industry. Way to go B&N.<br />
Oh, the answer is No. T&A is not a accepted film genre. PussyCat would be a Girl Gang Film. Grumpy Old Man would be a Gerontological Film. And I am tagging Phenomenology genre as an upcoming post.</p>
