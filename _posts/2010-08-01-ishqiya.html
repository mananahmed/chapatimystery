  content: "Thanks for this thoughtful take on a film that deserved more careful attention
    than it received, although I fundamentally disagree with your reading of the Hindu-Muslim
    fault-lines in this film.  I agree with your point about the \"shared spaces\"
    the characters of this film seem to inhabit -- and would add that the film inhabits
    an \"as if\" kind of space, namely the sort of space where the Hindu/Muslim fault-line
    doesn't really matter, whether in life in general or in love (or lust, for that
    matter).  As to whether this represents a fantasy or an authentic representation
    inaccessible to (the supposedly more civilized, more sedentary, urban and urbane)
    is a separate question -- but my point is that I really don't see any critique
    of the Hindu Right in this film at all (unless the point is that such representations
    of Muslims themselves constitute an implicit critique of the Hindu Right, which
    I do not buy).  You are completely correct that there have been many many films
    with the \"good Muslim/bad Muslim\" duality, but there also have been (more in
    this decade than in the preceding one) a number of films featuring Muslim characters
    whose \"Muslim -ness\" is simply irrelevant, in the sense that it isn't an issue
    (paradoxically, these films don't stick in anyone's memory because progressive
    critics tend not to think of these films as about \"Muslim issues\").  i.e. It
    isn't an issue in the way that it is in contemporary politics; that's how I tend
    to think of Ishqiya -- the Muslim identity of Shah's and Warsi's characters is
    in-your-face, but the film is wonderfully un-self-conscious about it.  Far from
    offering any kind of critique, these are two lowlifes on the run and (at least
    one of 'em) trying to get laid -- and they are able to be so in precisely the
    sort of Indian terrain (semi-rural/small-town eastern U.P.; Chaubhey said in an
    interview he is originally himself from Gorakhpur) where Muslim is just another
    kind of competing group identity (i.e., I see the Hindu Right, or Nehruvian secularism,
    as both just about irrelevant to the world of this film, which represents a certain
    cultural ethos, but does not make any kind of political claim).  The Bollywood
    song/lyric references were for me precisely the sign that the film was making
    a cultural, as opposed to political, claim.  [And, of course, the two male protagonists
    tap into a long tradition of lovable Bollywood tapori-types and ne'er do wells,
    many (though by no means all) of them \"minority\", ranging from Rishi Kapoor's
    and Amitabh's Akbar and Anthony over three decades ago to communally ambiguous
    \"Munna\" and \"Raja\" types.  In fact (and somewhat off-topic), the whole trend
    of Muslim gangsters represents an interesting variation; these have been (in my
    view problematically) dismissed by some progressives as examples of negative stereotyping
    of Muslims, but in my view are far more nuanced, and very different from the jihadi
    terrorist-sort.  i.e., what is different is precisely that, despite the 1993 Bombay
    blasts and their aftermath, the underworld bhai is often NOT seen as an \"anti-India\"
    figure; in fact he is almost always (if, that is, played by a hero) imagined as
    a nobler figure than the cops and politicians arrayed with and against him (and
    this is true even in the supposedly grittier films of recent years); and more
    likely to be on the side of \"the people\" than the establishment is.  The underworld
    \"bhai\" is often the glammed-up heir to the tradition of protest that one can
    trace back at least to Deewar's  786-badge-toting Vijay (it will be interesting
    to see if the recent Once Upon A Time in Mumbai seeks to introduce the good gangster/bad
    gangster trope into the Haji Mastan/Dawood story, with (as in the Godfather),
    the older man not being willing to engage in certain kinds of dirty businesses
    etc.).  Perhaps analogous to the law-breaking archetypal hero of hip-hop, this
    might explain why the bhai-stereotype is, in my experience, not felt by (younger,
    male) Muslims to be a negative stereotype the way the jihadi stereotype is (I
    do think that the older, more genteel Muslim sorts who write for mainstream English-language
    publications, be it a Saeed Naqvi or an M.J. Akbar, do tend to think of these
    as negative stereotypes). The \"bhai\", for instance, is generally not a rapist,
    a drug-dealer, or a pedophile, nor does he kill innocent people -- the sort of
    code B'wood does not expect from politicians, terrorists, and (often) policemen.]\r\n\r\nI
    fear I have ended up sounding more critical than I meant to be; that doesn't really
    do justice to my experience of reading the piece, which, in fact, itself suggested
    a lot of what I've said above..."

    mean, of course, from the mainstream media.\r\n\r\nAside: the film was linguistically
    very interesting to me as well.  In it, I heard expressions (such as \"chootiyum
    sulphate\" or its abbreviation \"sulphate\") that I had previously only heard
    in Karachi or from Karachiites (mostly those whose families migrated from U.P./Bihar).
    \ I had never heard this sort of thing in Mumbai, Hyderabad, etc., and it was
    interesting to see that sort of linguistic sign/trace show up in a contemporary
    Bollywood film.  BTW, for those not familiar with Pakistani TV shows, Munawar
    bhai is played by the Pakistani actor Salman Shahid.\r\n\r\nIn general, I loved
    the fact that one of your main prisms for this film was the idea of the vagabond.
    \ In fact, far from \"[t]he figure of the Muslim in Ishqiya [being] that of ...
    civilizing persona\", for me the seduction lay in the notion that today, only
    the low-life, the vagabond, the (I love this Hyderabadi expression) chindee chor,
    is the true heir to Ibn Batuta's restless spirit.  The cosmopolitans of today
    are no Ibn Batutas, even though we travel more than we ever used to; we are back
    in the big cities, watching this film with some measure of envy and disquiet --
    that sort of freedom is irretrievable to us..."

  content: "Part of <a href=\"http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2010/02/note-on-ishqiya-hindi-2010.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">a brief note</a> I had written on the film: \"Ishqiya is better
    than most films the Hindi film industry makes, even if its pleasures weren't the
    ones I was expecting. I went into the film looking for a taut, erotically charged
    thriller about a femme fatale manipulating two saps over a pot of gold, film noir
    in a bhaiyya-setting as it were. What I got was a compelling evocation of a small-town
    U.P. milieu (the (in)famous badlands of Gorakhpur district, along the Nepal border),
    a locale debutant director Abhishek Chaubhey has presented even more naturally
    than his mentor Vishal Bhardwaj ever managed with his out-of-the-way settings
    in either Maqbool or Omkara(that is to say, Chaubhey does it \"simply\", such
    that the presentation of the milieu (to \"outsiders\") does not itself become
    the point of the film). Thus, in place of the exoticized Muslim gangsters of Maqbool,
    we have Khalujan/Iftiqar (Naseeruddin Shah) and Babban/Raza Hussain (Arshad Warsi),
    two small-time thieves who don't perform either their \"Muslimness\", or their
    \"U.P.-ness\" -- the viewer simply finds them as they are. As (s)he does Krishna
    (Vidya Balan), the lady of the house where the two thieves have sought refuge,
    on the run from Mushtaqbhai (played by the famous Pakistani actor Salman Shahid)
    over the small matter of 20 (missing) lakhs. \r\n\r\nThe dialogs and interplay
    between the three principal characters are the best part about the film: each
    of the three loves to talk, and two of them -- Khalujan and Krishna -- share a
    great weakness for old Hindi film songs (the third, well, Babban's heart is more
    likely to skip a beat in response to Apna Sapna Money Money's \"Dekha jo tujhe
    yaar / Dil mein baje guitar\"; although, make no mistake, all three take their
    cue from that film's title), and the film is strongest when the viewer's ear is
    thus engaged.... \""

    \"\r\n\r\nIt is not at all uncommon for Muslims in my experience to say that \"we
    have it better\" than Hindus because there's no caste system, etc. (whether or
    not this is a claim that can be taken at face value is not the point; my point
    goes to Muslim self-image, especially that of the Urdu-speaking urban Muslim;
    conversely, there is some truth to it: the reality of caste prejudice amongst
    Muslims notwithstanding, it lacks the ritualistic valence -- and hence the caste-based
    violence lacks the ritualistic quality one can often discern with caste-violence
    in India).  I have myself heard it many times from relatives and others -- hence
    the frisson when I heard Warsi say this in the film; I was delighted to see this
    \"authentic\" touch here, and done in a way that wasn't nasty or bigoted, just
    bewildered (perhaps even a corrective to those -- in the Hindu Right or among
    the \"Muslim First-ers\" -- modern big-city-dwellers who tend to think of Hindu/Muslim
    as THE essential fault-line in India; only recently have Muslim Indian groups
    begun to cast aside their historic tendency to view \"Hindus\" as a monolithic
    bloc (the sort they represent \"Muslims\" to themselves as, but that's another
    story), a belated attempt to come to grips with the profound ways in which \"lower\"
    caste-politics has changed the political discourse in the country)..."

  content: "Your point about how there is not much here in the way of a critique of
    the Hindu right (or for that matter the irrelevance of Nehruvian secularism, etc.,)
    is well-taken, though I was careful enough in my wording to suggest subtle.  I
    thought it was present in the depiction of the ambiguous Krishna as widow/wife,
    as well as in the gesture towards the end of the film when the elderly woman sets
    the house alight.  Given the way in which gendered violence has featured as part
    and parcel of rightest forces, it struck me  that there might be something more
    to the structure of Krishna's revenge than simply 'ishq.'  Although, I can see
    why this point did not come out as clearly as I had intended, given my focus on
    the representation of the Muslim vagabonds. The 'as if' space you discuss is precisely
    the shared social of which I made mention---so my point was precisely that it
    was a relief to see that Hindu-Muslim difference were not the essential fault
    lines here.\r\n\r\nAs per your point regarding a some films (Company, etc.,) which
    portray the Muslim gangster-bhai log characters not as anti-India figures, but
    as subterranean non-state actors delivering justice in the absence of justice:
    as you rightly point out, such figures are represented as pro-people but  when
    we turn to films such as Ab Tak Chappan, there is a relentless piling up of corpses
    in the muhallahs and their suggestions to the nefarious connections of Dubai,
    tend to imply that the bhai-log serve communal interests. (Think of Black Friday
    also). (Hmm, then again, I just noticed your caveat here, regarding the issue
    of who is portrayed as the hero)....here, I must admit, I haven't watched enough
    films featuring Muslim gangsters to situate them in relation to complicating the
    jihadi terrorist narrative.\r\n\r\nThe heart and soul of the film, yes, was very
    much in its linguistics/language, the turns of phrase..."

  content: 'Certainly, an "Ab Tak Chappan" is part of that other hallowed B''wood
    tradition, which began as celebrating vigilante/populist violence (against the
    police, state, what-have-you), and has ended up along the "punishment is necessary"
    lines (the line stretches back to the likes of Zanjeer and Deewar, and the problematic
    potential was always latent in films like the former, but it took a change in
    political climate for the true horror of bourgeois "kill ''em all" populism to
    make its way so nakedly to film).  I should note, however, that Ab Tak Chappan
    (or other vigilante encounter cop films, such as Bobby Deol''s Kranti) is, even
    today, a rarer bird than the populist gangster film.  "Black Friday" I would exempt
    entirely from the tradition: it is based on a non-fiction book by veteran journalist
    Hasan Zaidi, and every character is based on fact; that, or the fact that it is
    directed by known progressive Anurag Kashyap does not immunize it from critique,
    but I see its dark pleasures as lying in its refusal to (for the most part) judge.  The
    underworld does receive support from Pakistan in this film (which in itself I
    regard as a completely unproblematic representation: even apart from all that
    has emerged over the last 17 years, through books like Zaidi''s as well as the
    various trials, given that Dawood Ibrahim and more than one of his lieutenants
    lives quite well in Pakistan, it cannot seriously be doubted that one or another
    arm of the Pakistani state was complicit in support for Dawood''s gang; just as
    no-one can doubt -- and certainly the film doesn''t -- that the immediate motivation
    for the terror attacks -- as Tiger Memon says in the film, to exact revenge for
    "our brothers and sisters" -- was thoroughly local) but Kashyap''s paints a world
    where everyone -- police, gangsters -- seems distasteful and violent (the police
    tactics depicted are disturbing enough; one sequence -- showing the sexual assault
    of detainees'' wives/sisters by cops -- didn''t make it past the censors, but
    we are nevertheless left with a clear enough implication of some of the tactics
    used by the men in uniform to make suspects talk); he also explicitly draws a
    link between the communal violence of 1992-93 and the 1993 terrorist attacks in
    Mumbai (the film is prefaced by Gandhi''s "eye for an eye makes everyone blind"
    quote: "Black Friday" is for a world populated by the blind).'

  content: "This is not to suggest that the \"Muslim gangster\" is entirely unproblematic,
    merely that he shares several elements of the folk hero (the jihadi terrorist
    generally features none, although there have been occasional commercial attempts
    to redeem him: most focus on the \"youth led astray\" trope (Fiza; here also militancy
    is a response to communal violence) but the most successful (the utterly mediocre
    Fanaa) featured a terrorist played by a Big Time Hero who never repents, and is
    not given any justification for his cause; the most radical such popular film,
    the superb \"Dil Se\", flopped miserably), and the recent \"Raavan\" by the same
    director, which featured a similarly unrepentant tribal/jungle leader and sinister
    men in uniform, also met the same fate).  If we had to pinpoint a year, I'd pick
    1988, when both the \"threatening other\" and the \"noble warrior\" can be seen
    in the figure of the Muslim gangster (if memory serves me correctly, this year
    featured the birth of the Muslim \"bhai\").  Tezaab's Lotia Pathan is the former
    (the film features a clear Ramayana-inspired sequence when Anil Kapoor's Munna
    and Chunky Pandey's Muslim Hanuman rescure Madhuri's Sita from Lotia's basti),
    while Hathyar's Khan (played by Dharmendra as the most virtuous character in the
    film) is the latter.*  As an aside, I would stress that often people focus on
    Muslim gangsters without accounting for how OTHER groups' gangsters are represented.
    \ I submit that when racked up against the South Indian gangsters of films as
    far removed in time as Agneepath (1990) and Sarkar (2005); or the sinister caste
    Hindu gangsters of Thakshak, Muslims haven't done too badly at all (their cinematic
    ubiquity poses a problem, of course).\r\n\r\n*[As an aside, if you haven't seen
    them, I would pick J.P. Dutta's Rajasthan tetralogy (of sorts) (Ghulami; Yateem;
    Hathyar; Batwara) as among the best popular Hindi films of the 1980s; it's the
    closest Bollywood gets to the epic mode.]"

    add to your point, one thing I have long found distasteful about this sort of
    film (i.e. \"Ab Tak Chappan\" and \"Sarkar\"; not Company) is that the Muslim
    gangster often does not just shoot his people but is depicted as cutting the victim's
    throat, an offensive visual cue to the Muslim-as-butcher stereotype (and perhaps
    a linkage with the sort of jihadi who sacrifices -- as opposed to merely kills
    -- his victims; going to your point about the proximity of the underworld and
    terrorist figures)...where the gangster is the hero, he is never shown doing this
    (this distasteful cue is most striking when one considers that Sarkar and Company
    were directed by the same filmmaker).  And perhaps most galling of all for me
    was \"Maqbool\", a film lauded by far too many liberals, but which infuriated
    me for its depiction of a bhai culture that was steeped in the Urdu tehzeeb of
    \"the North\" -- utterly incongruous to me, and problematic because of its casual
    linkage of one \"sign\" of Muslimness -- the Urdu sub-culture -- with another
    -- the Muslim \"bhai\", as if all such signs could be assimilated to each other.

    I find \"off\" in Maqbool, it was the cultural milieu... I certainly would never
    accuse Bhardwaj of bias or anything like that -- but, in both Omkara and Maqbool,
    I do feel that his \"showiness\" -- his characters seem to me to perform their
    \"native\"/\"ethnic\" background a little too ostentatiously for urban audiences
    (aside: both Maqbool and Omkara only did well in pockets in the major cities)
    -- can be distorting... I actually preferred his Kaminey to both of his previous
    films.\r\n\r\nQuizfan: yes it is the Hindu cop who slits the Muslim gangster's
    throat, but he kills NO ONE ELSE that way; it is the climax of the film, this
    big baddie has called him to Dubai, etc.  Seems to me the film was showing that
    he got what he was perhaps dishing out to others...\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the film is
    based on Daya Nayak, but it didn't address all those other aspects of Nayak's
    life, did it?  The accusations about corruption, that he was on one gangster's
    payroll to knock off people from rival gangs, etc.  In fairness to him I should
    say he was cleared of charges, but I can't help feeling there was more to the
    story.  [Aside: In the B'wood (sort of) mould, I think Vikram Chandra's Sacred

  content: "Re: \"...while Hathyar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Khan (played by Dharmendra
    as the most virtuous character in the film)...\"\r\n\r\nOne clarification: I mis-spoke
    above: the most virtuous characters in Hathyar are the two Gandhian sorts: Dharmendra's
    religious brother (played by Rishi Kapoor), himself the Muslim twin of Sanjay
    Dutt's Rajput father (played by Kulbhushan), who flees his village for Bombay
    rather than stay on and join in the clan warfare.  Dharmendra is the most noble
    and admirable character in the film, but the film surely intends us to regard
    those other two as the more virtuous.  [Given Dutta's great weakness in his other
    films from the period for the myth of the macho Rajputs, it is just as unsurprising
    that Rishi is in a blink-and-you-miss-him part, and Kulbhushan, well, is just
    ineffectual and beset upon by life, ultimately coming to a tragic end.  Dutta's
    heart -- and certainly the pulse of his films' old-fashioned sweep -- belong(s)
    to the warriors.]  \r\n\r\n[Aside: the fact that the ultra-pacifist Muslims in
    films that I can think of (I don't mean kindly folks in general, but people who
    espouse pacifism as an ideology) are both \"pathans\" suggests the continued dim
    resonance of the \"Frontier Gandhi\" paradigm.  The \"noble warrior\" from the
    frontier also crops up from time to time (in Zanjeer (1973); Godfather re-make
    Dharmatma (1975); the period piece, so bad-it's-good Palay Khan (1986) (you mean,
    you DON'T want to see a film where the British general is called Bonz?); Sanam
    Bewafa (1991); Khuda Gawah (1992); and Janasheen (2003); in the last named, this
    is so clearly part of the Firoz Khan self-image it isn't funny)), and is more
    common than the pacifist..."

    as this goes to my point that -- unlike with the jihadi -- the \"robin hood\"
    element does NOT make this an unflattering stereotype in the same way.  Janasheen
    is a variant, but not un-related: this film, produced and directed by Firoz Khan,
    features him as the most Pashtun gangster imaginable; no other director casts
    him this way, and watching the film, it is clear that this is a great phallic
    high for the dude."

    in that way, given that the slit throat is a visual cue with a history (even in
    Hey Ram, a film featuring numerous representations of communal violence, only
    Rani Mukherjee -- raped and killed by her own Muslim tailor -- has her throat
    slit; I have already mentioned the Sarkar example (it stands out there because
    most others are shot in this film)), although I do concede that the script has
    more rationale for it than (e.g.) Sarkar's did.\r\n\r\nRe: \"...for a long time
    the mainstream Hindi film industry did not represent a reality based view of the
    underworld.\"\r\n\r\nPresumably because in the days of \"garibi hatao\" Indira
    Gandhi, the films reserved their ire for smugglers (read: businessmen).  i.e.
    I would argue that there was no \"underworld\" as such in the films of those days,
    you had slimy and wicked business men (hence Davar; but also the villains who
    only had initials for names: JK, et al.) but no \"dons\".  The latter emerge on
    screen in the 1980s, as you point out (Dharmatma is a Godfather rip-off, and is
    not organic in the same way), along with -- and this needs greater attention than
    it has hitherto received -- the political villain (almost always a rapist to boot).
    \ In fact, even more than the \"bhais\", the 1980s are notable for the rapist-politicians
    who seem to be gallivanting across the landscape.  Doubtless, open criminality
    has been on the rise among politicians for decades, but it is surely no great
    stretch to see this as a kind of conservative reaction to the crumbling of the
    \"Congress consensus\"/rise of \"lower\" caste politics, etc.   No-one, it seems,
    is more loathsome than the politician who one feels does not represent one (the
    contrast with the gangster is instructive: as I said, even the worst of these
    will almost never be shown raping, torturing innocent people, and the like; only
    the police and/or politicians will be seen doing that; leading to a more complicated
    portrayal than is acknowledged by some of those who seem to view B'wood only through
    the prism of problematic representations of minorities)."

    called Feroz Khan. The latter was famous in the 1990s for directing the well known
    play <a href=\"http://www.ferozkhan.com/fz_amritasynopsis.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Tumhari
    Amrita'</a> with Shabana Azmi and Farooque Shaikh.\r\n\r\nIndeed. And that showcases
    a kindly old orthodox Muslim loosely based on Haji Mastan. \r\n\r\nYou wrote;
    \"but it is surely no great stretch to see this as a kind of conservative reaction\".
    Actually, there is a far less sinister reason than that. For many years, the censor
    board simply did not allow politicians, government officials or ministers/cops
    to be shown in a bad light. It was even rare for one to see a traffic cop taking
    a bribe. Such instances had to be balanced by a portrayal of a good cop, often
    through the insertion of a non-sequitur character, to pass by the censor board.
    I recall the days in the 1980s when film makers had to fight tooth &amp; nail
    to portray politicians in a negative light.  You may recall how Sanjay Gandhi
    unleashed his goons at Kissa Kursi Ka.\r\n\r\nVijay Tendulkar opened the floodgates
    not with Ardh Satya though. The film that really broke barriers was written by
    him in Marathi and was given the rather obvious title <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmVlfb0khIQ\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">'Simhasan'</a>. It was directed  by the redoubtable Dr. Jabbar
    Patel. \r\n\r\nWhile politicians had been distasteful prior to the 1980s, apart
    from TTK none of the politicians were exposed for graft. It was really the Arun
    Shourie led charge against Antulay that led the floodgates. Then came the terrible
    duo of Devi Lal and his son Chautala. Newstrack and Nalini Singh brought cow belt
    politics into the living rooms of Indians. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't read too much into
    the caste angle."

    formed by various landed upper caste groups to counter Naxal influence; they have
    done this mainly by attacking lower castes and more specifically Dalits not so
    much OBCs. They have been preceded by various other militas like the Kuer Sena
    and Sunlight Sena etc. who were developed to counter-balance increased lower caste
    assertiveness. I also want to add that it is gratuitous to say it is simply about
    grabbing land; what is at stake is basically the autonomy and the ability of the
    landless almost always Dalits to obtain their actually guaranteed rigts like minimum
    wages, share of the crops, practise of untouchability and freedom of harassment
    - especially sexual exploitation of their women. It is the inability of the state
    to guarantee these rights and the obvious unwillingness of the landed castes/classes
    to conceed them that has created the problem and it is hardly a new one - way
    back in the 1970s Karpoori Thakur floated the idea of distributing arms to the
    lower castes in response to the rise of massacres of lower caste villages at the

Babban: How about a joke?<br />
Mushtaq Bhai: Yes, go ahead.<br />
Babban: (nervously) There was once this mullah who had a female parrot. This female parrot had quite a mouth on her, always saying the foulest things. The mullah was at a loss, what to do. He went to his friend, the qazi. The qazi said: look, I have a pair of male parrots, who are both very respectable. They are always singing the praises of Allah. Just have your parrot spend a few days with them, and she&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll be straightened out soon enough. The mullah was very happy by this prospect and handed over his parrot to the qazi. But as soon as the qazi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s parrots took one look at her, they started saying the most vulgar things, suddenly acquiring the most foulest of tongues themselves&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; the worst insults (galis)! I mean&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; things I cannot bring myself to repeat...you see, I am much too embarrassed.

<p>I finally got around to watching Abhishek Chaubey&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much acclaimed debut, a marvel of a film. <em><a href="http://www.ishqiya.com/">Ishqiya</a></em> follows the interconnected stories of a femme fatale named Krishna (Vidya Balan) having just lost her hardened criminal husband, and two thieves, Khalujaan (Naseeruddin Shah) and Babban (Arshad Warsi), on the run. The film&acirc;&euro;&trade;s subtle, yet powerful critique of the Hindu right, its mockery of the rising nouveau rich middle-class; and [relatively] progressive sexual politics, makes it worth a watch. Its landscape is a north India as home through the eyes of its marginalized poor: these happen to include Muslims, (widowed/unattached) women, and lower-castes.</p>
<p>It is to writers&acirc;&euro;&trade; credit that <em>Ishqiya</em>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chief Muslim characters&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;male protagonists aptly portrayed by Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are for once not the Good Muslim-Bad Muslim familiar duo of Bollywood, chasing their tales in a narrative about terrorism (a la <em>Fiza</em>, <em>Mission Kashmir</em>, <em>Dhoka</em>, <em>Fanaa</em>, etc.) I will spare you the history of the much maligned figure of the Muslim in many a film from <em>Roja</em> (1992) onwards, which has pitted the Indian nationalist hero in opposition to the jihadi terrorist. Many recent films, when featuring Muslims, are structured around a popular narrative about a purported crisis unique to Islam&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;between good Muslims working for the success of the secular Indian state, and bad Muslims, taking on the state out of adherence to an aggressively blind religious ideology. Suffice to say, there is rarely a film out of Bollywood these days where the Muslim character is not the bearer of religious particularity or difference or presented as political conundrum. So when a film comes along that doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t fall into the usual scenario, and does well at the box office, it is noticeable.<br />

Khalujaan and Babban of <em>Ishqiya</em> are all too complex and human: vagrants who drink, whore, and thieve their way through rural north India, a pair of comedic, endearing sinners, having universal problems like lack of money, being bullied, homelessness, and dreams of moving on to greener pastures, trying their best to survive in a dog eat dog world.  </p>
<p>The figure of the Muslim in <em>Ishqiya</em> is that of bearing witness and as civilizing persona. </p>
<p>Set in rural UP, the uncle-nephew pair is on the run from rifle toting Mushtaq Bhai whom they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve crossed yet again. Mushtaq Bhai, though bearing no blood relation to Khalujaan, does share a kin relation: his beloved wife is Khalujaan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rakhi sister. The thieves have recourse to pleading with their sister&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;have your husband spare us&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;via a mobile phone whose ringtone is amusingly, Mera Zohrajabeen. <em>Ishqiya</em> is quite self-referential, if not nostalgic, about cinema songs between the 1950s and 1960s, a period when progressive Urdu poets dominated the song-writing scene in Bombay&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a self-referentiality nicely brought to life by Naseeruddin Shah, who represents one of the last Urdu-wallahs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_People%27s_Theatre_Association ">IPTA</a> generation.</p>
<p>After groveling for their lives in a pit dug as their graves, even the cantankerous Mushtaq Bhai has the valor to listen to their last words: a <em>latifa</em> (joke) about corrupting and corruptible parrots, which turns out to be a ruse for the thieves to escape from their graves. Making off with his money, they decide not to kill Mushtaq Bhai&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for the two are often at comedic cross-roads, regarding the question of taking a life.</p>
<p>The theme song in the opening credits is <em>Ibn Batuta</em>, lyrics by Gulzar, and interestingly, a subject of <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Why-credit-for-Ibn-e-Batuta-asks-Gulzar/articleshow/5531149.cms">plagarism controversy </a>. </p>
<p>Ibn Batuta sets the tone of the vagabonds&acirc;&euro;&trade; adventures, referencing the eponymous Muslim traveler, the fourteenth century Moroccan who left behind a detailed rihla (travelogue) of his journeys from North Africa, through Central Asia, and India (where he served in the court of the Delhi sultanate) and to South East Asia. The song&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chorus:</p>
<p><em>Ibn-Batuta, bagal mein juta, pehne to karta hai jhurrr!<br />
Ibn Batuta, carrying his shoes under his arm, when he wears them, they go jhurr!<br />
</em></p>

<p>From the outset, <em>Ishqiya</em> celebrates and humanizes the mobility of its Muslim characters, a refreshing break from depictions of Muslim travel as an inherently threatening, terrifying, and anti-Indian phenomenon. And not just any mobility&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;but mobility of the vagrant, criminal kind&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where Khalujaan and Babban wax nostalgic about farting freely in their village, and make off with stolen cars. Out of favor with most of their family, friend, and criminal networks, Khalujaan and Babban are in search of temporary shelter. The two travelers rapidly find themselves in the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;uncivil&acirc;&euro;&trade; hinterlands: in rural UP, that apparently means being caught in the fray of gun-runners posing as respectable businessmen, and out of control caste wars. </p>
<p>But for anyone who is familiar with Ibn Batuta there appears to be an interesting reversal of a much older theme of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;cosmopolitan travel&acirc;&euro;&trade; at work. The Berber Ibn Batuta was a qazi, and a learned scholar, epitomizing medieval North Africa&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Muslim elite. As Ross Dunn has put it: &ldquo;the Muslim cosmopolite of the fourteenth century [like today&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sophisticated jet-setter] was urbane, well-travelled, and free of the grosser varieties of parochial bigotry&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;and above all possessed a self-consciousness of the entire Dar-ul-Islam as social reality.&rdquo; Khalujaan and Babban are far from urbane elites but the invocation of Ibn Batuta stands in for their vagabond cosmopolitanism. </p>
<p>Incidentally, <em>Ibn Batuta</em> called to my mind that other song about vagabond travel and shoes from Indian cinema (<em>Mera Juta Hai Japani</em>) from Kapoor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <em>Shri 420</em>. In <em>Ishqiya</em>, we have the itinerant stranger heading out of the city and into the village&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;where the village is anything but the space of tranquility and innocence. The lyrical <em>Ibn Batuta</em> of Khalujaan and Babban&acirc;&euro;&trade;s world brings to mind older narratives of Muslim travel, where the sojourner from the cosmopolitan city of origin, is a commentator on the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;un-civil&acirc;&euro;&trade; customs of those whom he comes across: nonetheless he remains part of this larger world. But I digress. Khalujaan and Babban&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cosmopolitanism is expressed in their language: small town Hindi (and Hinglish), the urban slang, and Urdu. Theirs is by no means a provincial world, but they are linked up via mobile phone, and are quite well-traveled, finding shelters and serais from tour guides to train-ticket masters. </p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Untitled2.png" alt="" title="ishqiya2" width="537" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5467" /></p>
<p>The two heroes eventually succeed in securing a place to stay with an old friend, Verma-ji, whose home&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sole occupant now is his wife, the sharp-witted and attractive Krishna. They soon discover that Verma-ji is<em> not</em> coming back. But Krishna has often lived alone: the film&acirc;&euro;&trade;s opening scene portrays her in repose, delighted to see her husband after his long stint away. He brings the gift of a gold chain bearing a pendant of the Taj Mahal, but their reunion is short-lived. Krishna confesses to having gone to the police querying what her husband&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sentence might be if he fesses up, upping the ante in effort to persuade him to surrender; Verma makes a promise to abandon his criminal activities forever. Shortly thereafter, there is an explosion which leaves Krishna widowed.  </p>
<p>The name Krishna is appropriate&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as Vidya Balan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s character conveys the mischievous, clever, seductive, thieving, and much adored Krishna of folklore. Whereas the romantic and chivalrous Khalujaan quickly becomes enamored by her sweet voice and manner, bonding with her over their mutual love of 1950s film songs, the rough and roving Babban is drawn to her unapologetically open sexuality. When Krishna blithely remarks on the stark difference between uncle and nephew: &ldquo;<em>zamin-asman ka fark hai</em> (as different as earth and sky)&rdquo;, Khalujaan corrects her, &ldquo;No, only as different as Hindu and Muslim.&rdquo; The statement shores up the shared social space of these characters negotiated by rituals such as <em>rakhi</em> and by film songs.</p>
<p>Within the first few days of their stay, Khalujaan and Babban discover to their horror that not only has Mushtaq Bhai hunted them down yet again, but the stolen money has disappeared. Their arch nemesis gives them one month (until Rakhi day) to return the stolen money, otherwise, they will be buried alive along with Krishna. </p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Untitled3.png" alt="" title="ishqiya3" width="240" align="left" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5468" />Babban immediately accuses Krishna of stealing the money, though she is quick to point out that while Babban was busy in the brothel, the sweeper Nandu was busy cleaning house. It is Nandu the low-caste teenager who had familiarized Babban with the area, promising to fix his gun: &ldquo;In our village, children learn to use the gun before learning to wipe their butts,&rdquo; Nandu explains that the outskirts of Gorakhpur&acirc;&euro;&trade;s villages are gripped by caste-wars, with a growing Sena army, one that he has just recently joined. </p>
<p>As a friend pointed out to me, the film may be making reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranvir_Sena">Ranvir Sena</a> from Bihar, which had initially developed to harass lower castes, though received comeuppance from the Maoists, and who have been around longer than news reports portray. In the film, however, the Sena is out to seek revenge from a neighboring village of Thakurs. </p>
<p>It is to these caste-wars that the Muslim is witness. When Babban angrily goes in search of Nandu, he accidentally interrupts a meeting, witnessing fiery oration and the distribution of rifles by the Sena army. Cornering Babban, Sena guerrillas threaten him, ordering him never to return to the area, sparing him presumably because he comes with good credentials: a guest of the late Verma-ji. Babban as witness is quite interesting, for if <em>shahid</em>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;martyr&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;means bearing witness, it is worth visiting what the Muslim figure as witness in this narrative implies...</p>
<p>Upon his return, an exasperated Babban explains to Khalujaan that they need to leave immediately:</p>
<p><em>yeh jaga bahut danger hai&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;hamare paas to sirf sunni aur shia ka chalta hai, lekin yahan to har jaat ki apni apni sena hai, khalu! </em></p>
<p>This place is dangerous! We just have Sunni and Shi&acirc;&euro;&trade;a differences, but here, each caste has gotten together his own army, Khalu!</p>
<p>My (not so fully developed) theory: in bearing witness to the caste-war preparations, the Muslim as witness in <em>Ishqiya</em> interrupts widespread narratives of the War on Terror, where the root problem of insurgencies in Muslim countries like Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, is seen to be (political) Islam. In presenting the figure of the Muslim interrupting a caste-war under way, and then commenting upon it, is the filmic narrative implicitly suggesting a  historical, comparative, and regional connection between the sectarian conflagrations of Pakistan, and the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;tribal/low-caste&acirc;&euro;&trade; Maoist insurgencies rocking the red corridor of India?  I am not quite sure how else to read the Muslim (as a minority) bearing witness to organized political violence centered upon &acirc;&euro;&tilde;caste&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;. I do wonder that had the portrayal in Ishqiya been of the Shiv Sena, as an open critique of rightest forces in India, if such an interruption may have been possible.</p>
<p>A debate between uncle and nephew then ensues, as to whether to stay put or go on the run again with Khalujaan saying he can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have it on his conscience that Krishna&acirc;&euro;&trade;s life is at Mushtaq Bhai&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mercy. The debate is put to end by Krishna herself, who tells them at rifle-point that nothing will be decided without her permission, a punishment for fools who have put her life on the line.</p>
<p>It is at this point where Krishna officially hijacks the narrative.</p>
<p>If <em>Ishqiya</em> does not fall into simplistic narrative portrayals about the minoritized Muslim, neither does it fall into some fable about an un-hitched young woman (here, widow) waiting to be rescued. From this point onwards, Krishna does not drive the narrative as a simple object of the two thieves&acirc;&euro;&trade; affection: rather, she is the brains behind a heist carried out by the threesome. Having captured both their hearts, she persuades them into a plan to kidnap a local millionaire and hold him ransom. &acirc;&euro;&tilde;If you throw a stone in Gorakphur, it will land on the head of one millionaire or another,&rdquo; says Krishna, for if rural UP is ridden with caste wars and poverty, then the bustling cotu of Gorakpur is home to a class of the newly moneyed. Krishna has learned her husband&acirc;&euro;&trade;s vocation, having tracked Verma&acirc;&euro;&trade;s exploits, his records, and studied all his cons. She suggests one Kakkar, a local steel tycoon, as their unwitting victim.</p>
<p>For anyone who has watched <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholay"><em>Sholay</em></a> <em>Ishqiya</em>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s widow is a nice rejoinder to the armless Thakur&acirc;&euro;&trade;s chaste and sorrowful daughter-in-law. Recall that Thakur had enlisted two thieves to fight off dacoit Gabbar Singh, but in <em>Ishqiya</em> it is Krishna as widow who has brought in her two guests/admirers for her own independent agenda. When the two thieves first appear at Krishna&acirc;&euro;&trade;s doorstep late in the night, an elderly widow of the village bangs on the door, asking, &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Krishna, people for you. Where are you? Have you gone and burnt yourself up?&rdquo; In these gestures&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;here the implication of <em>sati</em>&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;<em>Ishqiya</em> hints too at a history of politics around the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;woman &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;community - nation&acirc;&euro;&trade; question in India, heating up in the late 1980s, following the <em>sati</em> case of <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/All-accused-in-Roop-Kanwar-case-acquitted/articleshow/467759.cms">Roop Kanwar of Rajastan</a> and the rise of the Hindu right in Indian politics right into the liberalization era. </p>
<p>The link between property and womanhood&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Krishna is seemingly the sole proprietor of the house&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;is a tense one. We see in Krishna the possibility of sexual and intellectual agency, without narrative recourse of turning her either into a kind-hearted, redeemed prostitute who is sacrificed at the end of the narrative, or as someone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wife or betrothed. That is, in <em>Ishqiya</em> there is the refusal to give Krishna an ending in either marriage or death. Nor is there any recourse to making Khalujaan, Babban, and Krishna as part of a narrative of thick religious difference&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;for anyone familiar with the predictability of Hindu-Muslim love stories of Bollywood (a la Bombay, Veer Zara, etc.,). Rather, it depicts the triad of Krishna, Khalujaan and Babban in a space of friendship, love, kinship, and intimacy far beyond the narrow confines of middle-class hetero-normativity and morality and always just beyond the reach of the state: a shared space of marginality in guiding human relationships, and challenging power structures. Indeed Khalujaan, Babban, and Krishna share in the most intimate of political relations: bringing moral retribution to a most sinister Sena leader.  </p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Untitled4.png" alt="" title="ishqiya4" width="335" align="left" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5469" />Towards the end, Khalujaan and Babban feel betrayed, reeling from the discovery that Krishna had stolen their money and hidden it all along, deciding to carry out the operation alone, and interrogating Kakkar about Verma&acirc;&euro;&trade;s whereabouts. Krishna claims that Kakkar is one of Verma&acirc;&euro;&trade;s men and that Verma is still alive. But Khalujaan and Babban do not believe her, since, &ldquo;a woman can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be trusted&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&rdquo;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a statement quickly laid to rest by none other than the low-caste Nandu&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;as the newly initiated Sena member&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;who narrates the truth of her tale. </p>
