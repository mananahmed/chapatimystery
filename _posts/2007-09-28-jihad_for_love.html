  content: I'm not sure "Jihad for Love" is the great hope for queer Muslims we're
    looking for. It's a film made basically for the West. The major problem is in
    the premise - why make a film about queer Muslims in the first place? And the
    name "jihad" evokes only negative connotations in the West and I don't think is
    helpful. Maybe this film will be useful, but I fear it might end up having the
    same impact as Irshad Manji's work, which is to say that it might essentialize
    and pathologize "Islam" (in the broadest use of the term) for being irredeemably
    oppressive.

  content: "Dear Sepoy: Thanks for an excellent post. Please continue to visit
    Huff and also my newly formed blog at www.ajihadforlove.blogspot.com Re: Sahar's
    comment- I invite you all to watch the film and only then form opinion and/or
    judgement about it. To say a film will essentialize or \"pathologize\" 'Islam'
    without seeing it (films being a visual medium) serves no one. Please join
    our mailing list to know when the film is coming to a theater or film festival
    near you. Regards and Salam Parvez"

<p>Parvez Sharma's <a href="http://www.ajihadforlove.com/home.html">A Jihad for Love</a> looks quite promising and I will try and seek it out. It comprises of profiles of various couples from across the Muslim world - such as Ahsan and Qasim: </p>
<blockquote><p>In India, his home country, director Parvez Sharma documents the lives of Ahsan-a Sunni Muslim and Qasim-A Shia Muslim. Both men, coming from poor backgrounds do not adopt western personae of 'gay' and instead rely on local constructs like 'koti' and 'zenana'-used by many men in the Indian sub-continent to self identify around their sexualities. The terms are often also used derogatorily to describe effeminate men but within their own circle of friends they become markers of identity. Ahsan laments the lack of a religious education as he walks the corridors of the Nadhwa Madrassa in Lucknow-an Islamic religious school that is amongst the most prestigious in the Indian sub-continent. Qasim who has faced questions around his sexuality and faith travels with the Director to meet Syed Kalbe Jawad-one of the most prominent clerics and authorities on Shia Islam outside of Iran. This is a meeting that will go to the very heart of the conflict in this film and leave the audience and indeed Qasim, with more questions than answers. Ahsan and Qasim both have found a sense of community within their circle of friends and it is their one moment of celebration and self expression-that finds itself joyously depicted in the film-using the vocabulary of Bollywood cinema-certainly the most familiar vocabulary to a billion Indians. In a remarkable way, the story of Ahsan and Qasim most directly challenges Western notions of sexuality and allows the audience to experience a way of being-and indeed a way of living sexuality, in a way that is different and enlightening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sharma also has a post on <a href="http://ajihadforlove.blogspot.com/2007/09/parvez-sharma-on-huffington-post.html">Ahmedi Nejad's statement regarding the lack of homosexuals in Iran</a> [posted at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/parvez-sharma/ahmadinejad-and-the-homos_b_66209.html">HuffPo</a>]. </p>
<p>To get a glimpse of this living sexuality on the Pakistan side, I recommend looking at two amazing bloggers: <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com">Danial</a>- who has been silent for too long - and the bitingly funny <a href="http://www.venialsin.com/">Sin</a>. For Danial, I recommend reading <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com/?p=303">Goal</a>, <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com/?p=286">Million Dollar Smile</a>, and <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com/?p=127">My First Love Letter</a>. For Sin, you just will have to read his entire archive - or at the very least the <a href="http://www.venialsin.com/?cat=2">Queer Rage</a> category. Sin also owes me a post on Hijras. And he knows it.</p>
<p>You can also check out this old post of mine: <a href="/archives/homistan/eye_on_queer_pakistan.html">Eye on Queer Pakistan</a> - which looks really dated.</p>
<p><b>update:</b> I forgot, duh, to mention that I am greatly impressed by, what I have read so far, Joseph Massad's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Desiring-Arabs-Joseph-Massad/dp/0226509583/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2685547-4078510?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191109682&sr=8-1">Desiring Arabs</a>. I confess that my reading of the book is hampered by the amount of time I can spend in the Sem Coop. Maybe I should just buy the book. In the meantime, looks like Massad is getting good <a href="http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2007/09/26/review_massad_desiring_arabs.html">press</a> in Jordon, too.</p>
