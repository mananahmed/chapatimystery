  content: Well, now I feel really silly - I figured it was some rose drink but Rooh
    Afza totally slipped my mind! Probably a sign that I haven't been back home at
    the height of summer for far too long. Rooh Afza with cold water and lots and
    lots of ice is my mothers favourite summer drink. I find it a bit too rosy in
    taste - and mixed with milk, a bit much too handle.

  content: 'Interesting to see the ratio of the geographic locations in these pics:
    most are from Palestine, Pakistan, Bangladesh, some from India, Indonesia. None
    from the Maghreb (unless Egypt is considered to be classified as such), but boy,
    do the Moroccans know how to celebrate by eating. Ramadan included.'
