<p><strong><em>They're CRAZY about celebrities!</em></strong></p>
<p><a title="Starstruck!" href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2006/10/kimjongil_starstruck.jpg"><img align="left" alt="Starstruck!" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2006/10/kimjongil_starstruck.jpg" width="200"/></a>Dictators can meet <em>any celebrity</em> they want.  They can even <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,929182,00.html">kidnap them and force them to make movies</a> for them while they <a href="http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=899">eat <em>live lobsters</em> with <em>silver chopsticks</em></a>. But that doesn't mean a dictator can't be starstruck.  Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, the notorious <strong>Kim Jong-il</strong> can't believe his good luck: he's standing right next to the beautiful and talented singer <strong>Kim Ryon Ja!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>They LOVE their pressure cookers!</em></strong></p>
<p><a title="Fidel loving his cooker" href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2006/10/castro_lovingthecooker.jpg"><img align="left" alt="Fidel loving his cooker" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2006/10/castro_lovingthecooker.jpg" width="200"/></a>President of Cuba and Comandante of the Cuban military <strong>Fidel Castro</strong> loves to cook with <a href="http://missvickie.com/resources/castro.htm">Chinese pressure cookers</a>! Not only are they <a href="http://www.granma.cu/documento/ingles06/17enero.html">energy-saving</a> for his entire nation, but they really<em> lock in</em> the flavors of meats and vegetables...without boiling out all the nutritional content, like with regular pots and pans! Usually people share cookery tips with their friends and family without expecting everyone to set up their kitchens the way they do, but when you're a dictator, you can command everyone else in your country use your favorite cooking utensils too. It's just like being <strong>Martha Stewart</strong> or <strong>Emeril Lagasse</strong>, only with a whole country, and not just a franchise and a series of trend-setting media appearances.<!--more--></p>

<p><em><strong>They can't keep their minds off HAUTE COUTEUR!</strong></em></p>

Bush</strong> is no stranger to the catwalks of <strong>Fashion Week</strong>. Our Dubya just can't disguise his admiration for right-hand gal Condi's stylish evening duds on the occasion of a state dinner at India's <strong>Rashtrapati Bhavan</strong>. When you're the Emperor of the <strong>Free World</strong>, you can feel <em>free</em> to feast your eyes on all the high fashion you want! No wonder George B. chose the <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/015469.html">finest dressed</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51640-2005Feb24.html?nav=rss_politics">dominatrix</a> in the land to send forth his message of dominion to the <strong>Four Seas</strong>!</p>
