    Your poem ... well read the first letters of the last 8 lines. ;-)

    Amazing how incompetent Pakistan bureaucracy can be! I had forgotten, this incident reminded me.

  content: 'the utter comic genius of the poem itself is nothing compared to that
    of the reading comprehension questions below: "3. Is the author referring to a
    specific person in this poem? If you think so, do you agree that he is a true
    leader?"'

    sepoy: Those who can't, critique. Obviously I can't do better.

    I found a <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:_dNegp5xGi4J:www.fbise.edu.pk/curr/modelpapers/XI/English%20Compulsory.doc Patient and steady with all he must bear fbise&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education model paper</a> with the unexciting "Paraphrase Either of the following stanzas" about a stanza from the poem.

  content: "Excellent!  Earlier I did not consider \"Leader\" important for my
    blog so made no posts. However, your contribution has made it worth to mention.
    I am recycling your poem in a frame next to leader I hope you dont mind because
    bloggin is about recylcing. I think soon our dear General is going to prepare
    a blogger entry exit control list and hand it over to airport personal in Pakistan

<p><img src="/img/poetrydumb.jpg"/><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/pakistan/Story/0,2763,1657964,00.html">Patient and steady with all he must bear</a>, goes the first line of <a href="http://www.rhlschool.com/read8n2.htm">The Leader</a> by <a href="http://www.rhlschool.com/blog/">this</a> gentleman. The poem was picked up by some enterprising English-walla in the <a href="http://nbf.org.pk/">National Book Foundation</a> board [the incoherent motto: "The World's Leading Publishing Organization of Pakistan" certainly doesn't invoke confidence now, does it?] and included in the 11th grade book. And then, someone noticed that the first letters of each verse make "President George W. Bush". Uh Oh. Investigation is underway. So embarassing. Hey, at least it doesn't say Omar and Osama Forever.</p>
<p>Instead of the GWB poem, maybe they will print my sycophantic entry instead, </p>
<div id="blockquoted">Our President Musharraf:</p>
<p><i>Daring to lead from the front,</p>
<p>In a way that makes our enemies grunt,</p>
<p>Can a leader so brave exist?</p>
<p>To make our dear Pakistan persist?</p>
<p>All we have are foes around,</p>
<p>Try hard we must to confound.</p>
<p>Oh! we must look far and wide!</p>
<p>Rest never our weary behind,</p>
<p>Seek inside the Military combine.</p>
<p>Say Praise Be! for he came from the sky</p>
<p>Unusual it is, that Nawaz did not die!</p>
<p>Clear is his vision, true is his letter,</p>
<p>Kargil could hardly have gone any better.</p>
<p>He will make us all Enlightened,</p>
<p>Although it is a task that has frightened,</p>
<p>Rest of our horrid leaders,</p>
<p>Dictatorship is what must free us. </i></div>
<p>See if you crack that code. And if you can do better. Actually, I am sure you can.</p>
