  content: "But there are no Sufi shrines in Brooklyn, so where does the lonesome
    desi with a troubled heart go? Although couched in Islamic epistemologies, i.e.
    the idea of the jinn, such phenomena might have a lot more in common with South
    Asian tantra. You can find similar adverts for tantriks and mystics in almost
    any Indian public space. But the global networks are interesting. And as part
    of the same ideological world as tantra, such \"outsiders\" might have a lot more
    in common with heterogenous Sufism (which moves the center of worship from the
    mosque to what is essentially a graveyard) and other South Asian traditions that
    stress some kind of eclectic ecumenism, and probably do not belong in the same
    class as shrine haters.\r\n\r\nChildren being kidnapped and mutilated? They said
    that about eunuchs in South Asia as well. Who had their own graveyards and networks.
    And who also had to fight a particularly modern onslaught when they were said
    to engage in dubious rituals and belong to networks that bypassed the colonial
    state."

  content: I find it most curious that all the three have Maseeh as the surname. They
    could be related, but more curiously Maseeh is the most common surname for Pakistani
    Christians. Are they Christians then? Extremely doubtful. Too risky a game for
    them to play. Could it be that by hinting at a past non-Muslim association these
    characters make themselves appear as more experienced in black arts? More sinister?
    That helps too in their business.

    practices. Whether they are _actually_ Christian is highly unlikely.'

    to me that the Pakistani media channels have been a few steps ahead of the Indian
    Muslim ones. (With ads for the more Islamic `amils getting more and more elaborate
    in their claims, and eventually giving way to this sort of thing which only seems
    to have appeared in the past two years or so.)"

  content: "I'm Sana From Lahore. I use to work for the Daily News for few years.
    I have been researching Black Magic for few years now and meet hundreds of hundreds
    of people. People have no idea what really black magic is and what are it's effects.
    People who pretend to say they know black magic or they do black magic is a total
    lie. Only 27% of people in the whole world know how to do a really black magic
    and rest of them are just faking it. We muslim have a very low faith in Allah
    or you can say no faith at all, believe in black magic in seconds. After a few
    years of good study and research I also found that, there is a person called \"
    The Guru \" lives somewhere in Pakistan who teaches Spiritual Healing, Power Of
    Chi and Mind Power to 80% of the peer saab in Pakistan. For the last 3 years I
    been try to track this person and was getting no where. 3 months ago I received
    a phone call from a person stating that he wanted to see me regarding the information
    about \" The Guru \". So I called my friends and told them about the call and
    wanted them come with because i didn't wanted to go alone. So finally we got there
    as we were advised. First didn't wanted to believe him because for the last few
    years i been searching for this guy and all of sudden now he is willing to give
    the information about him for free ?. Came to find out that he use to work for
    some famous peer saab just out side from lahore. That Guru use to visit that peer
    saab on a monthly bases, this guy use to be the peer saab assistance and one day
    he decided to leave peer saab and start his own business. He contact \" The Guru
    \" and got refused because \" The Guru \" said that he cannot provide services
    because his Peer Saab is his clients. The information that he provided us, we
    verified it and here it is:\r\n\r\n\" The Guru \" real name is Kamran Khan. Worked
    with many famous names including Criss Angel &amp; David Blane in magic for over
    15 years now. Recently we also discovered that he has a website with name of \"
    Kamran Khan Store \", from where he deals with clients. He travels in most of
    the asia. You have seen the magic show on Star One, Those are also his clients
    including that Franz Guy. If you see this guy he is only 35 Years old and people
    of his double age sits below him because He is there teacher. There is not a single
    Peer Saab specially in Lahore who are not his students. He only stay in Pakistan
    for 15 days and then he travels again.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering all this I was
    shocked to see the result, there are hundreds and thousands of people go these
    Peer Saab every day and spend thousands and thousands of Rupees. All that money
    is really going to the \" The Guru \" Kamran Khan. The more these Peer Saab makes
    the more he makes money.\r\n\r\nSo in other words if you really wanted to see
    a Peer Saab just go the \" The Guru ' it's more cheaper way i guess."

  content: So is kamran khan genuine?

<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/3076973053/">ads</a> were in the magazine section of Pakistan News - an Urdu weekly for diaspora desis in NY, Chicago etc. In breathless prose they invited broken hearts and spirits to have their problem solved within "two and half minutes". One promised a reward if not successful, another lauded his experience of 55 years. In tone, or in content, these ads were apace with any psychic, Dionne Warwick-style salespitch that you may encounter elsewhere. Except for one garish detail - all three ads were explicitly selling services of <i>Kala Jadoo</i>, black magic.</p>
<p>Lost in the noise of "wahhabisation" of the Pakistani publics, are some really interesting changes which accompanied the seasonal migration of Pakistan's labor force to the Gulf since the 1970s. Broadly understood, "wahhabisation" denotes the growth of parties/philosophies in Pakistan who share the stringently narrow-minded Sunni sectarianism from Saudi Arabia, along with some attendant thoughts on anti-imperialism of a local or global kind. Often, the calls for a resurgent Caliphate, or destruction of Israel become &agrave; la carte additions. </p>
<p>But one particularly pernicious long term side-effect of this seasonal migration has been the disruption of the varied local traditions of charismatic and spiritual leadership in Pakistan - specifically the heterogenous sufic traditions. The explicitly "local" site - whether a shrine, a seat or a house of a Sufi - where the community would go for counsel, help, adjudication and spiritual growth was rapidly overwhelmed by a new generation of preachers. This new breed was freely entrepreneurial - tying the remittances to moral panics in the domestic sphere. <i>How do you know if your wife was faithful to you?</i>. The cash-for-salvation business has many, many facets. Clerics like Hafiz Saeed, etc., have done wonders within this 'emerging market'. </p>
<p>The "Black Magic" industry is another, less-frequently mentioned, outpost of this wild capitalism. It operates through a network of intermediaries in the foreign city (be that Doha, Qatar or New York, USA) who identify the marks and get them hooked through a nominal fee. A local payment, in dinars or dollars, gets the troubled soul a special phone number to call. On the other end, is another intermediary who will solicit all your sordid details. The client is usually strung along for months, doing mind-numbing spells and sacrifices and paying small amounts. Eventually, desire and despair forces the client to ask for the ultimate - a direct audience with the 'Amil (Knowledge Bearer). It is perhaps needless to point out that this ultimate round of communications has its own price bracket.</p>
<p>The practitioners use specialized constructions to lure in their clients. They situate themselves, explicitly within the Islamic cosmology, as "outsiders" and mimic a parallel genealogy of filth, as sufis have a genealogy of pure. Alistar Crowley would easily understand. Note that the ads above name the practitioners as either "Massih" or "Bengali" - that is, Christian or Bengal (it has a long history of being associated w/ the darker arts in certain traditions). Additionally, they explicitly name "demonic" beings - some are standard (Kali, Churail, Nag,&Oslash;&not;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Oslash;&sup3;&Ucirc;&rsquo; &Ucirc;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Ugrave;&circ;&Ugrave;&hellip;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&dagger; &Oslash;&OElig;&Uacute;&copy;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Oslash;&ordf;&Oslash;&plusmn;&Ugrave;&frac34;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&bdquo; &Oslash;&OElig;&Oslash;&uml;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Oslash;&plusmn;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&OElig; &Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Uacute;&macr; &Oslash;&macr;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&ordf;&Oslash;&sect; &Oslash;&OElig; &Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ugrave;&circ;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&sect;&Uacute;&dagger;&Ugrave;&hellip;&Oslash;&sect;&Uacute;&lsquo;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Oslash;&OElig; &Uacute;&dagger;&Uacute;&lsquo;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Oslash;&OElig; &Ugrave;&bdquo;&Uacute;&copy;&Oslash;&acute;&Ugrave;&hellip;&Ucirc;&OElig; &Oslash;&macr;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&circ;&Ucirc;&OElig; &Oslash;&OElig; &Uacute;&copy;&Oslash;&sect;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Oslash;&sect; &Uacute;&copy;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&sect; &Oslash;&OElig; &Ugrave;&frac34;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&plusmn;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&ordf;&Ucirc;&OElig; &Oslash;&macr;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Ugrave;&circ;&Ucirc;&OElig; &Oslash;&OElig; &Uacute;&copy;&Ugrave;&bdquo;&Ugrave;&circ;&Oslash;&sup3;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&macr;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Oslash;&OElig; &Ugrave;&frac34;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Uacute;&dagger;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ugrave;&bdquo; &Ugrave;&frac34;&Ucirc;&OElig;&Oslash;&plusmn;&Ucirc;&OElig; &Oslash;&OElig;&Uacute;&circ;&Oslash;&sect;&Oslash;&brvbar;&Ugrave;&dagger; &Oslash;&OElig;&Ucirc;&Oslash;&plusmn; &Oslash;&uml;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ugrave;&dagger;&Uacute;&macr; &Oslash;&cent;&Uacute;&copy;&Uacute;&frac34;&Ugrave;&frac34;&Oslash;&sect; etc.), and some rather inexplicable (Hanuman!).  Graveyards, become the counterpoint to the sufi shrine. Lest we think that this is merely defrauding money from suckers, there are constant reports in the media of child abductions and mutilated corpses being used in <a href="http://www.ansarburney.org/human_trafficking-flesh.html">such rituals</a>. </p>
<p>What to make, then, of these ads which tout their particular other-ness with such aplomb? How do we fit this utilitarian embrace of the Christian and the Hindoo within the same fold as the shrine-hating "wahhabisation"? Theoretically speaking, we have to conceive of a landscapes that accommodates spirituality post modernity. Second, we have to discard the notion of a uniform process of "wahabbisation" (I am tired of putting in the quotes). </p>
<p>Things are way more, um, diabolical. </p>
<p>Below the fold, the actual ads.<br />
