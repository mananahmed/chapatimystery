  content: "Humayun Azad is \"Bamoner Deshe Otikai Manush\" He is the light house
    in this dark village. Probably he came 200 years earlier than his due time. But,
    hopefully, as the days will pass by, certainly this entire dark Bangladesh will
    be enlightened by his lights. He is the Socrates of this contaminated region. Lets
    end with him- \" As long as there will be a single maverick in the world, 
    \ so long the world will be belonged to the people \""

    did not use his merit for the cause of national interest.He was a secoular fundamentalist
    &amp; used to his merit against every religion &amp; culture.He can do many things
    without harm to some one's religious feelings.

  content: The people of BANGLADESH are really hero. As they can do every thing. They
    can murder the father of their nations. They can make a plan to murder their greatest  and
    leading  writer and academic Professor Dr. Humayun Azad. Really they are great
    fool. For BANGLADESH Dr. Humayun Adaz is really a heaven. In Bangladesh only he
    is the man, who wanted the girls living free after BIDDHASAGOR. His "NARRE" and
    "AMAR OBISSHAS" is really a wonderful book in bangla literature.

<p><img src="/img/humayunazad.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>A leading Bangladeshi writer and academic Professor Humayun Azad was <a href="http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_11495.shtml">found dead</a> in his hotel room in Munich, Germany. Prof. Azad was the recent survivor of a brutal <a href="http://www.bangladeshobserveronline.com/new/2004/02/29/editorial.htm">assassination attempt</a> in March. Remarkably, he recovered and was well on his way. He was in Munich to participate in a Bangla writer conference. While the german police thinks a heart attack is the cause of death, his family members are expressing grave doubts in light of continued death threats against him. </p>
<p>Why was Humayun Azad a marked man? A prolific <a href="http://www.sulekha.com/expressions/articledesc.asp?cid=248241">novelist</a>, he shamelessly exposed the religious right in his country for their violence towards women, their hypocrisy in clinging to political power and their fascist programs for the nation. The attack came after the publication of his 2004 book <i>Pak Sar Zamin Sha'ad Ba'ad</i> [Long Live Pakistan] in which the Islamo-militant hero tries to convert Bangladesh into a distorted Pakistan. The hero gets his indoctrination from the writings of Abu'l ala Maududi (founder of the Jama'at-i Islami) and Khomeini (Iran):</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not alone, our brothers all over the world are doing their work. If they fly an airplane into a building somewhere, if some car crashes into a hospital or hotel, or if a bomb blast kills 300 people in some recreational centre, then we know it's the work of our brothers; in other words, it is our work. This is Jihad."</p></blockquote>
<p>The protagonist, though, has a change of heart after he falls in love with a <b>Hindu</b> woman and abandons his ways. In earlier novels, Azad called for women's sexual revolution, for re-distribution of land. </p>
<p>The Islamic jihadists in Bangladesh could not win in the jihad of ideas so, they revert to what they know best: terror. </p>
<p>May Azad's novels and his legacy produce millions of new independent, contrarian, thinkers and actors.</p>
