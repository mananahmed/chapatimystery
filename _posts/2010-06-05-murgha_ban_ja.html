  content: Wait, I thought he was being punished for not moving away from the beach
    as the cyclone approached.  then why is this punishment taking place on...the
    beach?  And his poor rickshaw...!

  content: Saadia has it right. But that's if he really is the rickshaw-wallah. His
    physique, attire and general obsequiousness suggests he might not be. No rickshaw
    wallah will become a <i>murga</i> just like that, not when he knows he can feed
    the <i>tulla</i> his <i>rishwat</i> and get away. Plus nobody washes their rickshaw
    in the sea surf, leave alone in the wake of a cyclone.

  content: "Bygone era? Don't think so, as the photo shows. You cannot write time
    away so easily and send it into history so soon. \r\n1. Cyclone Phet is so ' just
    yesterday'.\r\n2. Murgha pose is still being imposed.\r\n How shameful and derogatory
    it is to make someone go through this as punishment.\r\nThe comment by another
    reader about the small girl, omigod. I hate this. Don't know what other tortures
    she may have undergone .\r\nGood photo, unusual, the whole picture, especially
    as it makes one think."

  content: "Rani Narayanan - \"Years back my neighbor, a girl aged 16 who was married
    to a man aged 40, (Biharis) ran into her house when she saw him coming home at
    a distance. She didn't know other languages except Hindi and Bihari; I then didn't
    know either. My another friend was actually translating me this. On running into
    the house she said, if he found her talking to us he would say \"murghi ban\"
    I couldn't imagine what it was. Seeing this I now feel so bad, that the girl should
    not have gone through this punishment from the old husband!!!!!!. :(Jun 7)\"\r\n\r\nSorry,
    this was the comment. It was on my buzz page, I came to this site through a link."

<p>*The punishment is called "Murgha bana na" (to make one into a rooster). One is to grab the ears from behind the legs (<a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060505/img/05curfew.jpg">not like this</a>). Uncomfortable! And quite popular in schools across South Asia as well as in other settings. The gentleman above, holding the Murgha pose, was washing his rickshaw in the surf as the cyclone Phet approached and people were ordered away from the beaches. This is the best photo, representing a bygone age, that I have seen. A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjrzluUi9y0">policeman with a lathi</a> and not a klashnikov. Sigh.</p>
