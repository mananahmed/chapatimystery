    easy. and then another person told me the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nAll palmists and
    swamis who have read my janmakshar/janampatri (horoscope book) have told me that
    I'll always have a very difficult life, and money and material security will be
    constant sources of anxiety. \r\n\r\nThat much is true.\r\n\r\nThey also told
    me that anything I do will involve travel.\r\n\r\nAnd that is true.\r\n\r\nThey
    went on to say that when I'm 28 years old, I'll be noticed/recognized for something.\r\n\r\nThat
    didn't happen. I just jumped over the 29 mark. Bunch of liars.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of the Himalayas, aren't they lovely? Here in Nepal, you can't see them at all
    because of the haze and dust-- in fact, you can't even see the hills surrounding
    Kathmandu. But everyone says that post-monsoon, you can see them and they feel
    very close to you."

  content: "clanking silence makes perfect sense.  \r\n\r\nand dk, asad, I'm with
    you.  Not that I'm likely to be able to afford a ticket, or get that pesky Iranian
    visa, but what a dream journey. \r\n\r\nAnd seductive/hopeful, yes, but I think
    night trains also  carry an air of potential menace--that's possibly even part
    of the appeal."

<p>a long long time ago, a palmist told me that everything in my life will be hard, but i will achieve whatever it is that I wanted. just nothing will come easy. and then another person told me the same thing. No wonder I used to day dream about being a station manager of a railway station that was  the last stop of a train into the himalayas.</p>
<p>that would be the easy life that i can never have. </p>
<p>in my day dream, i had two rooms in the railway station. and here, i do not embellish my young self. one room would be filled with books. the other room would be filled with mangos.</p>
<p>during that phase, i would often sneak out of the house at night. and hop trains. i know, it was dangerous and insane. but i was in thrall with the sound of the train as it rolls over the gap in the rail.<br />
and the night.</p>
<p>i wanted that clanking silence.</p>
<p>if that makes any sense.</p>
