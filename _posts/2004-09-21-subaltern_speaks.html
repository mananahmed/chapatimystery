    This is false advertisement. Your previous post promised us the journal of a subaltern in 1857 but the one you have started is from the Anglo-Sikh war. I am just kidding. This should be very interesting as well.

    BTW, can we have some background of the subaltern himself?

  content: 'Zack: This journal comes before the 1857 one. We always have to look further
    back. The subaltern is anonymous. But I dug some stuff up and will annotate it
    as we roll along.'

    <strong>Anglo-Sikh War Journal</strong>

    Sepoy of Chapati Mystery has started posting the journal of an anonymous subaltern from the second Anglo-Sikh war in the Punjab in 1848-49. It should be interesting reading. Some historical background is available here. Sepoy promises another journal f...

<p>Well, four out of five readers wanted the subaltern journal.<br />
here it <a href="/subaltern/index.php">is</a>. This is just the five minute WP install - so expect bells and whistles later. And "folly of trusting newly raised troops" line got to me. hmmmm...this funny thing called history.</p>
<p>From the introduction June 16, 1849:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">The following pages have already appeared in the <i>Times</i> newspaper, and are now presented more at large, and in separate form, in compliance with the wishes of some, who had read them with interest.<br />
