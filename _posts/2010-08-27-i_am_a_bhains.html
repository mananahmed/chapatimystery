  content: Funny, my search for Daniyal turned up this one. I think you are nit-picking
    here, the particular way he chose to narrate it starting with a cow startled me
    as well, but he turns around the story, how a family depended on that cow, and
    the lives ruined by the death of a cow - it is not fair to undermine the overwhelming
    sentiment in Daniyal's op-ed which is that it is a human tragedy beyond all. There
    is a little bit of the western prism when he talks about how extremism could play
    into this, but to be fair, even from a pakistani standpoint, this should be a
    concern.

  content: "I agree with Najeeb. \r\nOnly a farmer knows the tragedy of losing livestock.
    \ I've see them weeping inconsolably at the loss of \"cows\" and what setback
    it gives. I read a news story where the army people were trying to save four men
    on the rooftop of a school. Two men refused to be rescued because they couldn't
    take their cattle as well and decided to stay back and guard it. Many people would
    think they were just plain dumb for not realising the importance of just a \"bhains\".
    But it is their reality where the option of potential death is bearable than the
    certainty of losing their source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nJust because Daniyal decided
    to start off with that sentiment doesn't mean he is undermining the human tragedy.
    He's just giving another perspective of a human tragedy which people can (and
    are) very easily looking past."

<p>I am a <em> bhains</em>. I am now dead.</p>
<p>You must have read, recently, a particularly elegiac treatment of the last moments of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/opinion/19mueenuddin.html">a prostrate brown-and-white brindled cow</a> in your favorite newspaper. I didn't read it, but I was told about it. Cow? I said to myself. Cow? We are talking about southern Punjab, yes? Sure there are cows here, but to use a cow as a crassly evocative narrative device seems akin to highlighting the Vespa scooter, when the Honda Hero is really the star of the show! </p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/08/article-1301925-0AC0103A000005DC-23_634x436.jpg" alt="" title="cow" width="554"  class="size-full wp-image-5632" /></p>
<p>I mean, come on, I am here. Me. Use Me. Punjab is unexplainable, unknowable, unthinkable without Me. Speak about me, think about me, hear my voice. ((I can see you rolling your eyes. <em>I can't actually see you.</em> Oh, how Pamukian, your sensible selves are noting. You know what, <em>My Name is Red</em> can go ma'an chudao itself. I won't apologize for my crassness, since I am an unabashed Punjabi bull.))</p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/08/1100915455-1.jpg" alt="" title="bhains kay aagay been bajana" width="554" class="size-full wp-image-5630" /></p>
<p>You may have heard of me. They routinely say:<em> 'aql bari kay bhains</em>. Am I right? What an insult. Of course, I am bigger than "intelligence". But these city-folks who can only see me as a street nuisance, while they sip on the delicious milk I provide, are so very keen to make up insulting <em>proverbs</em> about me. Or you may have heard, <em>jis ki lathi uss ki bhains</em>. Another insult. Just because someone has a stick, I do not become his possession. I do have a functioning brain! I do recognize, know and love my owner. The most insulting, however, is, <em>bhains kay aagay been bajana</em>. Insulting for the sad, pathetic human, of course. I am not sure why they think I am immune to the charms of a good tune on the flute. I love music.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-27-at-10.21.52-AM.png" alt="" title="Breeds of Water Buffalo in Punjab" width="554" class="size-full wp-image-5633" /></p>
<p>Or you may heard of mine genetic cousins in Kenya or Indonesia or wherever the Montgomery Breeding Techniques took my breed (we work well in tropical heat, they concluded)? Or maybe you heard of my cousins, Murrah, Kundhi, Nili, Ravi, here in desh?</p>
<p>Oh, I know. You don't care about me. It is that farmer standing next to my dead carcass that interests you more, isn't it? You think that now that his life is ruined by this flood, his cattle is dead, his land is covered in waist high mud and soil, his crops are ruined, his body is racked with dysentery and cholera, he will become a Taliban and attack America. Yes. That is who you really want to hear about. Sadly, even though I have a voice (beyond the carcass, even!), he doesn't. He needs someone else to speak for him. Someone with a more evocative touch than his illiterate, agrarian yet highly combustible brain can possibly produce. </p>
<p>I hear you. You are a hammer and every thing else is a nail. More precisely, every Pakistani is a infected with HIT-virus - full blown disease is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>What is the point then? I cannot tell you anything that can change your mind. He is poor. <em>He is easily bought by Wahabi or Opium money.</em> He works hard for his meager food. <em>He will swallow whole the dialectic of revolution or of Khilafa.</em> He is traditional in his outlook, in his customs. <em>He is a fundamentalist and a sectarian</em>. He spent some time in the Gulf doing labor. <em>He was indoctrinated with Wahabi ideology.</em> He can recite Bulleh Shah or listen to the Heer for days. <em>He what?</em> He is a human being with a past, a present, a culture, a society, a vision of the good life, a sense of community, a method of belonging, a routine of daily practices, a collection of stories for his children, a corpus of songs for his friends, a set of possessions, a love for radio or tv, a daily grind and an early night. <em>He is waiting to attack us in New York. </em></p>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2010/08/ss-100731-pflood-08.ss_full-1024x625.jpg" alt="" title="Surrounded" width="554" class="size-large wp-image-5638" /></p>
<p>You see his suffering through your security, your strategy, your politics. You don't see him as a human. Just as you don't see me as more than cattle. You don't know who he is, so he must be your worst nightmare. If you saw him as human, if you granted him agency, thought, you wouldn't be so afraid. You would want to help him. Not because he might become Taliban, but because he is your kind, and he needs your help. </p>
