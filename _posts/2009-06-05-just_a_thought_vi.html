  content: "Steve Walt: \"That's my second concern: does it
    make strategic sense to displace upwards of three million people in order to go
    after around four thousand Taliban, most of whom aren't \"global terrorists\"
    in the same way that al Qaeda is? The Pakistani army has reported only light losses
    thus far, which suggests they aren't risking their own soldiers
    in careful counter-insurgency operations but are relying instead on firepower
    and other indiscriminate tactics (which helps explain why people are fleeing in
    such large numbers and could be why the region has been off-limits to reporters).
    If the operation has left a lot of destruction in its wake, as seems likely, will
    it make the government or the Taliban more popular in the long run? And given
    that we helped egg the Pakistani government into this, are we likely to get blamed
    for it down the road?\" http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/06/01/taking_it_to_the_taliban
      \"The inability to cope with a crisis caused by its own military action
    means that Pakistan's government is ceding influence to others (radical groups
    in particular) that are quick to fill the vacuum\" http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/pakistan-s-war-on-civilians  \"Every
    time the army drops a bomb or fires a bullet in the north-west it is in danger
    of stirring up resentment among some civilians which will create new enemies in
    future years.  The militants in Swat may well lose the battle over the coming
    days and the future of Baitullah Mehsud appears increasingly uncertain. But unless
    the Pakistani government - and indirectly the international community - changes
    its tactics, the Taliban can still win the war. \" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8078947.stm"

  content: USA is responsible for up to a million Iraqi deaths since the invasion.
    And after a few tough years, it seems things have quieted down. So....maybe you're
    blowing this whole "You create new terrorists by bombing people" theory out of
    proportion.  When you bomb people, alot of the times they just take it and go
    somewhere else.  If people by nature would spring up and become violent militants
    because they were harmed by the government or other entities, then pakistan wouldnt
    still have a feudal system.  Those serfs would have rised up.

  content: "In \"Children of the Taliban\" Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy interviewed a few
    IDPs; one child relates the story of his 13 year old cousin who was killed in
    a US/Pak  missile strike on a madrassa, and how he witnessed his body being \"eaten
    by dogs.\" The kid said he wanted to become a Taliban fighter when he grows up.
    \   The tribes people might've seen a lot of brutality at the hands of the
    Taliban militants, but on some level they can still \"relate\" to them, they're
    the same people, and negotiations can be made where the two can live side by side,
    even. But the Pak army is perceived as more of a \"foreigner\", and the blind
    BANG with which they conduct their operations, and the mess they leave, makes
    them more loathsome to locals (generally speaking.)   So it's not too farfetched
    to imagine that the people displaced by military operations, deeply affected by
    where it's left them, with no livelihood and with little hope of help from the
    government... WILL be receptive to the beard brigade."

    men under the black-and-white flags at the traffic circle will find a receptive
    audience for their message.</i>  Visitors and Hosts in Pakistan by Kathy
    Kelly, June 10, 2009   \"I asked my friend how families cope when a bomb
    suddenly blasts their home in the middle of the night. Do they have any kind of
    first aid available to help the wounded? \"You see this,\" he said, pointing to
    the long shawl that I happened to be wearing, a customary part of every village
    woman's dress, \"they try to use this [as a bandage], because
    it is all they have.\" I imagined the shawl rapidly soaking up the blood of a
    dying Pakistani man, woman, or child.   On the morning of the 20th, the
    other villagers had rushed to the section where the missile had hit, hoisting
    injured survivors onto their shoulders and carrying them across rough, hilly terrain
    to the nearest road (about three miles away from the village) where, lacking vehicles
    of their own and with no hope of receiving an ambulance visit, they waited for
    a car to stop, their only means of reaching a hospital.   The first car
    they saw did stop, but its driver refused to take any of the wounded for fear
    that his action would be noted by an unmanned U.S. drone, and that he himself
    would face the same reward for his hospitality that the village had received.
      The villagers walked along the road until another car stopped and did
    agree to take some of the wounded to a nearby center run by the International
    Commission of the Red Cross.\"  http://original.antiwar.com/kelly/2009/06/09/visitors-and-hosts-in-pakistan/"

    piece allegedly aimed at quelling fears and demystifying TAlIBOTHRA, makes TALIBOTHRA
    seem like some sort of weird psychological phenomenon. Rejects the 60-mile-from-Islamabad
    thesis as hyperbole (which is a moot point now), yet raises the specter of Nuclear
    terrorism and the mysterious virus of \"Talibanization.\"  Either way, if \"the
    real threat sn't the Taliban occupying urban territory. It's their ability to
    attract followers \", then how would a massive military action help?   \"At
    an upscale coffee shop in Islamabad, the 20-something reaches for his cellphone
    and pulls up a photo of a young man with a Taliban beard.\"  - What's a

<blockquote><p>Refugees are easily radicalized, and if the Pakistani army, which carries out counterinsurgency with a bludgeon, continues to create thousands of new ones, with no government plan for their return to Swat and the reconstruction of their homes, it's quite possible that the long-bearded men under the black-and-white flags at the traffic circle will find a receptive audience for their message.</p></blockquote>
