  content: "Very nice essay. I wonder about \"The idea of singular history, whether
    championed by State, or Right, cannot bear such scholarly scrutiny. The historians
    privileged by the State make a point to ignore such multitudes.\" Though there
    are voices like Ramanjuan off and on, there seems to an ancient antiscientific
    attitude from some text communities. In a discussion on Bronkhorst's article Panini
    and Euclid, Aravindhan suggests (http://www.mayyam.com/talk/showthread.php?1868-Ancient-Indian-scientific-Heritage/page3&amp;highlight=bronkhorst)
    that this already started by Panini's time : \"Panini's grammar, from a methodological
    perspective, embodies two trends. The first is the trend towards the primacy of
    exegesis in scholarly discourse. For some reason, texts by renowned scholars came
    to have a very special status, eventually becoming a source of knowledge equal
    to or superior than observation. The second trend is the increasing importance
    of inductive reasoning, where you used specific examples to derive generalised
    rules. Taken together, these are capable of producing devastating errors.  But
    Panini's grammar did not create these trends, nor were they confined to grammatics.
    You find them equally in philosophical works of the period which - unlike earlier
    texts - only try to interpret, expound on and clarify the meanings of existing
    texts; and even the original work that is done still seeks support in interpretation
    of existing texts.  We see exactly the same disease in the mathematics of
    the period. Bhaskara tries to argue mathematics using rules of mimamsa. Mimamsa,
    for heaven's sake! And proofs - where they are provided - tend to be anecdotal,
    rather than deductive. Bronkhorst argues that philosophy in that period understood
    the concept of proof. He's right, technically speaking, but the form of proofs
    they used lacked rigour and routinely accepted exegetic and anectdotal evidence
    as \"proof\". Just as the mathematicians did.\" Going through some of the articles
    on Indian astronomy in 'Sanskrit Knowledge Systems' (http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pollock/sks/)
    I find a tendency among Indian astronomers, right up to nineteenth century, to
    fit new observations in to puananic accounts of the world. Perhaps it is not just
    state but text communities with strong beliefs started this trend long ago."

  content: "Thanks for the link to the piece in 'Caravan.' And yes, that thematic
    link between &ldquo;Elements of Composition&rdquo; and
    the Ramayana essay is remarkable and precisely what I was also talking about in
    my comment on your earlier piece on Ramanujan.  AKR has other Kannada poems too
    that do related, similar things with the image of composition/ decomposition.
    The beauty is how well and seamlessly all the elements of his writings in various
    genres (and languages) connect with each other."

<p>I have a piece on Ramanujan's essay and the DU controversy in The Caravan, <a href="http://caravanmagazine.in/Story/1168/All-the-Myriad-Ways.html">All the Myriad Ways</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's no surprise, then, that so consistently we receive a singular history of the State, a composite account that tells an overwhelmingly familiar arc of progress towards the very moment in which you&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the school child, the dutiful citizen&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;happen to be reading and accepting that history. That the United States is a melting pot, or that India contains multitudes is itself a monolithic and singular account.</p>
<p>We, for whom the history of the State is a familiar battleground; we, who grew up in dictatorships, for whom history was the first and most potent weapon for warfare, know this intimately. In Pakistan, there is no multitude of narratives when it comes to our pasts. In Islam, there are no voices that interpret scripture in divergent ways. Notions like these are quickly labelled heretical and such voices are shunted off to the mortuary. Notice the fate of Punjab's governor, Salmaan Taseer, who dared to imagine a Constitution that might include another voice, admit to another living diversity.
