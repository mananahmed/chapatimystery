  content: Interesting stuff. I was a little surprised that the second one was as
    ambiguous as it is; or, to put it another way, without your introduction, I would
    not have been at all certain who was being lionized and who deprecated until very
    late -- the Rambo/Top Gun references in the last two minutes kind of give it away,
    though there's still a more documentary, less moralistic tone than I expected.

  content: Even the musicians who come off badly in the clip are at the mercies of
    what looks like some pretty shifty editing (and, as you said, responding to loaded,
    bullying questions apparently premised on the notion that anyone who doesn't share
    the reporter's perspective is de facto dishonest).   The portrayal of 'Yeh Hum
    Naheen' was particularly odd.  Anyway, someone needs to send the dude some Laal
    tracks, and a reminder that political song in Pakistan involves a lot more than
    just "singing out against the United States."

    The last three really only have a niche market in the urban elite whereas Abrar
    truly is a pop artist.   That said, it really was disappointing to hear
    Ali Noor and Azmat say those things. It's hard enough to see artists like them,
    with so little originality become so popular with our apish urban youth. Our art
    really can and should have more indigenous references, symbols and notes than
    these people would have us believe."

  content: "There is no doubt some shoddy editing in the video... Ali Azmat was part
    of Junoon for over a decade, and nobody can accuse Junoon of being quiet about
    this problem... they could easily have gone to Salman Ahmed, Ali Azmat's bandmate
    in Junoon... he may be ruining his legacy by trying to actually sing instead of
    playing guitar, but he is quite articulate and his \"Rockstar and the Mullah\",
    despite all its faults, talks about these things quite explicitly:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIKQfGahBf4
      Shehzad Roy's two songs are in fact from the same album...  The
    Co-VEN song, presented as \"proof\" of the narrator's arguments, is actually a
    terrific, raw, warning that the militants \"have multiplied\":  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml4OG0n5WnA  Co-VEN
    and a few other underground bands also played benefit concerts for the Swat IDPs...
      There is no mention of Laal, whose songs denounce \"Mullah Raj\"...  \"Sajid
    and Zeeshan\", friends of Fasi Zaka and proteges of Nadeem Farooq Paracha, would
    have been vocal in their condemnation of the terrorists, given how they are from
    Peshawar and badly hit by this... the same goes for \"Zeb and Haniya\"...   Also
    missing were the Christians who are a part and parcel of our rock scene... Gumby,
    Shallum and the like have in the past been clear in their criticism...  **  However,
    we must pause to wonder why some of these stars have bought into these conspiracy
    theories... take Ali Noor for instance... editing or not, who in their right minds
    can claim that terrorism is the smallest problem Pakistan faces, and that it is
    only the West that opposes the militants... how insulting to the memory of all
    those who die daily in our streets...   Ali Azmat is the saddest case of
    the lot... he used to boast about how he beat up two Jamaati thugs who once came
    to beat him up... a notorious womanizer and alcoholic in his very recent past,
    he now shares the stage with Maulvi Zaid Hamid and the two have on occasion invited
    Maulvi Imran Khan along too...   I hate to bring sect into this, but it
    is shocking that the Shia and Ismaili stars, whose communities can be expected
    to be at the top of the militant hit-list, are so ambivalent about this threat...
    Ali Azmat, Ali Noor and Ali Hamza are Shia and Shehzad Roy is Ismaili..."

    the electronic media matters like never before in Pakistan... during the Swat
    operation, they were able to mold opinion in favor of the army and against the
    terrorists in a way that would never have been possible in the old PTV days...
    if there is any silver lining in their coverage of the recent carnage in our cities,
    it is that they are still anti-Taliban, even if some of them do insist that Hakimullah
    Mehsud is living in luxury at Bagram and the \"funds\" are coming from the infamous

  content: "I'm not a fan of Paracha, but he has a point about
    Zion Hamid.  Fasi Zaka on Hamid: \"The whole body of work that Zaid Hamid
    has on television is derived from opportunistic amalgamation of facts to create
    conspiracy theories. One look at him on screen, and one can easily believe he
    is sincere, which I am sure he is. A handsome man in the vein of Che, he professes
    to bring out the truth that the mainstream media ignores, and says himself that
    he brings it out at some personal risk by battling the powers that be. Whenever
    a question is posed at him he goes into an erudite, but factually questionable,
    explanation of the answer without pausing, giving an air authenticity by not harbouring
    doubts. But the gist of most of it is a belief that what has happened to us collectively
    in our underdevelopment is at the hands of evil non-Muslims, traitors in Pakistan
    and the trio of the CIA, RAW and Mossad.\"  The Pakistan report card 12-June-2008 http://www.thenews.com.pk/editorial_detail.asp?id=136405
      The man is a fiery orator. He is an entertaining character, his engrossing
    narrative is built on some facts and some known conspiracy theories (Protocols,
    Amero etc.), emptying politics of politics resulting in all politics/conflicts/events
    being explained in terms of a reductive essentialist theory (the nefarious designs
    of the Free Masons, Jews and Zionists, and Hindus/\"Banya\" are in unison with
    one another).  I'm more cynical of his theories in retrospect
    than I was while viewing his program and for a while Zaid Hamid's programs did
    hold my attention. But then the ever broadening scope of the conspiracy theories
    turning into an entire worldview, got to be too much to bear for the sake of entertainment
    or acquiring information that I didn't have (like Ford being
    an anti-Semite portrayed in Zion Hamid;s narrative as a brave person who was on
    to the evil cabal). To a lay man who has at best a tenuous grasp of history, Zion
    Hamid's narrative and style might have enough of a hook. He
    talks about famous historic Muslim military men and while narrating his stories
    about these men, he rocks back and forth in reverence as if in a trance. In a
    growing cacophony of &ldquo;What went wrong?&rdquo; his
    internally coherent narrative does attempt at resurrecting some pride in his audience.
    But then the &ldquo;Us vs. them&rdquo; paradigm, prejudice
    &amp; crass racism, bad analysis and a sort of anti-intellectualism that he offers
    is too big of a price to pay. No need to understand what Zionism is, or what is
    or what is going on in the occupied territories, or Israel, or the U.S, or India.
    Why bother when you know that &ldquo;they&rdquo; are doing
    this because &ldquo;they&rdquo; are evil by nature or are
    under the grip of an evil ideology i.e. Zionism/free masonry/Hindu Zionism or
    whatever.   In one of his programs, he said something to the tune of Muhammad
    Bin Qasim and his companions were thought of as devtas by the Indian population.
    I watched his \"Hindu-Zionism\" program but still don't know how he defined this
    neologism. May be it was supposed to be self-explanatory, but I'm
    not smart enough to understand it. Other ZaidHamidisms include: Hindus are a \"paleet\"
    Qom of \"Banyas\", Indian state is expansionist by nature and is in pursuit of
    Akhand Bharat (as if Pakistan or any other state is not expansionist/hegemonic),
    and Indian State is overly heavy-handed in dealing with rebellion and insurgencies
    (Never mind Pakistan's handling of Baluchistan, East Pakistan, or Swat).  His
    most humorous moment was denying that the Mumbai attackers were not Pakistani
    because &ldquo;their faces are not like Pakistani's
    faces, and they were wearing wristbands that Hindu Zionists wear.&rdquo;
    I was on the floor laughing.   Oh, and he also rants about how Indian military
    strategists fervently and ardently follow Chanakya. Every twist and turn in his
    narrative of post-partition Indian history is explained away with a reference
    to what Chanakya said, and soon enough it becomes Chanakya also said such and
    such, and look this is what India is doing. So if you want to understand &ldquo;India's
    next move&rdquo;, read Chanakya. It is akin to the textbook ploy of
    Islamophobe, who reduces history/current affairs to what he thinks Quran/Hadith/Ghazali/IbnTaymiyyah/SyedQutb
    &ldquo;says&rdquo; or doesn't say. Paracha,
    himself, might know a thing or two about that."

    fan following about the misleading information...  Also, once when pressed

<p>In a (somewhat cringe-inducing*) <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/tuning-out-the-taliban-in-pakistan-pop/">video report</a> at NYT, Adam B. Ellick takes aim at some of the very popular Pakistani pop stars and their lack of attention to the Taliban. </p>
<p>Not that we could tell much about US campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Af-Pak since 2001 ("Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" anyone?) from US pop registers, it is still an illuminating look at what a *certain* segment of youth is consuming. </p>
<p>Here, for Mr. Ellick, are couple of recent anti-suicide bombing/Taliban songs. You may not understand the punjabi/urdu but you can easily follow the visual story. Both of these singers are just as popular, if not more, than Ali Azmat or Shehzad Roy featured in the NYT report. </p>
<p>Abrar ul-Haq, <em>Awain Na Kar Zulm</em> (Do not do such tyranny) </p>
<p><object width="580" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0hqUZpFwn54&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0hqUZpFwn54&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="360"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>What heaven after you blow up heaven? What heaven after you kill children? What are these lures of virgins? These are victims of conspiracies. Where will you hide from God?</em></p>
<p>And here is Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, the nephew of maestro Nusrat, <em>Khuda Zamin say giya nahiN hai</em> (God has not left this world). This is the title song of a new PTV serial which does shine forth in all patriotic glory. But still.</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/q7EqPFf1vvU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/q7EqPFf1vvU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p>* to be explicit, Ellick narrates this with more than a modicum of sneer as to why Pakistani rockers are singing of extraneous issues like "meddling America" or "torture at Gitmo" or "corruption or poverty" or "drone attacks"instead of, you know, "Taliban". Sure the Noori kids are idiotic. But what exactly is his point in "Would you sing a song about Taliban blowing up schools?" or "the words don't even mention 'taliban' or 'terrorism'". Is this a reality that is somehow missing from Pakistan? Obviously not, since he does show news and views channels expressly against them. </p>
