    Piracy seems to be natural response of the market when there is a difference between its stated price and its percieved value. Insane pricing policies make criminals out of millions of otherwise normally law abiding citizens.

    Malaysia tried a very interesting policy: placing price ceilings on CD prices and simultaneously pursuing pirates. Controversial, but I think a practical approach.

    Once any kind of industry is driven underground due to silly pricing policies or laws, it breeds all kinds of associated ills; including organised crime and terrorist funding.

  content: money for everything- this world is an evil place. i think musicians, artist
    etc should be paid from a large universal fund...no royalties no disgusting amounts
    of cash but a nice fat salary for them all...communism modified. i mean they have
    the talent and deserve reward..but everyone has a right to entertainment. free
    music rocks...would i pay for it- yes. CAn i pay for it- no. on a personal level
    i'd have to say that i support the industry as one of our own.

  content: 'I always thought, CHina or HongK/Malaysia/Singapore were at the top, as
    we normally get all those latest installers compiled in one of these countries.Personally
    i''m in favor of these pirated softwares (only softwares),as its the only way
    to break the monopoly of microsoft and many other countries who dont realize that
    millions in developing countries simply cant afford them ; but they need them
    too!! BADLY!! e.g Any WinOS''s here in denmark would cost almost 75% of your Room
    rent!!(hostel)this is insane!! [later on i joined the OSSEP: (organized-student-software-exchange-program)]
    so just think about what if someone inpakistan would have to pay like 10,000Rs
    to get a licensed OS copy!! how many can actually  save that amount of money?..Moving
    the production facility into the region is not a solution;  especially in our
    case: they have tried it before and there was no major effect onthe price list
    due to ten thousand types of taxes!! Similar is the case when it comes to scientific
    softwares, some universities don''t have that much budget to get all those licensed
    softwares and renew them every year,and in result millions of students are deprived
    of this oppurtunity:just see the engineering universities: how many students actually
    know the use of AUTOCAD or other CAD programs??? similar is the case in all the
    other sciences...I use Matlab for all my numerical solutions and its ''limited''
    student version (server based) would cost 1500-USD!!! thats almost 87000Rs!!!
    but thanks to hafeez center, i got a fully ''cracked & complete'' version for
    40Rs and its on the toplist of OSSEP (so are many WinOS+office2003+CAD programs)...Now
    im waiting for Shakir to come back with a Fresh 2004-LOT of installers+some new
    science packages!! And yes i am soon launching my OWN-NON-HISTORICAL-SPORTS &
    SCIENCE-BASED blog titled : www.chicagomistry.com ...'

    Crackdown on piracy is actually good, as that should/might encourage the use of opensource software.

    <i>Dare I suggest a capitalist enterprise subsidize their product?</i>
    Selling at a lower price doesn't mean a subsidy - it just means they're selling it at a lower price. No one's asking these companies to sell at a loss - considering the distrubution/retail costs in the US, they could sell here at a much lower price and still make hefty profits.

    KO: Yes, even though I did not mention it. My hope is that such a crackdown will encourage OSS. We need to take a cue from Japan/China/S.Korea's recent collaboration to compile their own OS Desktop Operating System.
    Dare I say, a Indo-Pak OS?

  content: "Sorry ! You are asking about piracy in Pakistan.Unfortunately Microsoft
    and other software developers are least interested in selling their legal products
    in Pakistan. It's amazing ,no locations is available here for the legal softs. Prices
    of softwares are in hundrards of dollars which may force a user to use a pirated
    one in  the Globe and specially in 3rd world nations ,where per capita income
    is very low. In pakistan a machine ( P-IV  > 3GHZ with Intel OEM borads and
    best accessories) is for 500$ and a used one is for 100$ or less .One may like
    to buy the licenced softwares not more than 10$ each or a plateform for somewhat
    high price. don't abuse the terrorists for a 0.5 $ Software cause the initial
    cost for a disk is almost 0.2$ to 0.3$ .It may be an easy source of icome for
    shopkeeper and not the terrorist.Some neighbouring countries make efforts and
    supply funds to these peoples to develop unrest in Pakistan. Major factor for
    pirated softwares is the high prices of softwares. Softwares Manufacturers
    should demand reasonable prices  in  Pakistan and may give the opportunities of
    installments in 3rd world countries specially Pakistan."

    I think that anyone will agree that a bootable WinXP disc for less than a buck (Canadian) is pretty dope.



    Piracy is everywhere, the only difference is that Pakistan is on Easy Mode when it comes to piracy in that they don't need a phat pipe (broadband internet); they simply need to make a trip to the local software shop to acquire many times the product attainale through the 'net in a fraction of the price and time.

    My take on piracy in Pakistan:



    [url=http://www.asadasif.com/?itemid=68]Windows XP activation woes and piracy in Pakistan[/url]
---
<p><img src="/img/piracy.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Every Pakistani's heart swells with pride when we learn that Pakistan is #1 in anything. Imagine my elation when I learned that Pakistan now claims <a href="http://www.bday.co.za/bday/content/direct/1,3523,1652162-6094-0,00.html">tops in the world</a> in piracy. The <a href="http://www.iipa.com/">International Intellectual Property Alliance</a> released a report a few days ago which argues that Pakistan's status as preferred trading partner of US be re-evaluated until they re-evaluate their effort to fight piracy because:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif"> Trade losses due to piracy for 2003 were estimated at $134 million with Pakistan receiving $91.9 million in GSP benefits. Pakistan has become one of the world√≠s leading producers and  exporters of pirated optical discs (CDs, DVDs, VCDs, CD-ROMs) of copyrighted sound recordings,  motion pictures, business and entertainment software and published materials. Eight known facilities in  Pakistan produced upwards of 180 million discs in 2003, nearly all illegal; most are being exported  around the world to at least 46 other countries. The Pakistan government took some cosmetic steps early  in 2004 to address the escalating problem (establishing an inter-ministerial group and inspecting and  temporarily shutting down several of the optical disc plants), but currently all the plants are back in  operation.  The Pakistani government has failed to deal fundamentally with piracy, and we call upon the  Government of Pakistan to quickly address these issues.  Book piracy also remains a serious problem in  Pakistan, and other types of piracy (e.g., end-user piracy of business software) must be addressed by the  government. <img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Anyone who has been to Hall Road or Hafeez Centre in Lahore knows the bounty of software, movies, PS2 and computer games that is available for $1.60 each. They are cheaper in Karachi. Leave aside that the greatest number of pirated DVDs and VCDs are the Bollywood movies not Hollywood. I saw suitcase full of DVDs carried out of Lahore International. I don't know <i>whose</i> suitcase it was, or I would have notified authorities. </p>
<p>Don't shrug that this piracy nonsense is so much boo-hoo by the First World. Interpol reported last month that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=industryNews&storyID=5390277">piracy money funded terrorist organizations</a> such as <i>Hizbollah</i> and <i>Lashkar-i Tayiba</i>. Ouch. </p>
<p>As KO wrote in an excellent post on <a href="http://ko.offroadpakistan.com/computing/2004_02/software_piracy_in_pakistan.html">software piracy</a>, one glaring cause of piracy in Pakistan is the lack of any legal venues of sales and acquistion of software, movies or games. Compound to that the fact that if the price of a dvd in US is $20, no one will ever pay Rs. 1100 for <i>White Chicks</i>. But, all is not lost.</p>
<p>First, we need legal salepoints for DVDs, games and software. Second, they need to be competitively priced. Dare I suggest a capitalist enterprise subsidize their product? Yes, I do. Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a> has conclusively proved the feasability of legal downloads of music for an attractive price. But how to produce a legal DVD that can sell in Pakistan? Move the production facilities for the region into the region. Have locally produced copies available in the market for a slight premium. I'd wager that a consumer in Pakistan will fork over Rs. 400-500 for an attractively packaged, blemish free product. In essence, we need legitimate venues both for capitalist enterprise and for building good little consumers.</p>
