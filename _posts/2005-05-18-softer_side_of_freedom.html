  content: "I praise the president Musharraf not on the reasons that he is one of
    the most powerful, straight forward, enlightend and friendly president; but on
    the basis that he is sincere to pakistan unlike majority of our known rooted and
    sprouted politicians. This is misfortune for Pakistan that he is an army man and
    has no democratic basis. Even then he may be popular by giving mass relief to
    his  nation in the budgets. He knows that he has to harvest thorns sown by his
    ancestors by taking non-popular and  illogical decisions. But he has no choice
    except to take U turn decsions which were fully backed by the US in the near Past.
    \nHad he been accompanied with a few so called master mind politician, he would
    have done a lot for the development of our country. If US can start wars in
    Afghanistan and Iraq to maintain peace, General Musharraf is fuuly justified to
    establish democracy while wearing uniform."

    I wonder if his illustrious predecessors can match the fervor with which he defends his Na Pak Fauj's divine right of picking up pieces of prime real estate...

    Then again, maybe us (bloody civvie) pseudo-intellectuals shouldn't be jealous...

  content: Musharaf is sincere to only one person:himself. All his actions are geared
    to protect himself. Like the American lawyer said, he had no compunction sellig
    his mother(land) down the river to save his skin. Anyone who praises Musharaf
    is either a hypocrite or an enemy of democracy.

  content: 'He is still better than the previously elected democratic leaders. I guess
    we sometimes get too bogged down by the concept of democracy. Take for example
    India: does true democracy exist here? I doubt that. True democracy doesn''t even
    exist in America. At a very advanced stage of human civilization we''ll be able
    to grasp the real essence of democracy because democracy greatly hinges on the
    sense of responsibility.'

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/generalprez.jpg"><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/03/10/the_arab_spring/">Freedom</a>, as they say, is growing in leaps and bounds. And, one of the places it is leaping right over is Pakistan. In an announcement leaked to press, and surprising only to the South Asia Desk at State, The General has decided to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=764809">"stand for elections after his current term expires in 2007"</a>. Of course, this is for the better of all <a href="http://danial.pixelsndots.com/archives/261/">concerned</a>. Right? </p>
<p>I am going to come off as a broken record by now. Here is what they say: <i>The General is good for Pakistan. He can keep the jihadists in check. He is good for the US. He can hunt for UBL. He is good for the economy. He is good for peace with India. He is good guy. He means well. He promises Enlightened Moderation. He shoots straight from the hip.</i> Here is what I say: <i>Bullshit.</i> Give the Pakistani people what they deserve: Democracy.</p>
<p>One must remember, though, that there is no problem that a sychophantic press and a media consultant can't fix. Democracy included. The truth is that this General is not my father's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq">General</a> or my grandfather's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayub_Khan">General</a>. This General <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/may2005-weekly/nos-15-05-2005/instep.htm#1">"can talk politics with Manmohan Singh and entertainment with Shahrukh Khan and Rani Mukerjee. Democracy, the LFO and coup d'etats aside, the President, to put it in a nutshell, is 'cool'."</a>. COOL, I say. Take that, Mugabe. Take that, Lil' Kim. </p>
<p>In a puff piece that will shame Jeff Gannon, <i>The News International</i> visits The General to find him delighting to some Pakistani pop on his Bang and Olufsen system "which is one of the best sound systems you can buy"; ruminating on Urdu "Even Indian songs are in Urdu"; on the gentler side of Pakistan "Extremists held sway and they pushed the soft face; the art face of Pakistan into the background calling it un&Atilde;&plusmn;Islamic whereas it is not"; on Art "Islamic art has been embraced and adopted by many in the world. It is known as Islamic art. It is Islamic and we should be very proud of it". Right you are, Mr. President.</p>
<p>To show the world the "soft face" of Pakistan, The General has hired a <a href="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&subsection=Pakistan+%26+Sub-Continent&month=May2005&file=World_News2005051610358.xml">media advisor</a>: One <a href="http://www.despardes.com/people/feb19%20Mahreen%20Khan.htm">Mahreen Khan</a>. I wish <i>India Shining</i> on the lot of them. I also breathlessly await the next press briefing from the State Dept. to see what they have to say about freedom in Pakistan.</p>
