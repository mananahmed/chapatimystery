<p>"I haven't had an orthodox blog, and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The <a href="http://simonworld.mu.nu/archives/056988.php">first time</a> I didn't feel it, but <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/001601.html">this time</a> I feel it, and I can't deny the fact that you like me, right now, you like me!"</p>
<p>With heartfelt thanks to those who voted and with apologies to Sally Field. Just being nominated for the Koufax awards makes my Sunday.</p>
