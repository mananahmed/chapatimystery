  content: "A really bizarre coincidence: yesterday night I shouted 'you're a nut,
    you're a nut! you're crazy in the coconut!' at someone -- and they didn't get
    it. So I took a nostalgic trip back on Youtube to my A-level days (c. 2000, when
    this song was pretty huge in the UK) to culturally re-educate a confused American.
    Today I come on to CM and it's here.  Short answer: Jung was right."
