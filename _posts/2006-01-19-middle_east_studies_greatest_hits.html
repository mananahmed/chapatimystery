  content: Interesting list, indeed a bit polisci heavy, and not all on the *modern*
    Middle East at all. I am quite curious to know who they interviewed.  <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/01-02/awards-richards.asp"
    rel="nofollow">Another article</a> notes that the respondants were based in US,
    UK, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel.  The bias is clear, as with only two exceptions
    the list is all either surveys or books that focus on the Arabophone Middle East
    (inclding Egypt but not the rest of North Africa).  I think Mottahedeh belongs
    there, but certainly one would like to see another book or two on modern Iran
    on a list that claims to cover the whole ME region.  And Bernard Lewis as the
    only text on Turkey is troubling. I agree with Sepoy that Janet Abu-Lughod definitely
    belongs here (and perhaps also Lila Abu-Lughod's Veiled Sentiments).  I would
    also vote for Khaled Abou El Fadl's Corrupting God's Book, plus some more anthropology
    (Cohen on Lawrence of Arabia, Messick on textuality and state in Yemen) in addition
    to more titles on Turkey and Iran.  Maybe we should do our own poll.

  content: "ah, the dacoit returns!\n\nthe list of people who responded is in their
    <a href=\"http://www.aucegypt.edu/academic/mesc/PDF/MESC November 2005 Issue.pdf\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">newsletter</a>. They say that they will re-do the survey over
    the summer and try and get more people outside of continental USA. That same newsletter,
    funnily enough, has a discussion of \"Middle East\". \n\nAs for B. Lewis, I don't
    want to see ANYTHING by him but if I had to, I would have chosen his monograph
    on the Assassins over Turkey.\n\nI would say Turban for the Crown by Arjomand
    is another must-be-on-the-list.\n\n\n\nAlso, for a poll, I think a far more illuminating
    question to ask from Middle/Near East people would be: What are the five books
    from your Orals/Exams List that you still use?"

    Ay, what a bizarre list--  it's sort of a combination of old (maybe even obsolete) stalwarts, and recently popular &amp; trendy titles (hence two Timothy Mitchells, and the Lockman, which is an interesting book, yeah, but in the top 20?)  Lewis as the only Turkey title is really disturbing--the book is well-written, but terribly outdated, with a dubious acceptance of the Kemalist narrative cobbled together with modernization theory.   The fact that it's on this list says a lot about the marginalization of Turkey (and Iran) in ME studies as a whole.  (Not that I'm bitter or anything).  I get the feeling that the respondants cited the books of the mentors who influenced them 20 years ago--for me, some of their own books would be on the list, instead.

    I'm delighted to see Lisa Wedeen, though--that book is far &amp; away the best thing I've ever read on Syria, and should be read far beyond area studies circles.

    Otherwise--echoing the calls for more anthropology, sociology, cultural history, like the assorted Abu-Lughods (I read "Beyond European Hegemony" when I was 17, in the college class that turned my head inside-out &amp; made me decide to be an academic.  It completely reshaped the way I thought about history.  And "Veiled Sentiments" is certainly one the of top ME anthropology books of the last 30 years, as well as just a lovely read).  Yes also to dacoit's rec. of Brink Messick's "The Calligraphic State."  I'd also add:  Walter Armbrust's "Modernity and Mass Culture in Egypt" Eickelman &amp; Piscatori's "Muslim Politics," Ussama Makdisi's "The Culture of Sectarianism", Sami Zubaida's "Islam, the People, and the State."  Toby Dodge or Charles Tripp on Iraq, Andrew Shryock on nationalism in Jordan, and  Martin Stokes, because everything he writes is just so much fun to read.  It's not as much of an "academic" book, but if I could make everyone in the country read on thing on the ME it would be Rashid Khalidi's "Resurrecting Empire."

    For Turkey and the Ottoman Empire-- Eric-Jan Zurcher's "Turkey: a Modern History" is dry, but the best general history at the moment.  My mentor's just gotten a contract from CUP to write a book that I think will supplant it.  Feroz Ahmad's stuff is better than Lewis.  Bozdogan &amp; Kasaba's "Rethinking Modernity and National Identity in Turkey" is awesome, also good are Michael Meeker's "A Nation of Empire", Hasan Kayali's "Arabs and Young Turks," and Eugene Rogan and Cemal Kafadar's books.  I'm currently working as an editor for the 19th/20th C.  volume of the new Cambridge History of Turkey, and another book coming out of an Oxford conference on "Turkey's Encounter With Modernity"-- and if the drafts I've seen thus far are any indication, both will be good.

    Ok, I have to go make my own post on this now.

    I love a good book list and a nice debate.  So now we have a chopped, screwed and fortified Middle East list (both in the comments here and over at <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/2006/01/middle-east-studies-bookshelf-in-my.html" rel="nofollow">Verbal Privilege</a>, which features an alternative list rich on Ottoman imperial and Turkish concerns) and a proposal on the table for a South Asia list (not exactly what I meant - but thanks for drawing out the logical implication Prachi).

    Let's get it started on the South Asia list: I bid Event, Metaphor, Memory; anyone care to raise me an Empire and Information or Elementary Aspects?

  content: "Bernard Lewis?!\n\n\nPoor, poor Iranian studies. Let's pretend it's part
    of the Middle East:\n\nAfsaneh Najmabadi's Men without Beards, Women without Mustaches
    and The Story of the Daughters of Quchan are both good 19th and 20th century works
    of critical history and historiography, as are Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi's Refashioning
    Iran and Firuzeh Kashani-Sabet's Frontier Fictions.   \n\nFariba Adelkhah's Being
    Modern in Iran and Ziba Mir-Hosseini's Islam and Gender are excellent anthropological
    works. \n\nI like Janet Abu-Lughod's work, but Engseng Ho's The Graves of Tarim
    is going to knock people's socks off when it come out this spring. \n\nKathryn
    Babayan's Mystics, Monarchs and Messiahs is excellent for Safavid cultural history.\n\nFor
    more general stuff, Arjomand's Turban for the Crown and Abrahamian's Iran between
    two Revolutions and Khomeinism are good. \n\nAnd I like Farzaneh Milani's Veil's
    and Words for Modern Iranian literature. \n\nI also think South and Central Asia
    and Indian Ocean Studies should be included on the basis on Persianate and Islamicate
    cultural ties. That's what I am imbibbing for orals and for a good long time beyond.
    I'd have to say my favorite historian in this realm is Sanjay Subrahmanyam. But
    since getting non-Arab countries that are geographically part of the Middle East
    in there seems to so difficult, maybe that's a battle for another day!"

  content: "Hi all,\n\nI worked on the list and just wanted to answer a few questions,
    make a few responses.\n\n\n\n*Interesting list, indeed a bit polisci heavy*\n\nYou&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;re
    right.  We were faced to come to terms with this fact when we published our results,
    noting that, \n\n\"Our original decisions about which professors to contact \n\nobviously
    influenced the shape that the compiled book list would\n\ntake. Most of the professors
    we contacted were political\n\nscientists, modern historians, and economists.
    Our bias was not\n\nlost on the respondents: 'Your list of faculty contacts is
    very\n\nheavily weighted to modern studies&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Acirc;&para;
    I am almost the only\n\nmedievalist in the lot. I assume your list will also be
    skewed in\n\nthis way.' This will be one of the issues addressed in the list we\n\nwill
    compile this summer.\"\n\n\n\n*The bias is clear, as with only two exceptions
    the list is all either surveys or books that focus on the Arabophone Middle East
    (inclding Egypt but not the rest of North Africa).*\n\nToo true.  Hopefully this
    can be remedied this summer.  I would love to find THE book on Tunisia.\n\n\n\n*I
    agree with Sepoy that Janet Abu-Lughod definitely belongs here (and perhaps also
    Lila Abu-Lughod&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s Veiled Sentiments).*\n\nVeiled
    Sentiments tied with about a dozen other books for &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;22nd
    place.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;  They were accorded a
    runner-up status in the newsletter.  I know that won&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t
    satisfy you, but thankfully I&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;m
    not responsible, as I accorded myself no votes in the survey.  \n\n\n\n*That same
    newsletter, funnily enough, has a discussion of &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;Middle
    East&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;.*\n\nMany people working
    on that same newsletter, funnily enough, disagreed with my classification of Chad
    as a Middle Eastern country.  \n\n\n\n*Ay, what a bizarre list&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&not;
    it&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s sort of a combination of
    old (maybe even obsolete) stalwarts, and recently popular &amp; trendy titles
    (hence two Timothy Mitchells...*\n\nI found Rule of Experts too insightful and
    entertaining to be considered trendy.  But I think your label of &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;bizarre&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;
    fits nicely.\n\n\n\n *But because I enjoy few things more evangelizing about good
    books, here's a completely idiosyncratic list of readings on the Middle East that
    were not already on the AUC list... (from elizabeth&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s
    post at her Verbal Priveledge)*\n\nAlternative list #1.  My Radcliffe publishing
    house.  My Brian de Bois-Guilbert.  Most excellent.\n\n\n\nDo any of you have
    recommendations for Middle East studies professors, experts to contact for the
    revised survey this summer? (Aside from the authors of the works you have recommended.)
    It would make the job of compiling a larger survey request list that much easier.\n\n\n\nHave
    a good one,\n\nGarth"

    Hi Garth-- write to the H-Turk list as well, if you want to get some more books on Turkey and the Ottoman Empire in the mix.  And by 'trendy' I didn't mean 'no good', just that Mitchell's work is fairly recent (by the standards of the list), and very popular (also likely to be much-copied!)  I haven't read Rule of Experts yet, but thought Colonising Egypt was very good.  James McDougall at Princeton would be a good person for N. Africa recommendations....

    and tattooed hand: yee-haw, let's tear down the area studies barricades!  i'm with you.  ditto on Fariba Adelkhah (who is a lovely person as well as a whip-smart scholar) and Afsaneh Najmabadi.  The latter I only know though her chapters in various collections, incl. Kandiyoti's...I think the reason several edited volumes pop up on my list is that some individual chapters and/or journal articles would rival actual books (like Suad Joseph's work on gender and family, which I'd choose if there were a full-length monograph to put down)  But that's another kettle.
