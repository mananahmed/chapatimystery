  content: "Thanks for the link, my friend. \n\n\n\nAs a side note, I always find
    myself turning faintly green when I utter the phrase \"imagined communities\"
    aloud. I still do it sometimes. But there are more interesting ways to talk about
    what nationalism is/does..."

<p>The funny bit in the new edition of Benedict Anderson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imagined-Communities-Reflections-Origin-Spread-Nationalism-New-/dp/1844670864/sr=8-2/qid=1158791931/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-7527644-6783117?ie=UTF8&s=books">Imagined Communities</a> is Anderson's usage of <b>IC</b>... "<i>Aside from the advantages of brevity, IC restfully occludes a pair of words from which the vampires of banality have by now sucked almost all the blood."</i> [<a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n18/clar05_.html">via</a>]. Ouch. Yes, some have flogged the imagining horse to death. Yet, we should take note of an earlier, more substantial engagement by Ronald Inden -  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imagining-India/dp/0253213584/sr=1-1/qid=1158792043/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7527644-6783117?ie=UTF8&s=books">Imagining India</a>. With both of these texts, I have more than a passing familiarity, as I assume many of my readers would. Hence, I point you to Amardeep Singh's call for papers for <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2006/09/imagining-south-asia-journal-cfp.html">Imagining South Asia</a> - a special journal issue. If it suits you, submit something. I will see if Ron wants to send along a short 'Reflections on the usage of the term 'Imagining'...'</p>
