<p>Doing some research, I came across an official Pakistan government publication celebrating the 5 year anniversary of its existence. I scanned a few of the adverts in the issue. The paper I am writing concerns the "long history" of Pakistan such that allowed Mortimer Wheeler's <em>Five Thousand Years of Pakistan: An Archaeological Outline</em> (1950) to become a standard account of pre-Partition "Pakistan". Here, the ads themselves speak towards the need to assert the primacy of the Pakistani history. </p>
