  content: "When God is the answer to every question then end result is unmistakable.  As
    long as Pakistan could get money from US, Saudi Arabia and China then there
    was no need to resource planning. Elites could be bribed into doing other countries
    bidding. Politics is always about kabuki theater, it is just that God is central actor
    in Pakistan. Pakistan is modern day Sparta.  You know what happened to Sparta.  All
    resources going to Military is not going to change, not until Pakistan takes
    over India.  That is your myth.  National Myths cannot be changed over night
    only thru hard slog. US and China will use and abuse you as long as there is
    oil in Iran. What you can't explain is that why Pakistan never reconciled with
    Iran even when US was running it.  Even if you could wave a magic wand
    and get an educated middle class, they would all have to leave in order to
    find jobs. Pakistan only needs feudal lords, clergy and generals everyone else opinion
    don't matter.  Rest of the world actually is shaped by the merchant class and
    not by intellectuals reading historical tea leaves. kids are only educated
    as much as the corporations want them to be.  Pakistan has no natural resources
    that it can use to get ahead unless it is exporting terrorism."

  content: "<i> \"the general mood of a South Asian Muslim community that saw itself
    under siege and at a particular nadir in historical time&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;colonised,
    devoid of political and social power\" </i>  Was there ever a  South Asian
    Muslim 'community' in any useful sense of the term ? Did this 'community' as a
    whole ever enjoy political and/or social power ?"

  content: "hi,  nice one...although i don't fully support your premise that
    \"Pakistan's crisis can't simply be explained
    by religion\"...Now the term religion itself has multiple connotations...What
    has happened in Pakistan is the shift from religion as 'faith' to religion as
    a 'political ideology'...religion as a political ideology is a potent idea because
    it closes all avenues for debate, and this has happened elsewhere too...like the
    hindutva movement hardly had anything to do with hinduism as a 'faith'...however
    it's successful reinvention of 'ram' as the supreme deity, and by extension the
    reformulation of 'ram rajya' as a political idea which could not be contested
    or criticized  if you were a 'true hindu' was a clever strategy in manipulating
    public opinion...the same is happening to mohammed...by using him as a shield,
    the right wingers have clearly managed to make their political/legal immune to
    any scrutiny..."

  content: "Good article. Though would add that in both Bangladesh and Malaysia
    Islam is used in a very very political manner, and in Bangladesh there has indeed
    be similar, though far less, damage caused in the name of Islam.  I get the
    authers point; don't blame the religion, blame the political types, and certainly
    know that at certain points, mostly long past, in European history, religion has
    been used in similar fashion. How does Pakistan free itself ? Is it even
    possible ? I have a theory about a colony maintaining 'mother country. traditions
    long after the mother culture had dropped them. Will Pakistan be striving to emulate
    an 8 th century AD Islamic reality at the same time as Saudi Arabia is attempting
    to move into the present day ?  Joke ? Probably. Anyway, great article,
    and thank  you."

  content: "Indeed, it is true that religion alone cannot explain the crisis in Pakistan.
    However, it is the present authoritarian context bought easily (and naturally
    I believe) by majority that needs to be deconstructed immediately by religious
    intelligentsia in particular and all students of religion in general to create
    possibilities for coming out of this crisis. I share my formative thoughts here:  http://hangingodes.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/blasphemy-discourses-i-deconstructing-the-contemporary-context/"
