    Especially considering that Apple has been able to do Devanagari with no trouble for years, now. I don't know what the Urdu support is, but considering what a nightmare it has become to get Hebrew to work with MSOffice (for famous profs), there might be a disinclination there. But at least MS is still not taking care of it for Office 2004. Fantastic.

    So there you go. I'm still waiting for the Macs to let me make a logical Lithuanian keyboard layout.

    From PC Tanzania via PC St. Vincent:  Apple's presence in most of Africa is pretty horrible too.  Zero official Apple business in TZ (and most of East Africa I assume), and I think the closest reseller is in Nairobi, Kenya.  So my 12" PBG4 is virtually alone here on the east coast of the (now brightening) Dark Continent.
    In related news, the open-sourcers are as always making progress where others fail and flail.  OpenOffice et. al. now (or soon will) have dictionaries for Swahili, Zulu, and other African languages.

  content: Well, the Apple conditions arent so good here in Scandanvia too. They have
    only one proper outlet in Sweden and in Denmark you will be unable to spot a MAC
    machine, unless you are associated with some sort of research center.Many of us
    here are just tired of reinstalling Windows & Patches all the time..WIN OS is
    just so crappy....I think Linux could be a better solution!!!

  content: sO whats the big fuss about apple/MAC anyway? i mean..hello? theres a reason
    why the whole entire world (excluding north america) uses misrosoft/windows (
    and no its not only becuz you can get pirated software). as a species all of man
    kind has gravitated towards universality...c.f George Ritzer and the success of
    McDOnalidization. we LIKE knowing everything- cuz we're supposed to know. hence
    the popularity of windows cuz even when you DON'T kno its leads you to believe
    that you DO. did that make sense? well it does to me ~;)

  content: The whole point to this is simple. MacOS X is a UNIX based OS. Apple simply
    made the best GUI. X on Linux is the worst. Windows works because it works. There's
    no beating a mac, but you can run MacOS X on a PC using an emulator. What emulator
    runs it? Find it on Google or on sourceforge.net. You won't get the performance
    of a Mac, but it's certainly cool for developers and programmers.

  content: Well, I live in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia but I bought my Mac in UK.  Although
    it has WorldWide warranty, when things go wrong it is suddenly EXTREMELY difficult
    to get it fixed!  They sell Mac in Saudi but don't fix them!  The nearest place
    to get them fixed is Dubai, and they won't fix them until they get authority from
    US - and in spite of modern communications, all this takes about 3 weeks before
    you can even send  your sick machine there.  I am disillusioned with Mac and its
    so called World Wide Warranty!

    at regular US price. I bet you could find more Mac stuff. I haven't gone there
    in like a year, so it may have changed, but I will be going soo.

  content: "pakistan has a lot of problems\r\nbut this is certainly not one of them\r\n\r\nipods
    are widely available in hafeez center, maybe you went to a 'mobile shop' instead
    of a 'computer shop' in hafeez center\r\n\r\nas for apple notebooks, you're right,
    hafeez center probably wont have it, but probably can find upon searching harder\r\n\r\ni
    just did a search on google for 'buy apple notebook lahore'\r\nand found few results\r\nhttp://www.shophive.com/shophive/Apple-MacBook-Pro-p-2866.pakistan.html\r\nthey
    have more apple products on the same site\r\n\r\nso my point is, online or offline,
    search harder\r\nyou'll get it\r\nmaybe not at hafeez center, but certainly at
    other places in lahore"

<p>On my recent trip to Pakistan, my father loved the simplicity of OS X.3 and asked me to find him an apple powerbook in Pakistan. I went to Hafeez Center - the tech center of Lahore - and inquired around for an Apple reseller. Ha! No one in 4 teeming floors had heard of such a thing. Sure, they knew the legends of Apple but none had seen one with their eyes. The common view was the hardware was too expensive and that no microsoft software runs on them (which effectively puts you out of the piracy market).<br />
I would have left my powerbook with my father but I knew there was no support structure for him and a tech call every 2 years is not cool.<br />
Today I read that the <a href="http://gigaom.com/archives/2004/04/in_india_mac_is_a_rotten_apple.html">state of Apple is bad </a>in India as well. It is a shame that Apple is not pursuing such markets as South Asia and China. With the best OS in the game, what are they waiting for? Like Om says, they can at least sell the eMacs at a competitive price.<br />
Apple: If you are interested, I have the business cards of several Hafeez Center entreprenuers who salivated over my powerbook.</p>
