<p>via <a href="http://basas-southasia.blogspot.com/2008/06/falak-sufi-memorial-prize.html">BASAS</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to draw your attention to a new annual accademic prize that has been instituted for Humanities and Social Science students studying at a university in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Falak Sufi Memorial Prize has been established to support innovative work on women and gender in South Asia by Pakistani undergraduate and graduate students. This prize is meant to honor a Pakistani student in a Pakistani college or university for his or her excellence in research and writing in the fields of women and gender studies.</p>
<p>The Prize aims: firstly, to recognize undergraduate and graduate students interested in the topic who often have had lesser opportunities for such recognition, and secondly, to contribute to the vibrancy of the study of humanities and social sciences in Pakistan.</p>
<p>This Prize was established to honor the contributions of Falak Sufi, a Pakistani scholar of women and gender in South Asia.</p>
<p>For fuller details on the rubric of the Prize, kindly refer to: <a href="http://www.fsmprize.com">www.fsmprize.com</a><br />
Please circulate this post as widely as possible to relevant individuals and bodies.</p></blockquote>
