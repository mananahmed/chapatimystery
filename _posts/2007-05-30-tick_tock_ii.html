  content: 'This is the wonderful stuff of politics: The US "agenda" runs counter
    to its "policy". Musharraf would be more popular in Pakistan if he got out of
    the clutches of the US; the US would be more popular in Pakistan if they dropped
    their support of Musharraf. I feel the urge to read "Catch-22" again. (Sorry if
    this doesn''t sound like a serious response to serious problems, but I assume
    y''all know enough not to  expect the outlook to change from the US side any time
    in the next year and a half, at least. I am curious to know if anyone thinks that
    really matters.)'

  content: 'Desi: Understood--seriously, of course, in theory one should serve the
    other. "But in practice," to continue using Ms. Schaffer''s language, spreading
    democracy has never been high on this administration''s list of priorities, except
    where it provides a convenient pretext for carrying out actual policy (e.g., in
    Iraq). What I find funnier is that even the stated agenda, counter-terrorism,
    is itself a pretext for this administration''s actual agenda. It''s all just words,
    of course, but it''s kind of entertaining, in a perverse way, to see how the poor
    things are abused....'

  content: "Zalman:\r\n\r\n\"spreading democracy has never been high on this administration&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    list of priorities, except where it provides a convenient pretext for carrying
    out actual policy (e.g., in Iraq).\"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely.  What I was trying to
    say is that the US' \"agenda\" is not really what it says it is; \"democracy\"
    is the window dressing that they use to clothe their policy. So in that sense,
    agenda (establishing a \"free market\" where the US actually has the upper hand)=policy
    (establish free market).\r\n\r\nAnd another thing that I've noticed, too: \"democracy\"
    is all to conveniently conflated with \"free market.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\"Overall
    it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s really an outrageous situation that Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    citizens have to put up with these abuses.\"\r\n\r\nI'm going to join your club-
    there are free speech abuses galore everywhere...\r\n\r\nBut I think it's absolutely
    fantastic that you have people who refuse to put up with these abuses, despite
    it all.  Like the Dawn says something. Or Geo TV. Or the lawyers and other activists
    that have consistenly protested against the assault of the judiciary. The civil
    society groups in Pakistan that have rightfully criticized Musharraf's watered
    down version of the Hudood Ordinances. Or the Pakistan Independent Human Rights
    Commission that criticizes the government.\r\n\r\nI find all those folks really
    admirable.\r\n\r\nThen you think about everything that has happened in the US
    (US attorney firings, illegal moves, system devaluation of civil rights, lies
    pushed by the administration to wage wars, etc), and you realize that America
    is generally a pretty complacent nation."

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700977_pf.html">A U.S. diplomat, who was not authorized to speak for the record, confirmed last week that the United States plans to stick with Musharraf. "We are not pulling back from that relationship in any way," the diplomat said.</a></p>
