  content: "Yes, you don't care if your information is fed into a giant database,
    shared by that company to others who will send you emails from Ticketmaster, Virgin
    Music or BMG. And since iTunes has your email and your credit card, they can send
    that off to financial institutions who can send you more junk personalized by
    Britney Spears' pleas for a five year CD bond. \n\n[snore]"

  content: The part I like is where Amazon--the source of about 99% of the music I
    buy--doesn't have my cc info, email, or a database tracking what I like. Because
    that would suck, not unlike the mini i-store.

  content: Unlike how Amazon has a privacy policy that they advertise everywhere and
    tell me what data they have and how they use it. And yeah.

<p><s>I know I have immaculate taste in Music but I'd rather <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html">keep that information to myself</a>. And the mini-Store is useless in terms of UI, in any case</s>. [<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060111071001306">?</a>]</p>
