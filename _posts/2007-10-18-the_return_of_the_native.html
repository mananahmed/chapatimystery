  content: "Here are BB'S own thoughts about suicide attempts on Pakistani elites.
    \ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenazir Bhutto\r\nMonday August 9, 2004\r\nThe Guardian \r\n\r\n\"\r\n
    Pakistan is a frontline state in the war against terrorism. Most of the leading
    terrorists have been arrested in Pakistan......,.\r\n  The positive part is that
    General Pervez Musharraf gets to play good cop and earn Washington's pleasure
    to continue his dictatorship. The bad part is that eyebrows are raised as to why
    leading al-Qaida militants found it necessary to hide in a land run by Washington's
    \"key ally\" in the war against terror. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Pakistan, assassinations
    and suicide bombings have also been increasing domestically.......,. \r\n\r\nNone
    of the assassins has been arrested. Instead, public attention has been focused
    on five apparent assassination attempts against high-profile targets that have
    taken place since last December: two attacks on Gen Musharraf, and one each on
    the Karachi corps commander, the prime minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz, and the
    Baluchistan chief minister. \r\n\r\nWhile the regime insists these were genuine
    assassination attempts, their pattern suggests something different. At most, they
    seem to have been attempts to frighten the targets. At worst, if the cynics are
    to be believed, the attacks were stage-managed for external consumption. \r\n\r\nFor
    example, in each case, the bombers used low intensity explosives. None of the
    people hurt or killed was of political value - though they were, of course, of
    personal and national value. These included innocent people escorting the apparent
    targets. The main targets escaped without a scratch. While it is welcome that
    they survived, the larger issue needs resolving. \r\n\r\nThe drivers in the corps
    commander's and prime minister-designate's cars were killed, but the other passengers
    escaped unscathed. It is difficult to believe that bombers would repeatedly use
    low-intensity explosives so that only one occupant of the car being attacked -
    or a person outside the car - would die. A public commission into these attacks
    is needed.\" \r\n\r\n&Acirc;&middot; Benazir Bhutto is chairperson of the Pakistan
    People's party and a former prime minister of Pakistan"

    such a homecoming parade. She knew extremists were plotting to kill her.

<p>She was on her way to Jinnah's tomb. Happened around 12:15 local, over 125 dead, over 540 injured. Went off near a few police vans and PPP security cars. Benazir Bhutto was riding in a fortified, bullet-proof truck. That may have saved her life. </p>
<p>The twin blasts were staggered by less than a minute. GeoTV is reporting that it seemed like the combination of a suicide bomber and a car bomb. Reuters has <a href="http://asia.reuters.com/news/pictures/articleslideshow?articleId=USISL24512920071018&start=1">documentation</a> of the carnage and destruction.</p>
<p>There were more than a few direct <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\10\18\story_18-10-2007_pg3_1">threats</a> against her. </p>
<p>The city has shut down. Police and Rangers have closed down major ports. </p>
<p>The GeoTV anchor just called it <i>Qiyamat-i Sughra</i> - the Lesser Apocalypse. </p>
<p>Karachi Metblog has reports <a href="http://karachi.metblogs.com/archives/2007/10/breaking_news_d.phtml">from the city</a>.</p>
