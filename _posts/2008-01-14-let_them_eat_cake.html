    whether it's wheat flour and/or gram flour... if it's the latter, how the heck
    should one make pakoras???  I would like to add, though, that an astrologer
    in Pakistan predicted long ago that the flour price was going to sky-rocket around
    this time period. It's due to Shani's position."

<p>Of course, one needs flour to make cake. The Dictator Formerly Known As The General recently opined that <a href="http://www.pakistanlink.com/Headlines/Jan08/14/02.htm">the flour crisis</a> is not real and that the cost of flour in Pakistan is, in fact, cheaper than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/story/2008/01/080114_mush_karachi_fz.shtml">neighboring countries</a>. Let it be noted that the price of flour in Pakistan is 3 or 4 times the normal rate and that is <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iLEg9WVu18bellanMjlHcAAGy58A">only if you can find any</a>. The things are so dire that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7187719.stm">army troops are guarding wheat shipments</a>. I wonder if our informed commentator, Fareed Zakaria, was served <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/91662">cake</a> while having tea with Musharraf.</p>
