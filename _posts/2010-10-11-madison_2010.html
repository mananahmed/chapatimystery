  content: "As usual, all of the South Asia panels are at the same time.  And
    for good measure, you're cross-programmed against James Frey!  Let me know when

<p>As documented previously - <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/madison.html">here</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/madison_2008.html">here</a> (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/archives/univercity/guhas_burden.html">here</a>) - there is a great gathering of all South Asianists at UW-Madison every October. This will be <a href="http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/">gathering # 39</a>. I have two panels - one of which is "<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/session2.html">Fractured Genres: The Afterlives of Medieval Indo-Persian Histories</a>" and the other one "<a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/session7.html">Blogs of War: The Analytical Terrain of the Af-Pak Blogosphere</a>". </p>
<p>Come see.</p>
