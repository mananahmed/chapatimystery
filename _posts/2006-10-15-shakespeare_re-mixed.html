  content: "I would like to extend an invitation to you to join in on a collective
    blogging section of our upcoming winter issue of <a href=\"http://reconstruction.eserver.org/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Reconstruction</a>.  The issue is the &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;Theories/Practices
    of Blogging.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;  In addition to
    the special section of posts on blogging there will be about a dozen essays on
    blogging.  The deadline is October 27th.  Our intent in this section
    of the issue will be to collect a wide range of bloggers and link up to their
    statements in regards to why they blog (something many of us are asked) and any
    statement they have on the theories/practices of blogging.  If you already
    have a post on this you can feel free to use it, or, if you are interested, you
    can submit a new one.  We will link to each statement from the issue at
    our site, with the intent of creating a hyperlinked list of statements on blogging
    that can serve as an introduction to blogging (or an expansion of knowledge for
    those already blogging).   If you are interested please contact me at mdbento
    @ gmail.com"

  content: "Having just watched The Banquet (not many movies have visually mersmerized
    me as much as this one...), I want to see The Bad Sleep Well (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/)
    again. It's not as true to the original material as Feng's interpretation, but
    the political context is quite engaging. Then again, the imperial guards (They'd
    make Darth Maul look like a street punk... I KID YOU NOT!) in The Banquet alone
    might get my vote. By the way, I think Feng actually stole a lot of visual cues
    from Hero (ceiling drapes, colors, and themes..).   Sepoy, I agree that
    A face-off between Throne of Bood and Maqbool should be interesting. I must say
    Throne is a pretty darn good adaptation of Macbeth. Although it's not as well
    known as Ran, I think Throne is just as impressive. Should be interesting."

  content: But do Bollywood movies proclaim themselves to be adaptations of the things
    that they are adapted from? Films like Maqbool and Omkara are arty, so the directors
    want you to know their inspiration, but there are many Bombay movies that seem
    to be complete copies of Shakespeare plays without announcing the comparison in
    any way. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095936/" rel="nofollow">Qayamat
    se Qayamat tak</a> (1988), for example, couldn't be anything but Romeo and Juliet,
    but does anyone ever say it is?

  content: "No suggestions for films.  BUT, if I were teaching \"Shakespeare in Asian
    Cinema\" I might use some of the basic Shakespeare scholarship on the \"domestic\"
    and the \"foreign\" in the plays, alongside the Shakespeare texts.  If Shakespeare
    depends upon the play between familiar and exotic spaces, how is this dramatic
    tension used in other times and places?  I actually really like many of the geographic
    spaces invoked in Shakespeare - very fluid, and based on the imagination, or  sometimes
    pragmatic and based on economic ties and trade histories . . .   And I would
    work in Peter Brooks King Lear.  I don't know how, but I would because when a
    girl dashes her head on the rocks she does so by force of will."

    it could, right? Tragic love affairs are, as you very well know, quite common
    in South Asian/Iranian literature as well. But you may be right in the sense that
    some of them may have been well inspired by that famous bard from Lucknow, Wali
    Miya Shaikh Pir.    And Plautus and Aristophenes were quite good at <a href=\"http://quizfan.blogspot.com/2005/07/goat-song.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">acting the goat</a>. In fact, Gulzar should've gone one step
    further with Angoor, by crediting <a href=\"http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/toc.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0101:act=intro:scene=subject\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Plautus' work</a>.  I disliked Maqbool. It bored the heck
    out of me. Throne of Blood on the other hand is hugely impressive.   An
    aside: There is an opera scene from Troilus and Cressida in 'Dil Chahta Hai'.
    And Farhan Akhtar actually pulled it off quite well."

  content: "if we're goin' meta (thanks amardeep) let's go all the way to Raj Kapoor.
    man started off acting in Shakespeare, in his daddy Prithviraj's very Angrez theatre
    company (inspiration for Shakespeare wallah btw). man also clearly could not stop
    being a Shakespearean actor: Raj's first film Aag is clearly a brooding, melancholic
    coming-of-age Hamlet type saga...without the actual Hamlet part.  which brings
    us back to the Quizman's pertinent point (and Lapata's well founded remark): how
    are we limiting spin-offs: translations/ transplants/ inspirations/ vaguely similar/
    self-conscious interpretations?"

    nightingale: as i say in the post, "The movie must proclaim itself an adaptation. " So, as long as they credit Billiam Shakuspeyare. I am fine.

  content: But what do you mean by 'proclaim itself'? How does a film make a proclamation?
    Wouldn't it metastasize if it went about making proclamations? I think before
    we can discuss this anymore we need to rethink what we mean when we say the words
    'proclamation' and 'adaptation'.

    That is easy enough.

    Before that India Censor Board card - a smart-looking JNU english prof [think Arundhati  Roy w/ short, cropped hair] makes a grand proclamation. "This here movie is adapted from XYZ". I am easily satisfied.

<p>Recently, we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488414/">Omkara</a> - Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptation of Othello. A few nights ago, I watched Xiaoxang Feng's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465676/">The Banquet</a> - Hamlet set in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms of China. I could seriously geek out over the visual delights offered by both of these productions, but I will restrain myself since I have another reason behind this post.</p>
<p><b>Course Title: Shakespeare in Asian Cinema</b></p>
<p>Can we come up with a list of movies that can be labelled as adaptations or re-tellings of Shakespeare set in Asia? Difficulty: The movie must proclaim itself an adaptation. We can begin with K.B. Athavale's 1928 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392271/">Khoon-e Nahak</a> [Hamlet] and Sohrab Modi's 1935 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026566/">Khoon Ka Khoon</a> [Hamlet]. J. J. Madan's 1941 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235088/">Zalim Saudagar</a> [Merchant of Venice]. Also, Gulzar's 1982 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215517/">Angoor</a> [Comedy of Errors] or Jaya Raaj's 1997 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199669/">Kaliyattam</a> [Othello]. </p>
<p>Further fun: Comparing South vs. East Asian adapatations.</p>
<p>The Macbeths of Kurosawa [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050613/">Throne of Blood</a>] and Bharadwaj [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379370/">Maqbool</a>] could be compared. Or this Turkish female <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076201/">Hamlet</a>!</p>
<p>Add away.</p>
