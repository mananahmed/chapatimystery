    is there a digital version of books/gazettes/magazines from British India that

<p>Life is rather hectic, gentle readers, and I cannot promise anything here for another ten days or so. However, I promise that once life is returned to me, I will return to you with reports, opinions, excitement of various sorts. I lead you on, because I know you still have feelings for me. </p>
<p>In the meanwhile, here is a riddle. Below is an image from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(magazine)">Punch</a></em>, 1842. Can you guess the context, the jab, what in the world is going on?</p>
