  content: "Troy is my hometown.   Nice picture of the Redman's club neon sign.   Interesting
    choice of neon sign.  Maybe it's a hometown thing.  I merely am remembering  the
    understanding of the members' very strong view on things politics related.  My
    recollections go back at least 25 years.  I believe that a long time ago, Jack
    Daniels was the lead politician of choice at The Redman's.......I think that Jose
    Cuervo was the other party's candidate.  It's a shame you didn't get shots
    of the inside of the courthouse.  Also, the statue on top of the courthouse, with
    her rear end facing the North direction for a reason.  Big history there- history
    of a county seat rivalry.  Fougth out every year by two high school football teams....  I
    know, the shots were all \"Vote Obama\" related, however.   The \"Hope/Obama \"
    sign used to be \"David's shoe store\" when I was a child.  The center of town
    there, we Troy Trojans affectionately call \"The square\", was a hustle and bustle
    place of business when I was young.   I can only hope that my hometown doesn't
    turn into another Elkhart, Indiana.   Promises, Promises, empty promises from
    every politician it seems- no matter what religion, or political party.   I tend
    to lean towards the 9/12 project movement.  I'm tired of all my freedoms being
    ripped away from my Nation.  However, very nice pictures of a few things
    in the center of my hometown.   Memories of freedoms that our great nation's politicians
    will more than likely be ripped from our hands because our nation does not listen
    nor see what's going on in front of them due to Majority Media Hype."

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/2941738104/" title="Hope by sepoy, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2941738104_51dbd1c2bf.jpg" width="375"  alt="Hope" /></a>This past weekend, I visited Troy, Ohio. Besides farangi, the duo from the excellent <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-troy-ohio.html">fivethirtyeight.com</a> were along for the ride. They were shadowing my attempt to convince just ONE ohio voter to cast her ballot for Obama <i>because</i> he is a Muslim. There really is nothing wrong with being a Muslim, man. I am telling you. </p>
<p>Below the fold, are some of the photos I took. You can see the full <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72157608026165411/">set</a> here. You must also go to <a href="http://www.brettmarty.com">Brett's</a> site and see what he was snapping, as I was snapping him. Brett is a friend and I have been a jealous fan of his work for a while. So, go see it.<br />
