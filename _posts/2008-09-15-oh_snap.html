  content: "My academic guilt forces me to point out that the first picture is from
    Bajaur Agency where the Taliban Movement is being oh-so-devout and releasing some
    poor hostages \"for Ramadan\". One thing that is notable in the news report that
    accompanies that picture, in <i>Daily Waqt</i>, they report the statements coming
    not from the Taliban \"spokesperson\" but from the Taliban \"translator\". Funny
    that.  Side splitting, fucking, funny."

<p>So, the caption on this is funnier than any snark from me: "Unemployed youth protest ..."</p>
