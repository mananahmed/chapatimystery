  content: wake up, sepoy -- the Supreme Court of Pakistan today July 31 2008 ruled
    that the Nov. 3 2007 PCO was unconstitutional, the Islamabad High Court is also
    out, and so are scores of PCO judges.  According to Ch Aitizaz Ahsan, Pervez Musharaff
    cannot find a lawyer to defend him at the Supreme Court (no one appeared in court).  NRO
    status still a bit cloudy.

  content: "DECISION IS BIGGEST FRAUD        The decision of Supreme Court dated
    31st of July 2009 as projected by media is the biggest Fraud in Judicial History
    of Pakistan when it says that PCO judges have been sent home. PCO Judges are still
    working and non PCO judges have been sacked, packed and sent home. The beneficiaries
    of the recent judgment are Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Mr. Justice Javed
    Iqbal, Mr. Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan, Mr. Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday
    Mr. Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan, Mr. Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani etc. All
    these judges violated the constitutional oath and took fresh oath under the PCO
    of General Musharaf after Pakistan army ousted Nawaz Sharif in October of 1999. 
    \     The other set of PCO judges are Justice Faqir Muhammad Khokhar and Justice
    Javed Buttar etc. including other judges in High Courts who took oath under the
    PCO on 3rd of November 1999. All of them are judges even today and are still continuing. 
    \     Interestingly the judges who have been sent home had never taken oath under
    any PCO. Most of these Judges were not even appointed in General Musharaf's
    period. Infact they were appointed after the restoration of democracy in the country.
    The name of these judges who took oath under the constitution are as under:- 
    \     1) Mr. Justice Pervez Ali Chawla       1) Mr. Justice Habib Ullah Shakir 
    \     2) Mr. Justice Nazir Ahmed Ghazi       3) Mr. Justice Abdul Sattar Goraya 
    \     4) Mr. Justice Syed Ihtasham Qadir Shah       5) Justice Ms. Jamila Jahanoor
    Aslam       6) Mr. Justice Mahmood Akhtar Khan       7) Mr. Justice Jamshed
    Rahmat Ullah       Mr. Justice Pervez Inayat Malik       9) Mr. Justice
    Arshad Mahmood       10) Mr. Justice Irfan Qadir       11) Mr. Justice Syed
    Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari       12) Mr. Justice Ch. Naeem Masood       13) Mr.
    Justice Anwar-ul-Haq Pannu       14) Mr. Justice Muhammad Shafqat Khan Abbasi 
    \     15) Mr. Justice Imtiaz Rasheed Siddiqui       16) Mr. Justice Bin Yamin 
    \     17) Mr. Justice Khalid Ali Z. Qazi       18) Mr. Justice Salman Ansari 
    \     19) Mr. Justice Abdul Rehman Farooq Pirzada       20) Mr. Justice Abdul
    Rasheed Klwar       21) Mr. Justice Zafar Ahmed Khan Sherwani       22)
    Mr. Justice Syed Mehmood Alam Rizvi       23) Justice Ms. Soofia Latif 
    \     24) Mr. Justice Maqbool Ahmed Awan       25) Mr. Justice Safdar Ahi Bhutto 
    \     26) Mr. Justice Moharram G. Baloch       27) Mr. Justice Malik Muhammad
    Aqil       28) Mr. Justice Syed Shafaqat Ali Shah Masoomi       29) Mr.
    Justice Muhammad Iqbal Mahar       30) Mr. Justice Khadim Hussain M. Sheikh 
    \     31) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ismail Bhutto       32) Mr. Justice Arshad Siraj
    Memon       33) Mr. Justice Aamir Raza Naqvi       34) Mr. Justice Muhammad
    Karim Khan Agha       35) Mr. Justice Salman Talibuddin       36) Mr. Justice
    Shaji Rehman Khan       37) Mr. Justice Ghulam Mohayuddin Malik       38)
    Mr. Justice Ziauddin Khattak       39) Mr. Justice Syed Mussaddiq Hussain Gilani 
    \     40) Mr. Justice Syed Yahya Zahid Gilani       41) Mr. Justice Muhammad
    Alam Khan 42) Justice Mazhar Hussain Minhas 43) Justice Muhammad Ashraf
    Bhatti  44) Justice Rana Zahid Mehmood 45) Justice Kazim Ali Malik 46)
    Justice Hafiz Tariq Nasim 47) Justice Khalil Ahmad 48) Justice MA Zafar 49)
    Justice Malik Saeed Ejaz  50) Justice Syed Shaheen Masud Rizvi 51)  Justice
    Ali Akbar Qureshi   52) Justice Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon.        The aforesaid
    52 judges have never ever taken oath under the PCO. They have been ousted. The
    nation is celebrating and all the PCO judges are still continuing as judges. In
    short the fight between post November 3 PCO judges and post October 12 PCO judges
    has resulted in ouster of judges who took oath only under the Constitution of
    Pakistan and never ever under the PCO. The media, PML[N], the lawyers and other
    political forces are mixed up and are rejoicing the ouster of constitutionally
    appointed judges and PPP seems ignorant of this fact. Such things can only happen
    in Pakistan. After General Musharraf dislodged Nawaz's government
    on 12th October 1999, Iftikhar Chaudhry in order to save his job took oath under
    the PCO. However when he lost his job on 3rd of November 2007 he condemned the
    PCO. Lets stop having double standards. All PCO judges should be removed regardless
    of the fact whether they took oath under the PCO before 2nd of November 2007 or
    thereafter. The irony is that PCO judges have removed those judges who took oath
    only under the constitution and never under any PCO."

    older posts which I find are much more readable and informative than some of the
    elusive recent posts and discussions.

<p>It is time for the annual CM slumber. I may poke my nose here if something compels but, really, I have a move to plan and execute. In the meantime, you can satiate yourself on my (in)frequent shoutouts on twitter.<br />
