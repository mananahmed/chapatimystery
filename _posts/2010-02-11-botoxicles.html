  content: Le Figaro had an article titled "BHL, the most loathed dandy in France"
    a week ago. He was always a lightweight, more likely to be found on a television
    set than a scholarly conference, but since 9/11, he seems to have undergone some
    sort of radical neocon epiphany, along with his far more serious cohort Alain
    Finkielkraut. It used to be said of him that "thanks to BHL, Mrs Michu, concierge
    at Aubervilliers, 'gets' Kant". I guess not so much.

  content: I love the idea that a disgruntled research assistant planted that thing
    in his book, like a flaming bag of dogshit on the doorstep, and that they're watching
    in the bushes trying to keep their giggles under wraps.

  content: Couldn't have happened to a nicer triple-barrel-initial'd public intellectual.  VDH
    might come close, but BHL has a certain oily Francophone sheen that can't be beat.

How is it that <a href="http://timescorrespondents.typepad.com/charles_bremner/2010/02/bernardhenri-l%C3%A9vy-comes-a-cropper-with-fake-philosopher.html">it would not occur to a learned person</a> that the theoretical school of <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Botul">Botulism</a> was a hoax?</p>
