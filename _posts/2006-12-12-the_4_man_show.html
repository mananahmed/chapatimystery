  content: "You guys are stupid fools and all of your shows dont make any sense and
    are pathetic.  We need educational shows in this current time not your bullshit
    on the tv to corrupt our minds. You guys are the biggest looser and I mean it.
    This is not from any political, media or any other anger this is my personal opinion
    about you guys. Looser ! Try to do something better in life."

<p>Jon Stewart has changed television around the world. Witness, the <a href="http://www.aaj.tv/programme/index.php?pg=entertainment&pid=108">4 Man Show</a> at the AAJ channel in Pakistan. It stars 4 correspondents - three are named Khalid Butt - who are also the writers.  You can view clips from a best of....show to get a taste: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BphbQ8V8ijw">part 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgGJKiKbpIs">part 3</a> -  freakin' brilliant, esp. the ubl/musharraf and nawaz sharif/motorway segments. </p>
