  content: "Okay, wow, I am impressed and more than a little humbled that Wendy Doniger
    has taken the time and trouble to respond to what were really not very well thought
    out and rushed short comments (on my part at least, Qalander's
    comments were more thoughtful and precise than mine). I just want to say before
    I go on to try and make a more balanced outline of my criticisms; that I only
    first heard of Wendy Doniger's work on a now defunct discussion
    site &ldquo;Dialognow&rdquo; where Indians and Pakistanis
    could come and try and have a dialogue about relations between the two countries
    in the wake of the 2001 parliament attacks. Many threads obviously discussed the
    relative merits and problems of both Hinduism and Islam and one of the threads
    revolved around the contribution Wendy had made to the Encarta Encyclopaedia.
    This issue is already well known so  won't go into it here;
    all I would say is that it generated a huge amount of bitterness and controversy
    on the site with various accusations flying between those who endorsed and supported
    Wendy's article and those who had a problem with it. I was
    in the former camp and was quite astounded by some of the reactions. One colleague
    with whom I had been a regular correspondent and interlocutor for several years
    accused those of us who were defending Wendy's work of being
    patronising and I can still recall his words even though this was several years
    ago that &ldquo;the new generation of young Hindus who are growing
    up, aren't going to be embarrassed about their religion and
    won't put up with quietly while foreigners tell them what their
    religion is really meant to be like&rdquo;. This statement says many
    things but the one thing it drove home to me was, that despite my colleague and
    I being of the same age (in our 20s) coming from the same middle-class backgrounds,
    having grown up in traditional Indian families and experienced the everyday Hinduism
    that pervades such households; just how far our understanding, attitude and response
    to such issues are. There seemed to be a need to assert Hinduism and Hindu identity
    as well as an Indian national one against the interpretations or supposed attacks
    from some Other. That is the remarkable thing all these claims seem to be directed
    at some Other from whom respect, proper treatment, recognition seems to be demanded
    from: therefore we have claims that the Saraswati did exist, that Ram Sethu does
    verify the land-bridge that was constructed in the Ramayana, etc. what strikes
    me is to whom they are directed. Who are these people or entities that disrespect
    India, or bully her? Who is it that derides Hinduism as paganism or a collection
    of sham rituals with little or no real historical meaning? In other words who
    is the Other to whom such claims are addressed? The answer can shift according
    to the particular question in mind: from scholars in the Western developed world,
    to the followers of Semitic religions, to proponents of Western rationality and
    aggressive secularism to other countries such as China which seem to have overtaken
    India in the Asian continent and to the chorus of leaders from the NICs who berate
    India for being inefficient, slow, divided, unpunctual and well for being just
    India really.   In anycase I felt a sense of failure because those of us
    who defended Wendy were unable to persuade our colleagues that there was no insult
    to Hinduism being perpetrated, that multiple interpretations of religious tradition
    did allow for more than just one restrictive meaning to be placed on texts, rituals
    and practises and that our forebears in the past often did and believed in things
    very differently than we do today despite our historical connection. It is a matter
    of regret that we were unable to persuade our fellow citizens and colleagues to
    our point of view and they persisted in their arguements that led to some unnecessary
    actions. Personally speaking this marked a very big point of divergence for me
    as it forcefully reminded me of the gap that was opening up between the quietist
    and pluralist kind of Hinduism that I grew up with, that was practised by more
    than half my family who were Hindu, that was safe and secure in its own identity
    and not so uncertain and weak that it couldn't stand any external
    criticism or scrutiny but which obviously was not the kind of Hinduism that was
    shared by many others. I am glad to have this chance to interact a little with
    Wendy Doniger, however indirectly, since it allows me to express my regret and
    shame to the shabby treatment accorded to her over this whole affair, not to mention
    the subsequent harangues she has been exposed to. I feel very strongly, that this
    is an embarrassment to the tolerant and pluralist culture I come from, it is an
    embarrassment to the my country which is a secular and democratic one and finally
    it is an insult to the open-minded, generous and sacrificing brand of Hinduism
    that so many of my own family and friends have followed all their lives; they
    would not recognise their religion as it is represented some of the ideologues
    who seek to silence debate and limit inquiry.  Phew, just to respond to
    some of Wendy Doniger's points, which clarify her position
    more, I would just make some quick comments to clarify my own; since the initial
    comments were not very well-thought out at all.  I should also qualify that I
    am responding to the article and that I haven't read the book
    â€” yet! I apologise if my points seem redundant as a result
    or if they are dealt with at length in the rest of the book.  1)   I appreciate
    that Wendy contextualises the treatment meted out to Dalits and women within a
    broader framework which was obviously patriarchical and socially inegalitarian.
    It is important to note that this was not universally the case to avoid a simplified
    picture. My arguement would be though, that the Brahmanical and Vedic traditions
    were generally not able to accord these groups anywhere near a respectful status
    in society and such exceptions that occur are rare and usually in particular circumstances.
    I do think that if a more balanced picture of Hinduism is to be arrived at other
    traditions particularly tribal, tantric, bhakti, sakti, smranic and other trends
    in Hinduism that were very critical of orthodox society's treatment
    of lower caste groups and women can prove to be more fruitful. This is one reason
    why I particularly like Romila Thapar's work; she very clearly
    contrasts the worlds of the so-called Rakashas who roam free in the forests have
    their own social relations which are not characterised by polarised social stratification
    or a discriminatory attitude towards women to the more settled, conservative and
    supposedly more 'civilised' society that
    Ram and Ayodhya represent.  2) We need to understand that for most Indians
    and Hindus, it is unlikely that they will have direct access to these texts; except
    in translation and abridged form. Most of my colleagues would have like me, only
    read the popularised translations of Rajagopalchari as teenagers and the Amar
    Chitra Katha comics as children and stopped there. A few would go on to learn
    to read the Gita and various prayers in Sanskrit but that is about all. Today
    obviously films, television serials and other popular media are far more influential
    in disseminating ideas about such epics and their interpretation is invariably
    very much an orthodox one. I was horrified a few months ago to pick up a children's
    book that serialised the Mahabharata to look at the episode of Ekalavaya that
    held him up as a role model to be followed and that glossed completely over the
    injustices involved. The selective drawings upon tradition that are made overwhelmingly
    favour one reading over another and the orthodox interpretations here have a hegemonic
    hold over the imagination of many.  3)  Even if we admit the varied nature
    of these texts; the voices that are silenced within them are deafening by their
    absence. Now, having a knowledge and having spent time with adivasi communities
    in central and northern India; it is difficult not to read episodes like Ram's
    killing of Tataka and Vali as very one-sided in their representation. For the
    forest-dwelling communities and tribes the story much have been very different;
    a point Ajay Skaria makes well in his work &ldquo;Hybrid Histories&rdquo;
    where such episodes come off as instances of almost ethnic cleansing. It is difficult
    to see this from other points of view; but just as one is used to seeing the old
    Western classics such as &ldquo;The Searchers&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Stagecoach&rdquo; whereby the intrusion of European
    settlers was always seen as a naturalised extension of the existing order which
    was resisted by Amerindian unprovoked violence; a view which later even their
    architects of these films like John Ford came to repudiate and recant and attempt
    to tell the story from the perspective of the Amerindians; a similar dissonance
    exists. -  in this context, since I discussed films at length with Qalander on
    the previous thread, I must mention the uncomfortable casteist undercurrent to
    the Hindi film &ldquo;Ekalayva&rdquo; where Amitabh Bachchan's
    character plays the eponymous hero, who is a loyal and sacrificing bodyguard to
    a Rajput royal family â€” the implications of service and sacrifice
    are clear as is who is meant to be doing the serving and the sacrificing and who
    benefits from these actions. I can't also help but be reminded
    of Sita's own kidnapping and the startling discovery that Susan
    Faludi made about many kidnapped women who were abducted by Amerindians, and who
    either rescued themselves or chose to stay and live with their captors having
    found a role or made relationships that they were unwilling to abandon to return
    to White settler society â€” a point she captures well in a quote
    from Benjamin Franklin who remarked upon the phenomenon of how many of these women
    were so reluctant to return during the events of Metacom's
    war. Similarly, our religious narrative is so partial and one-sided; if we choose
    to rely on these few select texts which are very much the work of 'male
    Brahmins' (notwithstanding recent attempts to claim that Valmiki
    was a bhangi).  4) The small point about the dog-Dalit metaphor; I was unaware
    that it came from elsewhere in the Mahabharata; in this the article is a little
    misleading since it mentions the incident of dogs being permitted to enter heaven;
    which I assume is a reference to Yudhishtar's ascent to swarga
    accompanied by Dharma incarnated as the faithful dog (even here it should be noted,
    the dog actually doesn't &ldquo;enter&rdquo;
    heaven but transmutates to Dharma's original form, having tested
    Yudhistar's loyalty and been satisfied)."

  content: "Yes I can understand your sympathy Wendy. it is  same that lot of people
    feel  for Jews, Blacks ,Witches,  Pagans . There are  various  examples which
    can be quoted   here to prove that the Hindu belief system had  enough  maturity
    to  fight   and raise  its  voice  against   caste system    There  are many
    examples   and   Sage Valmiki is one , who from his humble lower caste origin
    \ grew up to become  a revered sage  Bhakta Prahlad says to Lord Narsimham
    that a chandal who has God in his heart is better than a Brahmin who knows the
    twelve yogas.  Lord Ram eats the jhoota bair of the bhilini Sabri.  in Bhagavad-gita
    (4.13) Lord Krishna says, \"According to the three modes of material nature and
    the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by
    Me.\" Then He continues, \"Brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras are distinguished
    by their qualities of work in accordance with the modes of nature.\" (Bg.18.41)
    Herein we can see that there is no mention of birth as a determining factor for
    one's varna or classification. They are ascertained by their qualities of work.
    Furthermore, \"By following his qualities of work, every man can become perfect.
    . . By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading,
    man can, in the performance of his own duty [or occupation], attain perfection.\"
    (Bg.18.45-6) Now the question is, is caste a religious problem attributed to
    a belief system or a social problem of a society in a  different time. ?   Well
    I can understand you have your  answer ready .  A  rebelious Bhakti Movement
    \ contributed in its own way to  raise its  voice   for reformation .In the Marathi
    area, in the fourteenth century, Cokhamela and his family, wife, sister, sister's
    husband, and son, all wrote songs of both bliss and humiliation, over four hundred
    of which are now credited to them. In the North, Ravidas, a Chamar of the fifteenth
    century, is still very influential as model, source of pride, and symbol of identity.
    all the untouchable saints are remembered&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;their legends told,
    their songs sung, and their places secured by proof of creativity and piety. As
    for your perception about the metaphors for  dog I will quote  an incident  from
    the Life of Adiguru Shankacharya . on his way to the Vishwanath mandir for
    Mahadev's darshan, Shankar politely requested a raggedly dressed chandal (low
    caste man) with four dogs to move aside. The man replied whether he should move
    the body or the atma? \"If it is the body, your body and mine are of the same
    composition, of flesh, blood and bones. If it is the atma, then the atma is the
    same in everyone.\" This reply startled Shankar. He realised that this man was
    none other than Shiv himself and the four dogs were the four Vedas. He prostrated
    instantly. He expressed his divine experience - sakshatkar - of Vishwanath by
    composing a pentad verse known as Manish Panchakam. When he raised his head, the
    chandal and the dogs had vanished!  Hindu themselves  banned the  caste
    \ system  after independence  shows   the maturity  of  this  thought process
    . However  some people  still  use the Old  history to judge the changed  present"

  content: "Wow, sepoy, you really ca arrange anything :-)  Thank you Conrad
    and Ms. Donger for taking the time for these responses -- I can especially empathize
    with Conrad's sentiments at being unable to persuade people that academic scholarship
    did not constitute an attack on Hinduism.  I have myself faced this sort of problem
    in my personal life, trying to convince a few people of my acquaintance (I have
    the double problem of also having to convince some Muslims of my acquaintance
    that the commandeering of history in the service of a Hindutva agenda does not
    mean that the opposite - namely that a \"whitewash\" of medieval \"Muslim history\"
    -- is appropriate), hence could really relate to the heartburn this leads to.
    \ [This sort of disconnect also reminds me that for all my sympathy for post-structuralism/Derrida/Foucault
    etc., the old habits/reflexes -- namely that language is open/transparent/a means
    of communication -- die hard.]  Re: \"I must mention the uncomfortable casteist
    undercurrent to the Hindi film &ldquo;Ekalayva&rdquo; where
    Amitabh Bachchan's character plays the eponymous hero, who
    is a loyal and sacrificing bodyguard to a Rajput royal family â€”

    the serving and the sacrificing and who benefits from these actions.\"  Superb
    example, and completely agree -- but, while Vinod Chopra doesn't execute the film
    very well, you omitted to mention the subversion here (for those who haven't seen
    the film, spoiler alert): by film's end, the whole symbolism of Rajput patriarchy
    has been turned on its head, with the royal having been revealed as impotent,
    and the subservient servant the real father who, by impregnating the queen, continues
    the royal bloodline.  The royal house in this film lives in a ghostly palace that
    seems like nothing so much as an anachronism, and the message is clear: India
    after the maharajahs belongs to Eklavya, not to the royals he serves.  Lest anyone
    think I am reading too much into this, consider Sanjay Dutt's brief cameo in the
    film: he is the \"lower caste\" cop who is investigating the murder at the palace,
    and his sneering demeanor towards the royals, his refusal to give them any deference,
    is in marked contrast to the attitude of Amitabh's Eklavya.  And his only \"hero\"
    at the palace is the lower-caste Eklavya -- NOT any of the royals  (memorably
    illustrated by a dialogue that is unusually blunt for a multiplex-friendly Hindi
    film: \"Agar Eklavya-baba nahin hote na, to is haveli ki taraf mooth-ta bhi nahin\"
    (\"If it weren' for Eklavya, I wouldn't even piss in the direction of this mansion\"))."

  content: "Re: \"Hindu themselves banned the caste system after independence shows
    the maturity of this thought process .\"  The problem is that the Hindu
    right uniformly resisted the attempts of Nehru, Ambedkar, etc. to revise the legal
    implications of Hinduism (witness the large protests and agitations over the Hindu
    Marriage Act, and so on).  This double move is not an unfamiliar one: on the one
    hand Nehru was and is castigated for being a \"Westernized\" and hence alien fellow
    who \"targeted\" Hinduism; on the other hand, everyone should pat their backs
    for having had it rammed down their throats!  Can't have one's cake and eat it
    too.  Raj: i think you know full well that Hindus are not being compared
    to Nazis here; this is really the worst kind of cheap shot: the point, if one
    re-reads the comment, is precisely the opposite: Doniger is saying that if we
    only went by \"the majority-view\", the authorized texts/authorized interpretations
    of the authorized texts, the \"official discourse\", we would have to say that
    it is pointless speaking of any Germans who resisted Nazism; i.e. one cannot ignore
    the marginal, the \"little\", the liminal, the \"zara hatke\", the woman we see
    only when we squint a little -- in these cracks may rebellion, and the promise
    of a better tomorrow, be found."

    mansion&rdquo;)).</i>  Great response and I don't
    want to turn this thread into another filmi discussion on politics and sociology
    â€” ok who am I kidding of course I do!!! Well, I see you
    points though I would not quite see the movie this way. Eklavya's
    role is key in propping up the decaying feudalism of the Rajput royal family here
    true, but it is still effaced and he acts very much as the loyal retainer who
    is peripherally recognised for his services. The only departure here is that his
    martial prowress and skill have received public acclaim through popular recognition
    and ballads. There is still an air of feudal nostalgia here in the trappings of
    the royal estate and while the air of decay is both visually and narratively shown;
    it harks back to a past when this wasn't clearly the case (though
    given that Eklavya's family have served for 9 generations we
    don't know what conditions were really like then and whether
    the earlier generations of Royals were any better). The shift in portrayal of
    the feudal zamindar or royalty is imo a function of the declining popularity of
    this character as a viable centre for the audiences' affections
    or hopes. This figure still functions in the background and we can see the shift
    in the 1970s with the role of the armless Thakur beating Gabbar in Sholay to the
    more limited roles such figures play in today's movies â€”
    as in Aaja Nachle, where the local Raja has turned politician and is voted from
    the constituency off the back of the popular vote in a democracy rather than relying
    on his subjects consent in a feudalistic relationship. Unlike propping up the
    old order, this neo-feudal brand of politician is a moderniser who plan is to
    bring &ldquo;development&rdquo; in the form of a mall to
    replace the Ajanta theatre under threat. However, he generously offers a deal
    to Madhuri Dixit to see if she can save the theatre by testing the popular support
    for it through a dance event and then benevolently instructs the police not to
    get involved in the dispute between the townsfolk that ensues between those who
    support and oppose the idea but to &ldquo;let the people decide.&rdquo;
    And the normal course of events to take place. This speaks to an overarching desire
    for the traditional feudal elite to resume a sort of guardianship role, but in
    the post-Emergency era to merely ensure that the different political factions
    don't get out hand but abide by the &ldquo;rules
    of the game&rdquo; and settle their dispute through an open popular
    contest (read election).  All this speaks to a desire for forms of traditional
    political authority to manage the architecture of democracy, while of course ignoring
    their own past role in suppressing it and exploiting their exalted position; but
    combines it with a recognition that in the new era of downward assertion of power
    by previously subsmissive social groups and the widening of social democracy that
    the old hierarchies are no longer sustainable in their previous form. Such films
    incorporate elements of subversion and democracy imo; without fully giving over
    to the logic of it and distorting the past into an idealised version of a socially
    hierarchical utopia. What has gone wrong is the process of political change has
    transformed old relationships (as in Aaja Nachle) or individual decay at the level
    of the family has eroded what should have been a functioning and ideal-type social
    arrangement (Eklavya).  I see the Sanjay Dutt character in the latter film,
    slightly differently, in the way that I frequently hear my upper caste colleagues
    mutter in private about the attitudes of jumped officers from lower caste communities
    who don't know how to behave. There is the accompanying bourgeois
    criticism of reservation based on the old 'merit'

  content: "Just to add one more point about Eklavya about which I am being a bit
    harsh; it would be nice to see a subaltern character like Eklavaya portrayed without
    some sort of disability for once; after the ppainful scenes with Bachcu in Laagan,
    I thought this wouldn't happen again. It is as if the upper caste sensibility
    can't cope with a physcially assertive, virile subaltern body in the main character.
    Much is made of Eklayvaya' marksmanhship, though it is never allowed to assume
    central stage because of his partial blindness (crucially this is one reason why
    the killers of his master can't be prosecuted since sigh-affected witnesses lack
    credibility). It is as if just like Arjun in the Mahabharata we can't bear the
    presence of a subaltern who has acheived such a level of mastery - in this case
    of weapons; without qualifiying it somehow.  On the plus side the ending
    does contain one of the few scenes of wealth distribution you will see on a grand
    scale legitimated by the film's plot :D"

  content: "I think that on Aaja Nachle, what you miss is that the film is very much
    on the \"side\" of Madhuri Dixit, NOT of Akshaye Khanna's ex-raja character.  Not
    that there is anything \"subaltern\" about that -- it seems to me that the film
    comes down on the \"side\" of the \"modern\", individualistic woman -- i.e. she
    is a stand-in for \"us\" (as the multiplex audience would imagine itself), and
    arrayed against her is both \"the tradition\" and the modern nabobs of the business
    world (the subaltern is basically absent).  On the bright side is the fact that
    the Dixit character is clearly conscious of the fact that right-wing \"guardians
    of culture\" in the film aren't \"traditionalists\" -- the film has more than
    one dialogue where Dixit expresses surprise at how things have changed, and how
    \"in the old days\" the town simply had a lot more time for the arts, there was
    less moral policing, etc. (on the dishonest side is the typical multiplex film
    squeamishness about ideology: thus politicians are presented as good or bad not
    because of their ideology but based on whether or not they are corrupt, a \"they
    are all the same\" cynicism that is really moral obtuseness masquerading as cynicism.
    \ In Aaja Nachle, for instance, the right-wing politician has a Muslim goon (Kunal
    Kapoor); being familiar with Hyderabad, there is of course no shortage of Muslim
    political goons, but not in the service of this sort of political agenda -- the
    aim is clearly to de-fang the representation).  I do not disagree with your general
    point re: feudals, but think you have the wrong target in Aaja Nachle.  In fact
    one of the good things about this film was how it showed corporate tycoons in
    a less than halo-rimmed light; ever since the economic liberalization of 1991,
    the trend has increasingly been toward the transformation of the industrialist
    into the true Contemporary Indian Hero; that is not really so in Aaja Nachle (aside:
    from a gender perspective, this is also one of the few films that shows the woman
    \"defeating\" the man in the final analysis. Despite the re-inscription of the
    two into an economy of romance by film's end, that is worth noting).  I
    certainly did not \"read\" Sanjubaba's representation in Eklavya the same way
    -- in fact at my theater his were the only dialogs that drew hoots and whistles;
    given the long tradition of Hindi film \"herogiri\", IMO the audience was clearly
    not meant to understand this character in a patronizing sort of way."

  content: "No I agree with you about the main thrust of the film which was pleasingly
    free from the usual easy endings and rarely we see the heroine ( a single mum
    no less!!) come up trumps. My comments were really about the sub-plots with ref
    to the local MP and it doesn't condone feudal politics in the same way at all.
    I am not as confident about any critique of the neo-liberalisation wave though,
    since there isn't any really critique of the kind of 'development' that AK's character
    was meant to be brining; it is simply rejected by popular acclaim. As a side note
    I liked the up-ending of the traditionalists in the film but was amused that with
    my friend we took his wife's younger sisters with us but they asked us not to
    tell their parents that we were going to see this film since they said their parents
    may not approve about seeing a film with the Laila Manju story :D!!!!!  I
    missed the Hyderbadi connection, now that you mention it. There was of course
    the unecessary brouhaha over the supposed casteism in the lyrics there as well
    which was a pointless controversy. The soundtrack is good, I remember absrudly
    long discussions that used to take place during long distance journeys in train
    compartments over them and the performance of Dixit and her dancing!   <i>I

    think you are right but it depends on who you saw it with I suppose and the composition
    of the audience. The bit where Irani boasts about a 2,000 year history of royalty
    countered by the counter-claim of 5,000 years of servitude which it was built
    on by Sanjay Dutt's character has clear parallels with the ongoing turmoil over
    caste and the transfer of power in what Jaffrelot and Srinivas have called the
    'Silent Revolution' from the upper castes to the OBCs and Dalits. An upper caste
    audience collectively unless they are a-typically progressive won't regard this
    as a benign development."

    we aren't idiots, no one is using these films to analyse ancient texts - that
    would be imbecilic; what we are doing to saying how popular understandings and

    audience. Few of us have even read the originals in translation; apart from scholars
    - which I would venture to add don't include Rajiv, have the linguistic skills
    or historical training to study these ancient texts in their original language.

  content: "I'm not propagating anything so please don't jump to unwarranted conclusions
    as I appear to have done in my observations regarding the usage of Bollywood metaphors.
       \"Genuine\" refers to academicians and scholars who are not the Mandir-wallahs
    nor Marxists nor Macaulayites (nor Mullahs nor Missionaries. Collectively, the
    5Ms).  The JNU academics you refer to are well known to have strong Marxist views
    with its theories of class and social discrimination. In other words, not unbiased.
    \"Indian\" refers to those who (attempt t) appreciate and understand Indian history,
    traditions and civilisational ethos of India - the philospophies and teachings
    and practices.  For this to happen, living and travelling within India for significant
    periods is important - it is hard to be a drive-by/flying-visit historian in such
    cases.  There are hardly any historians, social scientists, anthropologists
    etc in India who can read or speak Sanskrit/Pali/local languages to do any primary
    research. For example, William Dalrymple commented on the lack of Persian knowledge
    (while writing The Last Mughal) amongst Indian historians who were \"experts\"
    on the Mughal era. They are therefore dependent on the interpretations of others
    who in most cases are neither \"genuine\" nor \"Indian\".  Again, I draw
    attention to Raj's observations of March 21st.  These and many other examples
    need to be understood as well before jumping to \"unwarranted conclusions\" .
    For that to happen, one must have an open mind.  The culture of great debates
    that took place in early India (eg. \"The Argumentative Indian\" Amartya Sen is
    a recent book that also refers to this)  has been lost.  We are willing to jump
    to \"unwarranted conclusions\" because of the arrogance of our ignorance.  One
    must have the strength to acknowledge the faults, the humility to learn and the
    courage of conviction not to be swayed by each and every argument.  For that,
    one must equip oneself with knowledge that comes from multiple sources and reach
    one's own conclusions. Not parrot what someone else says.    In closing,
    I submit the article linked below for your reading.  http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20090318&amp;fname=sugata&amp;sid=1  Thank

    rubbish in my life. Dalrymple should stick to writing his waffly travelogues imo
    and not talk about matters he knows little about. ALL the historians I cited have
    knowledge about the original languages used in their period and they ALL translated
    themselves from the ORIGINALS. You seem to be labouring under the illusion to
    become a historian all one needs to do is consult some secondary sources; I am
    sorry to disabuse you but a knowledge of languages is a requirement for any academic
    historian of the period he is studying Ancient or modern. Any ancient historian
    would certainly need to know the languages of the documents he/she is consulting;
    this is the case with both Jha and Thapar. The latter in particular would not
    have had her work stand up to academic scrutiny if this was the case; even critics
    of her work like David Lorenzen and Michael Trautmann would'nt
    claim this. I can personally add that having studied under a non-Marxist historian,
    Tapan Raychaudhuri that many historian of Mughal India do know Persian, including
    Marxists like Irfan Habib whose work on agrarian crisis is a classic on the subject.
    I am at a loss where accusations of ignorance of Persian come from here. I don't
    know who Dalrymple is referring to. It is amusing that you cite an article relying
    on Sheldon Pollock's arguement; since Pollock is an individual
    who would not make the criticisms or claims you have made about many of the historians
    cited, even though he may disagree with their work and his claims about the popularity
    of Ram as a figure and the politicised influence of the Ramayana from the 12th
    century onwards is hardly one that traditional adherent of the &ldquo;glory
    of Indian culture&rdquo; are going to be happy with."

    so didn't know that. I would note that unlike what Jay asserted the 1857 war can
    hardly come under the purview of Mughal history, since we have already entered
    the colonial era. Anyone who studies the Mughal period  especially before the
    mid-17th century can't do so without understanding Persian since most of the primary
    documents are written in this language. Even today, much of the land revenue basis,
    systems of measure and terminology at the village level draw heavily upon the
    systemised framework put in place by the Mughals an Sher Shaha and so are explicitly
    PErsian in origin - as an aside their indecipherability to non-specialists is
    one reason why revenue officials who do know the system can extract such huge
    rents from interpreting/altering the records.

  content: These appear to be vintage texts from the Raj-era; I don't think anyone
    is denying the "Orientalist"/racist underpinnings of much Raj-era historiography.  But
    it is sloppy to slip from the latter to contemporary academics.  I certainly don't
    believe in the existence of anything like "neutrality", but that is a separate
    issue from impugning someone's good faith.  And secondly, it is reductive in the
    extreme to posit a racial/cultural identity as the "truth" that must necessarily
    underlie one's agenda; stated differently, recognition that "neutrality" is no
    longer a philosophically tenable concept does not mean that one is at liberty
    to shoehorn people based on notions of "nativity" and "authenticity."  For if
    notions of neutrality/academic "detachment" can be de-constructed (and they certainly
    can), so too can notions of cultural authenticity, "national spirit", etc.

    view and purpose  and also to high light that  Historian  has to rise above his
    prejudice towards an ideology to judge the facts . As Albert Einstein  one  said
    \"A theory shall not contradict the empirical facts\""

  content: Raj - I understand now what you wanted to convey.I would say though that
    no one today would seriously adopt the world view of people like Muller who has
    been heavily criticised as an Orientalist. Mueller in anycase, was a philologist
    not a historian. The view of Indian history today is far removed from people like
    RC Majumdar and RP Dutt; never mind older Orientalists like Mueller and his brethren.

    the underlying contempt you seem to have for Hindus, Hinduism, and any defender

    Ambedkar's reforms is baseless (unless your definition of \"Hindu right\" happens

  content: "Wendy is trying to potray that caste system as an evil and this is her
    fallacy.  The problem with caste system has only been in implementation.  The
    caste system was meant to be a division of society on the basis of personal qualites
    and not by the heredity.  Any person who wanted to fight and be a warrior
    and interested in physical strength were classified as a Kshatriya.  Any
    person who was in the quest for knowledge of the self was classified as Brahman.  Any
    person who was interested in acquiring name and fame either by skilled labour
    and acquiring wealth  was classified as Vaishya.  Any person who did not
    want to do any of the above was a Shudra.  Each classification has a set
    of rules and regulations that allowed people with similar interests to get together
    and improve themselves. For Eg. a Brahman who is in search of knowledge should
    be able to resist pleasures of sense like taste and is therfore not allowed to
    eat tasty food (non vegetarian), consume alcohol etc. a brahman was not was granted
    food since they were not interested in acquiring wealth. In return for food, the
    brahmans were required to spread the knowledge that they felt would help the society.
    You can read THE LAWS OF MANU. 1500 BC translated by G. Buhler for the rules and
    regulations for each class.  Why do you think sportsmen want to compete
    with best in their game? it is the same thing. Here the system affords an opportunity
    for self growth. Otherwise a person who is interested in skilled labour would
    be forced to acquire knowledge which is not good for the society.  On that
    basis the Varna System, allowed people to identify themselves and classify themselves
    based on their interests.  It is people with half baked knowledge who created
    an impression that any class was lower.   In reality the whole system was
    made to look evil by these half baked knowledge of so called analysts/reformists
    who could not fight out on the basis of knowledge. The non-hindu preachers and
    foreign missionaries started their evil campaign of spreading hatered towards
    other religions.  I hardly come to understand why these so called preachers
    are intolerant of other religions. They used the classic policy of \"DIVIDE AND
    RULE\" to create problems within people who lived happliy.  But I am sure
    that the fundamental religion of ever human being atleast in this 21st century
    is the religion of love and compassion.  Hate mongers who preach hatred
    and talk lowly and find fault with other are not spiritual people but politicians.
    They cannot proceed further in quest for knowledge because knowledge transcends
    religion.  If i can most humbly submit: The first step to seeking true knowledge
    is to turn inwards and find fault with yourself rather than with others.  People
    like ramanuja, christ and aristotle have failed to make their message of \"love
    and compassion\"  Today how many people who call youself christians and
    talk slyly and insult other religions practice love and compassion.   Wendy
    would be better off preaching love and compassion rather than preaching hatered.  May
    love and compassion prevail. May the truth of knowledge clear the darkness of
    hatered in these souls.   people who insult  other religions under the name
    of christ is shameful to say the least because it was christ who preached love
    and compassion."

<p><em>Wendy Doniger has graciously, and generously, agreed to respond to some of the comments at CM. I thank her.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have followed with great interest the conversation between Conrad Barwa and Qalandar on this website, and the first thing I want to say is how grateful I am for the reasoned, intelligent tone of both sets of comments.  It is an enormous relief to be able to eavesdrop on a real argument instead of the mindless attacks to which I am so often subjected.   And several of the comments on the Chapati Mystery blog have made me want to get into the conversation too.</p>
<p> I would particularly like to comment on the argument that the cases I cite, of concern for and sympathy with the lower castes, are just a few rare instances, not characteristic of Hinduism as a whole. This is indeed true, and, yes, I did fish them out, the way people who do not just want to say that all the Germans were Nazis fished out people like Schindler and the other "righteous Christians" who were heroes; the fact remains that many Germans, perhaps even most Germans, were Nazis. So too, without apologizing for Hindu attitudes to women and the lower castes, I wanted to lift up a few counter-instances to show that you cannot simply condemn Hinduism outright, as so many Americans want to do, for the cases that always hit the newspapers, of atrocities to Dalits and women. The balance here becomes clearer if you read the whole book, which does set these liberal, hopeful instances against the backdrop of heavy prejudice against women and Dalits. Indeed, what makes the counter cases so heroic is precisely that they are fighting against a powerful culture of oppression.  </p>
<p>I try to read the Mahabharata story of Ekalavya as one of very mixed feelings, justifying the caste system even while it raises serious questions about its justice.  And, yes, the Dalits today have a problem with Eklavya, and that is in the book, in another chapter, that shows how Dalits in recent years have still used Eklavya but in another way, to say, No, I would not have given them my thumb! So that balance, too, would be more apparent if you read the whole book. There's a limit to what you can do in 1,000 words; the damn book is 779 pages long!</p>
<p>A few small points: &acirc;&euro;&uml;<br />
I take the dog-Dalit metaphor not from the tales of Ekalavya or Yudhishthira but from other texts, such as a story in the Mahabharata [12.115-119] in which a dog wants to be more than a dog and is transformed into a lion and becomes horrible and has to be turned back into a dog. Other stories too. But then I try to read them back into stories in which it is less obvious that they stand for Dalits, but I think they do. I'm not sure they do, but I think they do; I think it's a fair possible reading.</p>
<p>As for Witzel's criticisms of my Sanskrit translations, I think it stems from his misunderstanding of the sorts of liberties I took for the Penguin Classic translation of the Rig Veda, where I couldn't use a lot of footnotes and so had to smooth out a lot of lines in ways that did in fact take me farther from the literal meanings of the words than I would have allowed myself to go were I trying to produce the sort of academic translations that Witzel is looking for. But that really has nothing to do with the issues here. Nor does the criticism that I only translate the ordinary Sanskrit texts that everyone else translates. I wrote a whole (if small) book about the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OvqeAAAACAAJ">Jaiminiya Brahmana</a>, a much ignored text, and both the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dnfZ_MBErlQC">Shiva</a> book and the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C">Evil</a> book cite lots of obscure Puranas that have never been translated (or hadn't been in the 70's, when I wrote those books).  But of course I work on the central texts that other people work on too.</p>
<p>As for the old criticism that I write about sex, look at my <a href="http://divinity.uchicago.edu/faculty/doniger_cv.pdf">CV</a> sometime. I've written about 30 books altogether, and about 5 of them deal with sexual issues. </p>
<p>Draupadi ah yes, I'd love to talk about Draupadi.  There is a LOT about Draupadi in the book. But really you have to read the book . . .
