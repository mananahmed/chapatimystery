  content: "Prof Cole continues to miss the boat on Pakistan.  There is a struggle
    going on in Pakistan to find the right balance of stability, democracy and the
    rule of law.  Professor Cole, Musharraf, Obama and many Pakistanis are fixated
    on stability and miss out on how important rule of law is.  He also seems
    to think that PML-N is more feudal than the Zardari alliance, or that there is
    something left about the Zardari alliance."

  content: "Awesome video Sepoy - I thought you were kidding and it was a pastiche
    till I googled it off stratpost! Incroyable as the French would say!!!!  Course
    Rafael should have gone the whole hog and got at least a dozen extra's, with Hrithik
    Roshan and Priyanka Chopra to play the lead roles. That would have been really
    \"going Bollywood\" as it is this is just Bollywood-lite. Even the b-grade 70s
    Bollywood movies weren't that bad.  And is it me, or does the whole thing
    look like an old Indian advert for Neem toothpaste; that SAM in the middle looks
    suspiciously like a giant tube of toothpaste as well :D"

  content: I am using a satellite connection of a hospital close to Muzaffarabad.  I
    guess the company through which the internet connection is provided has registered
    the connection as if it was in Iran to possibly circumvent the red tape of registration
    in Pakistan.  Still strange though why Juan Cole's site would be filtered.

<p>The Long March is destined to begin in less than 48 hours. I was hoping to have done more, much more, in talking about it, but things have been hectic on the academic front. So, let me just forward you to <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2009/03/pakistan-political-crisis-deepens.html">Juan Cole</a> for some breakdown (I don't really agree that this is partition-time. or just not yet). Me, all I can offer you is this amazing corporate video. See. I am no pundit.</p>
