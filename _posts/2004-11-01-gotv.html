    Sorry, I'm not a citizen so I can't vote. But it's not fair though. Maybe just few hundred people in Ohio or Florida will decide the fate of the rest of the world. Where as us in the Middle East have to bear the effects of US policy almost as much as US citizens.

    Somehow I feel the world will have to reorganize itself and throw out the Nation State system if we want to really be able to claim democracy. Hmmm... but I'm not holding my breath.

    something about democracy as well. \nbtw, do read the short piece by Eric Hobsbawm
    I have linked below. Age of Nationalism will end soon, enough."

<p><img src="/img/gotv.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>A chinese non-citizen friend is in Michigan driving people to vote. A indian non-citizen friend is in Missouri. Numerous first time "activist" friends are in Ohio. A dozen of us from Chicago will be in Milwaukee tomorrow. This is grand, this is momentous. I don't necessarily know what it means. If Kerry wins, will we all go back to hip observors? If Bush wins, will we come un-glued? Actually, I was asked by Salon.com, what will I do if Bush wins. My <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/30/unthinkable/index2.html">reply</a>. Special thanks to Katherine Mieszkowski for contacting me for the story.<br />

Most of my readership is from the Sultunate of Brunei but, in case you are reading this and are eligible to vote tomorrow: Your polling place: <a href="http://www.mypollingplace.com">www.mypollingplace.com</a>. Or call 1-866-MYVOTE1. More details <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/01/opinion/01mon1.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/11/01/pakistan.musharraf.reut/index.html">things</a> happening elsewhere. But I haven't the time or mind to pay attention. </p>
<p>One more thing. Tomorrow when Tim Russert brings out his whiteboard and Tom Brokaw looks askance and Wolf Blitzer howls and Dan Rather (is he still around?) spuns Texan homilies, remember that the damn pundits don't know jack and that every vote must get counted.<br />
