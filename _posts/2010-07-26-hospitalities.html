    2007:  \"To test the new communications, COL Qaiser requested that we order
    a pizza from Pizza Hut in Peshawar and that his Commander would ensure its hot
    delivery within an hour plus. Well take him up on it in the near future.\""

<p><em>I will update this with other hospitalities in the war zone as I encounter more data points. Others please contribute.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Following the formal discussion, they set a table of finger foods and chi [sic]. We continued to talk discussing more personal histories and the two officers were very open and candid. We took a group photo (they had taken several of us already while we were sitting there) and then left the way we came.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Pakmil were very hospitable, they were on time at the border and transported the party to Chaman Fort without event. At the fort they provided light refreshment with snacks and curry lunch with music post meeting.

<blockquote><p>Atmospherics: (reception of HCA, reactions to ANSF and Coalition forces, etc): All villagers/elders were extremely pleased with the products that we gave to them along. Only the elder didnt want his village taking the products. He personally blamed George Bush for his AK-47 being taken from him. He doesnt want us to give stuff to his village because of fear from the enemy punishing him. He did say he would take money though. Only about 6 kids came out to get stuff. We gave some stuff for the women of the village too.</p></blockquote>
