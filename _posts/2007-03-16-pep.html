  content: Having worked in Pakistan in the mid-198s, the article about the work of
    Kenneth Rehage took on special meaning for me. That part of India which is now
    Pakistan was home for me as a kid and I grew up speaking Urdu. Returning later
    as a consultant for a World Bank Agricultural Education Program, I did not meet
    any of the 5000 teachers trained under that program. Have follow-up studies been
    done to trace the impact of that long-term project? Do Pakistani educational archives
    speak of it? Two articles about women and development and women's literacy were
    published by Dr. Lily Chu and myself in the late 1980's however our bibliographies
    did not include references to the Pakistan Project. If more is found, I would
    be interested to know. Harold M. Bergsma, Professor Emeritus, International Development

    aspects of the education which needed a change, and the major concern that is
    quality education.  The question that arises in our mind is \"Are These
    Organizations delivering quality education\"? Why does country like Pakistan,
    which is underdeveloped, have double standards (of education)? What about those
    students whose parents cannot afford heavy fees of private schools? Is it not
    the right of every child to have quality education and equal opportunity for the
    future?  We know that it is not easy to revolutionize mindsets but we believe

<p>In 1957, Francis S. Chase, the founding Dean of the Graduate School of Education, established at the University of Chicago the "Pakistan Education Project" with support from the Ford Foundation. The purpose of the project was to improve education through teacher-training programs at extension centers in what was then East and West Pakistan and to improve facilities for students at those university campuses.</p>
<p>The program led to the establishment of 43 pilot secondary schools and new educational centers were organized at the University of Dhaka and Punjab University. More than 5,000 teachers and administrators were trained in the Pakistan Education Project with many Pakistani teachers coming to Chicago for their training.</p>
<p>From 1963 - 1973, this project was directed by Kenneth Rehage, who travelled extensively to Pakistan. He also directed the University's Peace Corps Training Program for Pakistan in 1963. </p>
<p>Kenneth Rehage, Professor Emeritus in Education and a celebrated teacher, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/254620,CST-NWS-XREHA13.article">passed away</a> this January. He was 96. </p>
<p>I will try and find out more about the Pakistan Education Project. Not many details are available online - though, a dissertation was written on it in 1962 by Alan Peshkin. But I will note this: In a report Kenneth Rehage wrote for the <i>Elementary School Journal</i> in 1958, I was struck by these words: "The influence of Sputnik was keenly felt at this conference." The conference was on the future of high school education in America and Pakistan. Think about it.</p>
