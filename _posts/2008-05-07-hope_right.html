  content: Awesome.  Brings back fond memories of attending <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=199007010CHA"
    rel="nofollow">this game</a> at the old Comiskey.  There's absolutely nothing
    like seeing a Yankee pitcher throw a no-hitter on the road -- and lose 4-0.

  content: "Cool. This is what makes baseball great, really.   Magical moments.  I've
    never gotten to see anything even close to a no-hitter live. But that's OK: hope
    is alive."

    over by the second at-bat.

  content: We were a mile away when buehrle wrapped up his no-hitter, unfortunately
    we didn't get to go to that game because we overdid the one-hitter. Laziness doesn't
    get the job done, but at least you get to watch.

<p>By the end of the 7th inning, it was clear to everyone that Gavin Floyd was pitching a no-hitter. A no-hitter with a run, no less.</p>

<p>At the top of the ninth, he took the mound to a standing ovation. And stood there, alone, throwing pitches.</p>

<p>See, earlier that day, I had wanted to go to my first ball game of this season. So, I emailed the usual suspects and lo and behold raver comes up with these awesome free tickets. Providence, you know. It was utterly beautiful at the park. The sky cleared up - the breeze - the game. After months in the darkness of Chicago's coldest winter, I felt as if I had lungs to breathe. </p>
<p>And suddenly this good, nay pretty great night, was about to enter legendary status. I could witness a no-hitter. </p>
<p>The human mind is a funny thing. Well, mine is. I stood there, clapping and hollering, and wishing, wishing more than anything I have wished for, that Gavin would get this no-hitter. I wanted it for him. I wanted it because if it happened, it would be a sign. A clear indication that the impossibilities amassed on my shoulders could dissipate. Hope, right. </p>
<p>That moment, at the top of the ninth, with one out - that was a great moment. That's what sports can do for you - give you air for your lungs.</p>
