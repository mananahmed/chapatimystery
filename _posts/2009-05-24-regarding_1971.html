  content: This is moving and heartening.  As many of you are no doubt aware, last
    December a group of Turkish academics, activists, writers, and public figures
    published a similar statement on the Armenian genocide, although they shied away
    from using the g-word itself (in contrast to the detailed and forceful APP statement).  The
    <a href="http://www.ozurdiliyoruz.com/" rel="nofollow">&Atilde;&ndash;z&Atilde;&frac14;r
    Diliyoruz</a> ("We Apologize") campaign they launched has garnered nearly 30,000
    signatures since (and a certain amount of flak in both Turkey &amp; Armenia, though
    less than I might have expected in the former).  While I am skeptical about the
    political games that get played around the official recognition issue (at least
    in the Turkish case),  I think these sort of grassroots/civil society-based gestures
    offer very real promise, as steps to open up these overdue conversations about
    silenced histories.  In that sense, they may be even more productive in the long
    term than the official apologies whose shameful absence they seek to address.

  content: "Laudale sentiments though I would assume a considerable part of educated
    elite opinion in Pakistan now ackowledges what happened in 1971; the only dissonance
    I come across is the fact that quite a few still seem to blame Sheikh Mujib as
    much as the West Pakistani establishmment for failing to reach an accomadation.
    But this might just be my reading since I am not that familiar with the nuances
    of Pakistani opinion on the issue.  The HR Commission does underplay the
    level of violence that happened and is focused more on identifying the weakness
    in military and political administration and personnel that led to the breakdown.
    Some parts of the report are alarming, particularly the castigating of Niazi (an
    incompetent and opressive adminstrator) for not mounting a defence of Dhaka instead
    of surrendering. This would have been a suicidal and immensely destructive course
    of action."

  content: "This is a great initiative and you deserve to be complimented. One
    point i would like to make is that the apology you have crafted implies that the
    killings of large numbers of bengalis were somehow indiscriminate. Actually, this
    is NOT the case. The real mass killings were not totally indiscriminate. The targets
    were Bengali Hindus. This fact is considered inconvenient by some progressives
    in Pakistan (and unknown to most others) because it introduces a religious angle,
    but it must also be faced. There were three different groups getting killed: 1.
    Bengalis active against the army action. By definition, this was targeted killing
    (which does not make it acceptable or even legal). 2. Intellectuals. In the
    mind of the army, this group seems to have been targeted because the Pak army
    really looked upon the Bengali intelligentsia as being left-wing, pro-indian and
    anti-islam. 3. Hindus. This was the group that suffered the MOST casualties
    in absolute terms. This was classic genocide. Not collateral damage, not targeted
    killing of enemy sympathizers or activists, but just indiscriminate killing of
    hindu bengalis because they were considered the enemy just by dint of the fact
    that they were hindus. That is why 10 million bengalis became refugees. Because
    almost every single Hindu ran away. Muslim bengalis did become refugees, but if
    muslim villagers were non-political and cooperated with the army, there was no
    special reason they would be targeted. (in some areas where extensive fighting
    took place, people escaped as they do from any war zone, but such areas were very
    few). It is necessary to have some idea of what the military operation looked
    like. Keep in mind that after some fighting in the initial crackdown (especially
    in Chittagong) there was no organized resistance for a while. By June, the mail
    was being delivered and the trains were running on time. Genocide was NOT official
    policy. Some officers committed no mass killings in their area of control. Others
    killed by the thousands (especially Brigadier Jahanzeb Arbab) . The high command
    was complicit in the sense that they did not stop these atrocities. General Hamid
    (army commander) visited his jawans and in the presence of my father, asked them:
    \"Jawan, kitna hindu mara?\". This was 6 months before the Indian army came in,
    so the question had nothing to do with killing Indians. Hamid and his gang understood
    that Hindu Bengalis were being indiscriminately killed, and they approved.  Oh,
    and to the target groups we can add those locals against whom the collaborators
    had a beef of any kind. Keep in mind that over 100,000 local collaborators were
    recruited into razakar militias (al shams and albadar among them). Most of these
    were biharis but many bengalis also joined. And they got to kill people they didnt
    like, rape women, loot property. And so on...."

    university students were mowed down in their hundreds regardless of religion because
    of the perception that the institution was a hotbet of separatism and Awami league
    activity.  also I thought most Mukti Bahini militants were not Hindus and the
    reprisals that followed areas where they carried out successful operations were
    pretty indiscriminate.  Most eyewitness accounts that I have read like Mascenharas
    don't emphasise that level of disproportionatility amongst the casualties."

  content: "Students were indeed killed without asking about religion in that particular
    massacre. About the killing of Hindus, my knowledge is based on the fact that
    my father was an army officer in East Pakistan from March to November 1971 (he
    actually volunteered to rejoin the commandos from a desk posting in March...motivated
    by the feeling that the army is fighting and he needs to do his part).  Because
    of this family history, I have always been especially interested in that war.
    My father was in Dacca, at headquarters, in a \"helimobile\" commando unit that
    saw action in many parts of the country. He says the massacre figures are exaggerated
    but massacres did happen. And when they did, the army was much more likely to
    kill hindus than muslims.  But a few things first: 1. It would be wrong to
    imagine that some kind of organized insurgency was being fought on a large scale
    prior to october or so. The first action was against awami league workers and
    supporters and was indiscriminate and violent but the killings were in hundreds,
    not thousands (I am not excusing the action, just trying to be accurate).  Most
    of those attacked were defenseless against the army (like the students are Dacca
    university). The exceptions were the soldiers of the East Bengal Regiment and
    East Pakistan Rifles. At a few places, they did indeed put up real resistance
    (as in chittagong, where Colonel Zia ur Rahman was the CO and was the first to
    go on radio and proclaim the birth of BD, if I am not mistaken). 2. In this
    early phase, there were massacres in some places because the army found dead West
    Pakistanis and took indiscriminate revenge. But even at this point, there was
    a preference to find the nearest hindu and kill him or her. 3. The razakars
    were the main local \"eyes and ears\" and they hated hindus more than the pak
    army did. They played a role in steering reprisals and massacres in that direction. 4.
    once \"order\" was established, the army did not face serious resistance. Yet
    a flood refugees headed out to India because Hindus were still being targeted
    by particular officers (not be all of them and not by some kind of official order).
    The actual numbers killed may not have been as large as later claimed, but the
    fear generated in the Hindu community was very real. 5. Things changed late
    in the year when the Mukti Bahini became a more serious force. But even at a very
    late stage, they were not the kind of fighting force that the taliban (for example)
    can put up in Swat or the Tigers had in Sri Lanka  omar"

  content: "And point (3) in omar's comment, about the complicity of parties like
    the Jamaat, is crucial -- because in many ways the killings were the result of
    intra-Bengali conflict as well as a conflict between the two wings of Pakistan.  Omar:
    I am not sure I agree that we can conclude so easily that there was no order from
    \"on high\", especially given persistent reports that Yahya Khan had said things
    like \"kill a million of them and the rest will be eating from our hand\"; Tikka
    Khan's reported comments re: raping as many Bengali women as possible so that
    the next generation would only be half Bengali, etc.  Now, personally I don't
    know if there is incontrovertible evidence that these things were said, but I
    have heard multiple reports of them, they have been cited in books, and even a
    couple of Pakistani relatives of mine have cited them to me."

  content: "About \"orders from on high\" (and this is based entirely on my father's
    reporting, but as I said, he was at headquarters and able to see and hear whatever
    was happening there): He reports that senior officers would say: such and such
    place has rebelled. They have to be \"taught a lesson\". When he asked what that
    means, he was told \"kill the hindus\". He said he would do no such thing (and
    did not) and there were other officers who did not do it, but many were only too
    happy to do the needful.  But what I meant is that no formal orders to kill people
    were issued. This was informally communicated in briefings and knowing the Pak
    army, I think that it was not some kind of thought out policy. It was more automatic.
    It is level at which the average officer thinks.  Also, Tikka Khan is usually
    presented as the villian of the piece. And I would say letting this happen was
    villianous enough, but I do believe that he was NOT the most villainous of the
    lot. He was a ranker and a \"by the book\" soldier compared to the Napoleons of
    the upper classes.  When he was appointed in Rann of Kuch in 1965, he shone because
    he actually visited all the troops and made sure the supplies got there. That
    alone was enough to set him above the average goof who becomes a general in that
    army. He did the same thing in East Pakistan. He got the trains to run on time.
    \ The massacres did not have to be ordered by him, or even desired by him.  Having
    soldiers rape every bengali does not sound like the kind of thing he would say. 
    by the way, you can read my father's detailed interview in Urdu (from BBC Urdu)
    at http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/interactivity/specials/1143_16_december/index.shtml"

  content: "Omar thanks for that, especially interesting to hear your father's interview.
      Yes, I agree tha the Mukti Bahini were not a factor in the early stages
    but I think they became quite important later on; Indian commanders particularly
    noted that their operations would have been difficult without their assistance.
    OF course you can't compare them to the Taliban in Swat etc. but they had little
    organisation or experience - what they did have was a largel sympathetic population.  Re:
    the Hindu angle; that is interesting but I remain a bit sceptical about the actual
    spread of casualty figures as a whole. After all resistance was not exactly confined
    to them but widespread and it would have been impossible for Pakistani officers
    to miss this. I also wonder just how good the West Pakistanis would have been
    in being able to tell the difference between Bengali Muslims and Hindus - arguably
    from the point that Q makes, if all Bengalis were seen as 'half-Hindu' this would
    not have perhaps been somethign they would have been overyl concerned with.  It
    is interesting that most Indian accounts don't mention this aspect; when I would
    have thought they would have to exploit and play up the role of the Pak army as
    a communally inclined forces - of course this doesn't mean it didn't happen, just
    a point of note.  I would agree with you mostly on the issue of orders;
    of course many things didn't need to be overtly mentioned. The knowledge that
    mass rapes were occurring was common currency even in West Pakistan despite the
    censorship on the conflict; as one can see from the notorious jokes that were
    circulating at the time."

  content: 'Conrad: I have read (can''t remember where at this point) that although
    Hindus constituted approximately 17-19% of East Pakistan''s population, they made
    up 50% of those who died or fled.  And while I think it is pretty clear that all
    Bengalis were "half-Hindus" in the racial rhetoric of the times, and thus agree
    they wouldn''t have been "overly concerned" about the distinction (but IMO the
    key word is "overly"; they might well have been concerned ENOUGH to regard religious
    affiliation as some kind of barometer -- and let''s not forget the role of the
    Bengali collaborators: the Jamaat/religious right that was cooperating with the
    army would likely not be indifferent to this distinction), I do not think it would
    have been hard to tell Hindus from Muslims in very many instances, in the urban
    areas/among the bourgeoisie (in more traditional, "liminal" communities, such
    as the Sundarbans memorably evoked by Amitav Ghosh in "The Hungry Tide", the "Hindu"
    and "Muslim" categories become blurred and possibly even meaningless).'

  content: "I feel that the pakistani government does not owe an apology to the Bengalis. The
    questions I have are: 1) Did the government of Pakistan or the army adopt an
    active policy of human rights abuse? 2)Did the government of Pakistan imply
    that the army commit these excesses? 3)Did the government of Pakistan condone
    or encourage such behaviour? I believe the answer to this question is a NO.  Any
    act commited was an act of an individual and not an execution of a military or
    civil policy.Pakistan cannot be held responsible for individuals who acted out
    of their own accord. Coming from a family of 3 generation of officers of Pakistan
    armed forces, I can say with certainity that I have never in my life come across
    an officer lacking the moral scruple that would permit them to commit the acts
    the like of which happened in Bangladesh. What my friends seem to be forgetting
    is that the atrocities were committed on both sides and most of them were retaliatory
    in nature... both parties killing each other in vengence and locked in a perpetual
    cycle of slaughter.  The pakistanis however seem to be suffering till date as
    stranded refugees in Bangladesh.  The legal dimension to this issue is that
    if pakistan apologises then it is legally implying that it was responsible for
    the carnage and had a deliberate hand in it. This could lead Pakistan to face
    international law suites and inquiries and a substantial increase in the already
    tremendous amount of pressure it is facing.  In the end however I would
    add that every life lost, whether hindu, bengali, muslim or from any other classification,
    is a tragedy and the people that were involved in the carnage, whether muslim
    or hindu, bengali/pakistani or indian, they are accountable to their families,
    the victims and their families, their countrymen, to God and finally to their
    own conscious."

  content: About Pakistani army officers and scruples, I think the spread is no different
    from other third world armies of British origin (which means they are probably
    a little better than third world armies of militia origin; this sounds colonialist
    or whatever, but I think its probably true, cannot prove it). But to say "I have
    never in my life come across an officer lacking the moral scruple that would permit
    them to commit the acts the like of which happened in Bangladesh" is an amazing
    statement. So wh0 were the officers and men committing well documented atrocities
    if they were not Pakistanis? you can read my father's account for a few incidents
    (like the officer who tested how many bengalis could be killed with one bullet
    of an M-1 rifle)...

    from a family of 3 generation of officers of Pakistan armed forces,</i>  Pakistani
    Army never considered East Pakistanis as their own they always treated them like
    a burden or disease. We still witness this attitude of Army towards non Punjabi

    agencies according to respective quotas and hopefully democracy flourishes.  I'm
    all for secular government and only vote for national secular party which is right
    now only one i.e PPP but if by fair election we have  religious party, I want
    them to go for full term. Only healthy competetion among civilian leaders give
    Pakistani people the respect they deserve."

  content: "Conrad,  We have a friend in common, Vikash Y.  As far as
    the fighting in E. Pakistan is concerned, have to remember that the E. Pakistan
    Rifles (EPR--akin to your BSF) and E. Bengal Regiment (EBR--regular army) units
    mutinied en masse and killed their W. Pakistani officers and JCOs and their families.
    \ Of 16 wings (battalions) of the East Pakistan Rifles, 14 mutinied and killed
    all their W. Pakistani officers and JCOs (and in many cases their families as
    well).  This explains, in part, the level of violence carried out by the Pakistani
    forces:  partly payback and of course massive escalation.  This combined was probably
    something in the order of 13,000+ EPR and 6,000 EBR (according to Wikipedia).
    \   The combined regular PA troops available there totalled 18,000 (with
    an overstrength tank regiment and of course the regular artillery regiments attached
    to an army division plus the small Pak Air Force contingent in E. Pakistan) and
    some 2,000 W. Pakistani personnel seconded to the EPR.  One should also include
    the several thousand Bengali police (who however ill armed and trained were presumably
    better than completely unarmed and untrained Bengali civilians) who went over
    to the Mukti Bahini.  The two Pakistani infantry divisions and several wings (battalions)
    of Civil Armed Forces sent to E. Pakistan came well after the fighting had started.
    \ The scale of the fighting can be gauged by the fact that, according to the Indian
    official history of the 1971 war, they estimate that Pakistani forces suffered
    5,409 killed and 4,674 wounded between March 26th and Dec 3rd 1971 (I assume that
    these ratios are not a typo in the official history).  One would usually expect
    to see 1:3-4 killed:wounded ratio, perhaps this unusual ratio was because of the
    extremely poor medical facilities available to the PA and that would help account
    for the PAs generally poor troop morale by Dec. 1971.    Dec 3rd is, of
    course, a purely arbitrary date as brigade-strength-plus actions were already
    being fought between the Indians and the Pakistanis by mid-November 1971 (e.g.,
    Battle of Hilli started on  Nov. 23rd; Albert Ekka got the PVC--posthumously--on
    Dec. 3rd).  Quite a few of the 'Mukti Bahini' were actually Indian BSF soldiers
    \ disguised as E. Pakistani insurgents, which might also help account for the
    PA being particularly brutal where Hindus were concerned.  According to the Indian
    official history (p215-216) by the end of June, the Indian Army already had over
    1,600 special commandos in training to carry out missions in E. Pakistan.   Reading
    between the lines, it is clear that the IA decided to use its own men after the
    Mukti Bahini rapidly proved itself unable to neutralize the Pakistan Army.  Major
    Gen Uban, in charge of training these special forces, had 1,600 Indian Army commandos
    and 350 \"Freedom Fighters\" at his disposal (p216 of the official history).  I
    agree with Omar that Tikka Khan was certainly very much a 'by the book' soldier
    and not someone who would order troops to carry out mass atrocities.  This was
    pretty much done by individual units and not as official policy--though I am sure
    that no officers/troops were reprimanded or punished for being too brutal with
    the Bengalis.  Many officers gave their troops free rein to do as they wanted
    after seeing how the Awami League thugs and mutineers murdered W. Pakistanis and
    Biharis--or so they claimed afterwards anyway.  Sarmila Bose's work certainly
    does substantiate the claim of Awami League atrocites/pogroms against Biharis
    (including the much published picture of dead 'Bengalis' killed by the Pakistan
    Army which turned out to be actually a picture of Bihari workers killed by Awami
    Leaguers)--although many have found fault with her analysis.  Anyway, this
    has turned into an extremely long post and its time for me to go!  Regard."

  content: "Feisal,   I disagree with your view of how intense the fighting
    was in the first half of the year. It is true that several EPR units mutinied
    and killed West Pakistani officers and civilians, but the numbers killed were
    small (dozens to low hundreds killed) and these units rarely stood and fought
    once regular army units responded. Instead they ran away and tried to melt away
    into the civilian population, or escaped to India when reprisals became very harsh.
    When the military action started on 25th March, resistance was minimal (by the
    standards of modern wars). I have spoken to several officers who were there and
    they all report the same thing: when the army units marched in with guns blazing,
    they usually found the place abandoned. Random civilians (preferrably hindus)
    \ and supposed separatists were killed in retaliation by some units and not by
    others, but very few armed clashes of serious intensity took place.  Resistance
    was frequently exaggerated in reports to make it look good, but real fighting
    was minimal. For example, in one action Brigadier Atif was still \"bringing up
    Div artillery\" when Major Nadir Pervez walked into town and \"recaptured\" it
    without a shot being fired. Those casualty figures are for the whole war, not
    the first 6 months when casualties were lighter.  Indian commandos probably
    did get used in the manner you describe. But that was not so much because \"india
    was disappointed at the mukti bahini's lack of success\", but because the whole
    purpose was to prepare the ground for conventional war  and prevent Pakistan from
    consolidating and \"burying\" the issue, not to fight Vietnam all over again.
    \ It is not easy to organize an insurgent force and train it when the raw material
    is a million frightened refugees with no martial background. In time, something
    would have been organized, but I think it was never India's plan to have guerrillas
    conquer BD street by street. They had an army and they used it when they were
    good and ready.  positive and negative mythmaking about the events has reached
    the point where truth is hard to get at, but the broad outlines are not that hard
    to find. In my personal opinion, the real issue is not whether half a million
    were massacred or 50,000 or whatever (though that is of considerable historical
    interest), it is the framework in which the Pak army high command was thinking:
    they did not plan to kill millions, but they DID believe in the efficacy of beating
    up and killing people to \"set an example\" and \"clean out the place\" and then
    everyone will behave and take orders like good \"loyal\" subjects of the crown.
    This was one hundred percent colonial thinking and Bengal was the colony. In that
    sense, it remains a crime and the outcome would have been the same (much slower
    without Indian army action, but no different in the end, this kind of direct colonialism
    was becoming impossible for the actual \"crown\", it was beyond the abilities
    of GHQ),  no matter how many of the later Bangladeshi myths turn out to be mythical..."

  content: "Omar,  I believe the original Indian plan was to arrange a 'liberation'
    of a small piece of E. Pakistani territory, install a Bangladeshi govt there and
    get most of the world to recognize it as the 'legitimate' govt.  That is why the
    PA was spread out all over the country, to deny the Indians the opportunity to
    do this.  As far as organizing the insurgents go, the 'raw material' was
    not a million frightened refugees but almost twenty thousand fully trained EPR
    and EBR soldiers--as good or as bad as the rest of the PA, or IA for that matter.
    \ That was supposed to be the hard core of the Mukti Bahini forces.    I
    have seen accounts, some by Indians, describing the almost wholesale induction
    of BSF units into the 'Mukti Bahini;' the Indian Official History (p.101-102)
    openly boasts that BSF units were involved in carrying out actual operations inside
    E. Pakistan before the end of March 1971.  It even goes so far as to identify
    officers and units by name:  Brigs.  P. C. Pandey and M. S. Chatterjee, and Cols.
    Megh Singh and Rampal Singh, COs of the 18 BSF Commando Bn and 103 BSF battalion.
    \ However, the Official History states that these were 'spontaneous' operations
    undertaken by the BSF and not authorized by the central government!   On 9 May
    1971 the Mukti Bahini was transferred to the Indian Army and a Director Mukti
    Bahini Operations (Maj Gen Kalkat) appointed who reported directly to the GoCinC
    Eastern Command (p.183).  The fighting was pretty heavy for a counter insurgency:
    \ in 8 months, the PA suffered 237 officers, 136 JCOs and 3,559 ORs KIA (according
    to Brig. Salik's book; p.118).  IIRC,  Salik differentiated between 'counter insurgency'
    and pitched battles against Indians, such as Hilli.  The Indian Official History
    is openly contemptous of the contributions of the Mukti Bahini and makes it clear
    that their military contribution was relatively inconsequential (as opposed to
    providing local knowledge, guides, etc, to the advancing IA):  By October 1971
    there were over 50,000 Mukti Bahini troops operating in E. Pakistan but, almost
    always, the Official History reports seem to indicate that they suffered heavier
    casualties than the PA forces they attacked.  However, the Official History does
    single out some insurgents, e.g., Kader Siddique, as being particularly effective.  Regards."

  content: "@Neena,@akbar,@omar ali First of all, I am not an 'army jawan', second
    of all I am not what you might say a typical pakistani who denies every pakistani
    fault and believes that all is hunky dory in this country. FYI my grandfather
    was a POW in 1971, he was an non combatant in the Air Force, an accounts offices,
    he was also one of  Quaid-e-Azam's body guard while studying in Islamia college,
    in addition to being a relief worker in kashmir in the late 40's. I doubt that
    such a person or some one of his ilk will commit any egregious act.  Another
    thing that I feel the people over here do not realize is about the meaning of
    the word 'apologize'. In diplomacy its meaning is 'yes it's my fault, I did it
    deliberately and now I am sorry'. For eg, after the americans bombed the chinese
    embassy in Belagrade, they did not apologize but said that they regretted the
    incident, this was to avoid having to pay the chinese a huge amount of compensation
    and to avoid being dragged to an Inernational court.  I have no problem in apologizing
    to the bengalis and all those who suffered at the hands of pakistanis, I APOLOGIZE,
    but the Pakistani Govt cannot for fear of reprisals, such as sanctions, compensations
    and as mentioned earlier, an increase in international pressure offer an official
    apology.  I would never wish suffering on any human. I being an apologist
    for the Pakistani govt, but I believe we should not just divorce reasoning and
    jump to conclusions and make declarations in 'holier than thou' fashion  My
    whole point was that just because of a 'few bad fish' you cannot say that the
    whole pond is dirty. Finally I would like to ask you what would you do if some
    one raped your mother/sister, killed your father/brother? And should your society
    or country at large be held responsible for any act you commit in vengence? Should
    all muslim countries apologize for 9/11 just because OBL was a muslim? Of course
    not unless off coursethey if they helped OBL do it.  And as far as Balochistan
    and Sindh are concerned, please let me know if you have ever visited these places
    or you are just reiterating what arm chair think tanks around the world say. Dont
    forget my friends that our very existence has been christened by the blood of
    these people that you so complacently condemn, so I for one will not let their
    sacrifices go waste or be marred by the few who have shamed not only our country
    but the muslims as well.   *BTW, it was yahya khan who prevented the
    Indians from relocating the library at Quetta Staff college to India, he kept
    a vigil on the library armed with only a handgun.  **Mujeeb ur Rehman was
    one of the staunchest proponent of Pakistan in his youth.  What to say of

    was not a few bad fish. It was a policy which led to the whole disaster. Apolicy
    run by the military controlled govt of Pakistan. So it was not few bad fish, it
    was a policy. No room for denial here. If those who were responsible for this
    policy did not get punished then it happens over and over again. By the way, I
    personally felt as if those wronged in EAST Pakistan, were my mother, sisters
    \  and brothers.  And I cannot feel enough shame  for that. As it was being done
    in the name of saving us all in west Pakistan.  \"And as far as Balochistan

    but the muslims as well.\" All I can say is I have lived in both places and
    am well aware of Pak Army's record there. So your Argument does not hold any water.
    Again if you look at the oath that Army officers take and the things that they
    do once reach the highest rank, is shameful, shameful, and in my view there are
    no twom opinions about it.  \"*BTW, it was yahya khan who prevented the
    Indians from relocating the library at Quetta Staff college to India, he kept
    a vigil on the library armed with only a handgun.\"  Yep, we should convert
    that library into a musuem with artefacts, how valiently Yahya, save Half of the
    country and lost its 76 million muslims.  \"What to say of humans, even
    Azazeel was once an angel!!   What happened to them???? I guess we will
    have to figure out what the went through, now wont we?????\"  Sahil the
    problem in simple words is as follows. The Pak army/military's  training is around
    the myth of saving \"Pakistan's Idealogical and Geoghraphical boundaries.\" So
    instead of thinking about it, interms of a volunteer army, which is getting paid
    by a  very poor nation for doing its job( btw  that is exactly what Yahya was
    supposed to do, without doing any favor to any body's family). The military has
    assumed the mental of a sacred,institution, even though how it has safe guarded
    the Idealogical and Geoghraphical boundries is there for all to see, yet well
    meaning people like you find it bloody civilians fault, who are not letting Military
    do its noble mission. Lokk at Pakistan History closely. All major disasters happened
    on Military's watch and the denial gets even stonger."

    be different from the civilian culture. While we live in a chaotic world, they
    must seem to be disciplined and incorruptible (remember we are talking myths).
    They must live in cantonments as far away from civilians as possible. They must
    have as little interaction with the civilian world as possible. They are different
    people who live and think differently. They must shoot first and ask questions
    later; that's what the dacoits of Sindh used to say about the

    every one involved in this policy failure including the politicians,the bureaucrats,
    media , army and even the Bengal and it would be wrong to just select one section
    for castigation.   However I am not sure about what you said about Balochistan
    and Sindh, infact I have found contemporary journalism woefully inadequate in
    their coverage of these parts of our country. Perhaps someone can refer to some
    informative articles or books.  Now I would like to say something slightly
    irrelevant to the discussion going on. Due to the strategic location of Balochistan
    we will see alot of foreign involvement in the region. So it is imperative for
    the govt to remove any misapprehension and resentment of the people in the region
    before things worsen and for us, I would like to add that we should  scrutinize
    every thing in Balochistan very carefully so that we are able to distinguish between
    legitimate movement of the people and any implanted insurgencies( some say already
    happening). The media can play a tremendous part in this regard in highlighting
    not only govt inadequacies but also in helping to uncover conniving chieftains
    and other people on top of the manipulation chain."

  content: "Greetings Feisal, yes we have a mutual link in Vikash, though I would
    consider him more an extended family member rather than just a friend!  I
    too have some family connections with the Indian army and have a few members currently
    serving and retired, I was able to spend some time in Kashmir with two on active
    duty last year.  From the interactions I have had with army officers, both formal
    and informal and what I have read, has given me a fair if not extensive understanding;
    my experience with the Pak military has been much more limited but reinforces
    what I have learnt from the Indian side. While in terms of personnel command,
    courage under fire and strict military professionalism under wartime conditions
    the forces are praiseworthy; I have to say in terms of strategic vision and political
    acumen as well as understanding, there is a serious deficiency of understanding
    that borders on the stupidly insane. Distorted views of history, unrealistic political
    assumptions about how societies actually function and how international relations
    work and a total lack of understanding of production and financial economics seem
    endemic within the officer corps. I would say that army officers as a consequence
    make very poor policymakers or decision-makers as a rule; I can't
    see much difference between Indian and Pakistan on this, except for the fact that
    in India such officers have never been in the position to make policy, which I
    think has been a positive development.  On the issue of killings, we grew
    up being told of a genocide being committed as a direct result of Operation Searchlight
    upon the Bengalis in East Pakistan by the Pakistani army and irregulars. There
    has obviously been a lot of controversy over this issue and much exchanging of
    claims; I used to accept the extremely high death figures put forward by those
    who claimed that genocidal violence was occurring such as Mascenharas and the
    few other reporters covering the issue at the time. Now I am not too sure since
    some researchers such as Rose and Sisson have placed the figure much lower at
    30,000-40,000. The Pak army didn't provide any figures, rather
    like the Americans in Iraq, the haste with which mass graves were dug indicates
    that they were not interested in counting the dead accurately; the HR commission
    gave the figure of 26,000. Mujib and the Bangladesh govt of course insist on the
    figure of 3 million; which seems quite high. The Blood telegram from the US consulate
    in Dhaka mentions a policy of 'selective genocide'
    and estimates deaths at 1 million. Most median estimates give the range of 200,000-400,000
    with the proviso that not all the deaths would have been due to violent action
    but also disease, malnutrition etc. I think Wikipedia gives the estimate of 200,000
    also. IMO the final figure is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands rather
    than thousands. I think the issue is indeterminate and am willing to be sceptical
    about a policy that undeniably was engaging in a genocide. I would have to be
    since if a genocide had definitely or was definitely occurring; I would be extremely
    reluctant to participate in a conversation that excludes those who were their
    victims. From my knowledge of past genocides, one thing that emerges is that genocide
    denial is deeply entrenched within the 'perpetrator nationality/community'
    and is only resolved either through an imposed victor's justice
    system as at Nuremberg or though a mutually accepted TRC method as in Rwanda.
    Since neither has occurred in the wake of the 71 war, there is little use in a
    discussion where the only sides are the interested parties and those who represent
    the perpetrators. Which is why I set this question aside in the considerations
    that follow and it isn't an unreasonable presumption to make.
    What is known and what I would accept is that indiscriminate mass killings of
    civilians was occurring at whatever level one chooses to peg it at (genocidal
    or some lesser level). Clearly this was unacceptable and it forms the basis for
    some of the specific points discussed. Obviously from the above discussion most
    of the commenters would be operating with the assumption that the scale of violence
    veers very much towards the lowest available estimate of death, which I don't.
    This is not said to open a debate about the issue but merely to record the difference
    since I don't think there is much point in debating this directly. Re:
    the killing of Hindus — my query is that while Hindus were
    no doubt targeted, and perhaps singled out — were they done
    so in a fashion that would mean they would disproportionately make up the casualty
    figures? I haven't seen any evidence to this fact. The participation
    of BSF forces in disguised operations, whether true or not, I don't
    think is directly relevant since these killings long preceded any putative Indian
    action. Unless one makes the claim that the killings were indiscriminate initially
    but became more 'anti-Hindu' once guerrilla
    operations began which is possible but again speculation unless some evidence
    can be so offered. The Awami league was and is hardly a 'Hindu'
    organisation and nor were the demands for autonomy limited to the Hindu population
    in East Pakistan;  given the Muslim majority without deep and entrenched support
    within this community no such movement could have hoped to have lasted. Hence
    my puzzlement at the targeting of Hindus — it may have had
    some communal or visceral rationale but it doesn't seem to
    consistent with any attempt to repress either the Awami league or Bengali separatism. Re
    the mutiny of the Bengali forces — yes though I should add
    that given the disproportionate level of violence I mentioned earlier, I don't
    really see this as a mitigating factor. Initial massacres such as those that took
    place at Dhaka University were coterminous with the mutinies and did not follow
    them. A better argument would be to point out, which is often overlooked, that
    West Pakistani soldiers have for some months before Operation searchlight, been
    effectively confined to barracks in East Pakistan due to repeated attacks by discontented
    groups and militants some of which led to several soldiers being killed. They
    were being socially targeted and boycotted by a hostile local population which
    could not have helped matters. It should however be added that the mutiny was
    in most cases a direct result of the order to disarm the Bengali soldiers; an
    order which could only have been interpreted as an expression of distrust and
    a downgrading of service at the very least, possibly dismissal or worse. As the
    HR commission reports, this as with so many Pak Army operations in this theatre,
    went horribly wrong with only 4,000 of the 17,000 estimated Bengali troops being
    disarmed effectively, the rest mutinying and escaping with their arms. The reaction
    of Bengali soldiers to the order to be disarmed was generally a uniform resistance;
    even when this meant effective suicide as happened at the Jessore barracks where
    despite being outnumbered and outgunned the Bengali troops chose to resist. Re
    the issue of 'orders' and the killings:
    I think here we need to be a bit careful. Are formal orders necessary for a policy
    of mass killings to occur; these tend to be rare in the post-1945 period outside
    the Communist states. No such formal orders or recorded policy existed in the
    second phase of the 1948 war between the Israeli forces and the Arab states, yet
    there was a clear influx of 300,000 Palestinian refugees out of areas that fell
    under Haganah control. Individual orders to 'secure'
    and 'hold' certain towns and villages were
    passed down but there was no blanket order concerning ethnic cleansing. There
    didn't need to be since local unit commanders knew what was
    expected of them. Similarly, with the recent war in Darfur; there were no 'formal
    orders' or recorded policy of ethnic cleansing given to the
    nomadic militias that made up the janjaweed; but central govt knew very well what
    it was doing when it armed and supported one side in an unrestrained fashion against
    the other to create ethnic cleansing and mass killings. Similarly, I don't
    think the absence of any specific order or formal policy —
    necessarily in itself invalidates the fact that such a policy might have been
    occurring on the ground. The level of killing and flow of refugees were certainly
    not stopping or ceasing and if allowed to continue could have reached arguably
    much higher levels. Unit and local commanders, in an environment where they are
    given carte blanche to implement a policy of targeted repression can quickly escalate
    killing levels dramatically. We have seen this in countless campaigns from Vietnam
    onwards. Re the actual 1971 campaign — I haven't
    read the Official Indian history so you have the advantage of me there. There
    is a debate over the effectiveness of the Mukti Bahini with credible accounts
    giving differing views of their capacity. I had the privilege to interview Lt.
    Gen. Aurora before his death and his view on this issue is that the MB consisted
    of several different groups of varying quality but while not a critical factor,
    they did provide substantial assistance to the Indian army once operations had
    commenced and cut short the length of campaigning considerably. I think this is
    a reasonable view on the matter. I don't know where you
    got the idea that the Indian 'original'
    plan was to liberate a small piece of Pakistan and get the rest of the world to
    recognise this as Bangladesh. This sounds unrealistic to me given the US and Chinese
    hostility to Indian actions and the overwhelming reluctance of the UNGA to intervene
    — in the event the GA voted by a massive margin for a ceasefire,
    before the war was finished and for Indian troops to pull back, despite the popular
    sympathy for Bangladesh, violation of international borders on such a large scale
    was not regarded favourably by any except the Soviet bloc which extended their
    support to India. Whatever may have been the case, it was quite clear by the mid-summer
    that a substantial campaign was being planned for; as Indira Gandhi had instructed
    Manekshaw to prepare for the eliminating all Pakistani independent resistance
    in East Pakistan. The IA had the luxury of building up their supplies and stockpiles
    in anticipation of an extended campaign into potentially hostile territory. While
    Dhaka was not the immediate objective; the multi-pronged attack quite clearly
    envisaged an extension of control over the whole territory and not some isolated
    piece of it. The Official history should have made this clear.   On Pak
    strategy, I don't think much can be said. IMO like most militaries
    that control their political structure, the Pak army doesn't
    seem to be acknowledge the fiasco of what happened. Niazi's
    strategy was incredibly naive and had little chance of success since it depended
    on the Indian army doing exactly what he expected it to do, and when it didn't
    and by-passed all the strong points, the whole plan collapsed. Some of the orders
    issued by Niazi are frankly amazing, the order that no unit should retreat unless
    it suffers 75% casualties and then should fall back to their secondary positions
    to regroup the remaining 25 has been described by one military historian as one
    of the most stupid orders given in the history of modern warfare. This kind of
    stuff might have been appropriate on the eastern front of WWII but was wholly
    inappropriate in the conditions of 1971 East Pakistan. By the time that the main
    Indian forces had launched the formal ground campaign, with no air cover, locally
    hostile population, cut off by sea and no help forthcoming; this was simply a
    suicidal venture. After having left his forces strung out so that they were not
    very concentrated anywhere except Dhaka, this was an inevitable collapse. Thankfully
    &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; Niazi's initial
    claims about defending Dhaka to the last turned out to be hot air otherwise there
    would have been a bloodbath that would not have changed the outcome.  This
    whole episode reminds me of the 1962 humiliation that India suffered at the hands
    of China. Weak planning, unrealistic assumptions and a miscalculation politically
    about what the opponents and allies would do led to disaster then for India. Similarly
    factors led to a disaster for Pakistan in 1971. While India seemed to have learnt
    some lessons from 1962, it seems that the Pak army has not really learnt the lessons
    of 1971 at an institutional level. I attribute this to the problems of having
    the military in control of policy-making but that is a separate discussion."

    seem to consistent with any attempt to repress either the Awami league or Bengali
    separatism.\"  The \"puzzlement\" only proceeds if one has your assumptions
    -- but not if one has the army's assumptions, no?  For instance, we now know that
    the Nazis insisted on a conflation of \"Bolshevism\" and \"Jewry\" -- thus, their
    standard response to partisan attacks in occupied Soviet territory was (among
    others) to shoot Jews (I am talking about 1941-42 here).  This seems crazy to
    us, and hardly would have impressed the Soviets, but is not irrational GIVEN the
    assumptions the Nazis were operating on.  Similarly, I think we cannot discuss
    the question of Hindus/East pakistan without focusing on the space occupied by
    \"the Hindu\" and \"the Bengali\" in the discourse of the times -- more accurately,
    the notion that \"the Bengali\" was an intermediate category between \"Hindu\"
    and \"Muslim\", and hence that even Bengali Muslims were \"tainted\" with \"Hinduness\".
    \ Thus in the discourse aspects of Bengali culture -- like saris, Devanagari script
    -- were held up in the rhetoric as evidence of distance from \"Muslimness\" (at
    least vis-a-vis the Persian script-writing West Pakistanis).  The Sisson &amp;
    Rose book (\"War and Secession: Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh\")
    also touches upon these aspects, and some of my relatives have testified to it
    also.  The Bengali Hindu, by this logic, would be the ne plus ultra of \"otherness\",
    and it would \"make sense\" form within that worldview to disproportionately target
    Hindus (and Communists, who were decimated)."

    in the pre-1945 world, and the case of the genocide that has been the most studied/analyzed,
    namely the Nazi extermination of European Jews, the question of orders is a thorny
    one.  As a philosophical and/or ethical matter, it is by no means clear why \"orders\"
    should be the litmus test.  And as a LEGAL matter, the definition of genocide
    in the genocide convention does not turn on orders either (this is not to say
    that orders have no significance; they constitute rather clear proof of intent,
    which is precisely why so few written orders are given in these situations --
    but to suggest that there cannot be proof of intent absent proof of orders is
    to turn the question on its head).  The broader question of labeling something
    a genocide doesn't interest me all that much, although these days everyone feels
    anxious unless they can shoehorn \"their\" cause into the genocide box (witness
    M.I.A. calling the Sri Lankan military action a genocide; one can lament the civilian
    casualties, but I think one does the cause of human rights grave harm by making
    such demonstrably false claims) -- in fact even in the case of Darfur I would
    recommend Gerard Prunier's book \"Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide\" which complicates
    the issue of what is a genocide, and whether this qualifies (while, of course,
    re-affirming the atrocious nature of what is going on there)..."

    need to consider the stereotype -- that I think the likes of Yahya Khan were sympathetic
    to -- that the Bengali Muslim was basically "a peasant", susceptible to being
    misled by wily sorts like Hindus, lefties, etc.  There was definitely a strain
    of thought that if the fount of troublesome ideas was decapitated, the "mass"
    would be docile and passive.  [By way of analogy, some would argue that the post-genocide
    Tutsi government in Rwanda has had a similar attitude toward the Hutus, in this
    instance using the threat of prosecution/indictment for complicity in the 1994
    genocide, combined with selective assassinations, etc., to cow down the whole
    population.  "Africa's World War", again by Prunier, has an excellent discussion
    of the often overlooked post-genocide atrocities that are occurring in Rwanda.]

  content: "Gen Musharraf says,  &ldquo;Nothing can happen to Pakistan
    as long as the armed forces are intact and strong.&rdquo;  This
    is what Gen. Yahya Khan had to say in his first adress to the nation, on March
    29, 1969.  \"The nation has to be pulled back to safety and normal conditions
    have to be restored without delay. The armed forces could not remain idle spectators
    of this state of near anarchy. They have to do their duty and save the country
    from utter disaster. I have, therefore, taken this step.  My sole aim in
    imposing Martial Law is to protect life, liberty and property of the people and
    put the administration back on the rails. My first and foremost task as the Chief
    Martial Law Administrator, therefore, is to bring back sanity and ensure that
    the administration resumes its normal functions to the satisfaction of the people.
    We have had enough of administrative laxity and chaos and I shall see to it that
    this is not repeated in any form or manner. Let every member of the administration
    take a serious note of this warning.  Fellow countrymen, I wish to make
    it absolutely clear to you that I have no ambition other than the creation of
    conditions constructive to the establishment of a constitutional Government. It
    is my firm belief that a sound, clean and honest administration is a prerequisite
    for sane and constructive political life and for the smooth transfer of power
    to the representatives of the people elected freely and impartially on the basis
    of adult franchise. It will be the task of these elected representatives to give
    the country a workable constitution and find solution to all other political,
    economic and social problems that have been agitating the minds of the people.
    I am, however, conscious of the genuine difficulties and pressing needs of various
    sections of our society, including the student community, the labor and our peasants.
    Let me assure you that my administration will make every endeavor to resolve these
    difficulties.  A word about your brethren in the armed forces. You are well
    aware that they have always stood by the nation selflessly and gallantly. They
    have always responded to the call of duty with promptness and devotion. They have
    never regarded any sacrifice as too great to ensure and enhance the glory of Pakistan.
    The armed forces belong to the people; they have no political ambition and will
    not prop up any individual or party. At the same time, I wish to make it equally
    clear that we have every intention of completing the mission that we have embarked
    upon, to the nation's satisfaction.\"  We all know how that mission was
    completed to the nation's satisfaction."

  content: "I posted this comment on another blog; I think it far more pertinent as
    a comment to this post, however belated.  Regarding Bangladesh (then East
    Pakistan) and the anti-Hindu violence committed by both Bengali/East Pakistani
    Muslims and the Pakistani military, in 1972 the highly renowned and well-respected
    human rights organization the International Commission of Jurists did a report
    on what had occurred in then East Pakistan, today Bangladesh . I would exhort
    everyone if they can to read the full report and investigation about the events
    in East Pakistan/Bangladesh in 1971; 40 years after the fact it is still one of
    the best chronicles and investigations.  Here is the link to the report
    put online:http://www.globalwebpost.com/genocide1971/docs/jurists/1_preface.htm  If
    I may quote what is probably the most important conclusion and finding of the
    Commission, it is this:  \"As far as the other three groups are concerned,
    namely members of the Awami League, students and Hindus, only Hindus would seem
    to fall within the definition of' a national, ethnical, racial or religious group'[in
    the legal definition of genocide]. There is overwhelming evidence that Hindus
    were slaughtered and their houses and villages destroyed simply because they were
    Hindus. The oft repeated phrase 'Hindus are enemies of the state' as a justification
    for the killing does not gainsay the intent to commit genocide; rather does it
    confirm the intention. The Nazis regarded the Jews as enemies of the state and
    killed them as such. In our view there is a strong prima facie case that the crime
    of genocide was committed against the group comprising the Hindu population of
    East Bengal.\"  \"The Events in East Pakistan, 1971\", International Commission
    of Jurists June 1972"

  content: "[...] What genocide in Bangladesh? It was India's instrumentalization
    of Bangalis that led to war between a &ldquo;moth-eaten&rdquo;
    Pakistan and a belligerent hegemon, India. The reports of mass rapes are, well,
    Indian propaganda. Those more committed to taking justice as the measure by which
    they make their judgments, all too often fall prey to a sense of balance, where
    both sides commit violence and both need to be condemned in the same breath. Context,
    larger inequities and proportionality be damned. Bangalis were killing Biharis.
    Good old Pakistan went in with good intentions, and in the fog of war a lot of
    violence occurred on *all* sides. The soldiers were basically good people, doing
    their job and following orders. Blame the higher ups — the
    other version of the &ldquo;bad apples&rdquo; theory. End
    of story. [...]"

<p><a href="http://progpak.wordpress.com">Action for a Progressive Pakistan</a>, a group of like-minded folks (I am a proud member) has just published an op-ed in Dhaka's <i>Daily Star</i> concerning the actions of West Pakistan's army against the people of (now) Bangladesh: <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=89678">We Apologize</a>.</p>
<p>On May 13th, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Dipu Moni asked that Pakistan formally announce <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/14-bangladesh-urges-pakistan-apology-for-1971-crimes-zj-04">an apology for 1971</a>. To which Pakistan answered: Let bygones be bygones. I thought the <i>Daily Star</i> had a powerful <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/story-details.php?nid=219">retort</a>. </p>
<p>APP wanted to chime in:</p>
<blockquote><p>The outrageous dismissal of Bangladesh's demand by the Pakistani foreign office -- "let bygones be bygones" -- is a shameful reflection of Pakistan's constructed amnesia over the horrific actions of its army and its political leadership. Not only has there never been any move on the part of the Pakistani state to apologise to Bangladesh, there has not even been any sustained effort by citizens' groups to pressure the government to publicly acknowledge the truth.</p>
<p>As Pakistanis, we find this unconscionable. We find it unconscionable that the Pakistani army raped, killed and pillaged our brothers and sisters in East Pakistan in 1971. We find it unconscionable that the Pakistani state has steadfastly refused to acknowledge these atrocities for the past 38 years, leave alone hold those responsible for them accountable as suggested by its own chief justice in the state commissioned inquiry. We reject the Pakistani state and army's claim that these atrocities were committed in our name.</p></blockquote>
