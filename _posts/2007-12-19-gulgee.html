    am fortunate enough to have met this Great Artist when i was in 5 th grade at
    S.M.S AGA KHAN SCHOOL (KARIMABAD, KARACHI) some 24 years ago. he was the chief
    guest at our art exhibition. indeed a wonderful person and a role model to all
    of us who want to see true and honest people to serve Pakistan in all walks of
    lives and who are tired of corrupt and un human politicians. May ALLAH rest
    his soul in peace. Ameen."

  content: Couple years ago I had visited Gulgee Uncle in his home with my 9 year
    old nephew, Ali Zain and 11 year old son, Zia Ali.  Gulgee Uncle had said to me
    as he personally autographed his book of works of art, "It is so nice to see such
    young children being taught appreciation of art,"  as he personally introduced
    each piece to the children.  Indeed a great loss to the world of art in its truly
    creative form.  Knew my parents, Shaker and Sherali, very well too.  May their
    souls rest in eternal peace, Ameen.

  content: We do not have painting in our house except a scenery bought from a local
    decoration shop. No other art pieces whatsoever. My mother never went to school
    nor has she been initiated in any kind of arts. But she knew about Gulgee. We
    were in mourning this morning, me, my sister and my mother, very shocked and saddened
    by the death of an icon in this manner. It is symptomatic that something is rotten
    in the state of Denmark! But the grief expressed by all and sundry also shows
    that the proportion of this tragedy has not been missed. May it lead to some realisation
    in the nation. May the souls of the deceased rest in peace.

    been in a state of shock and grief when I was informed of Gulgee's murder. While
    I never met this great artist, I have admired and adored his work tremondously.
    Last year I was fortunate to acquire a masterpiece done by him on canvas, which
    was brought over to Canada by a close friend. Since the paint was still wet, Gulgee
    had put a wooden frame around the work to protect it in transit. The frame has
    Gulgee's finger-prints in colour, which I have left as is.  That painting
    will stay with me for ever and remind me of Gulgee's genius. May he rest in peace
    forever."

    their house servant. We add our cry to the many before at this very sad event.
    Gulgee was our next-door neighbor, dear friend and landlord in KDA before he moved
    his family to Clifton. A camel sketch of his hand looks down from a prominent
    wall in our home today. Our lives were and continue to be enriched by knowing
    this family.

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/12/pictureasp.jpeg' width='500' />The list of legends in Pakistani art is a short list: <a href="http://www.sadequainfoundation.com/">Sadequain</a> (1930-1987), A. R. Chughtai (1899â€”1975), Shakir Ali (1916-1975), Laila Shahzada (1926-1994), and Ismail Gulgee (1926-2007). It was great shock, this morning, to read that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7151914.stm">Ismail Gulgee was found murdered in Karachi</a> at his home. </p>
<p>Once, a long time ago, I attended a gallery talk where he discussed Mughal art. I remember only that I left feeling immense admiration for his eloquence and his art. There is scarcely a public building in Lahore or Karachi that doesn't contain a print of his <a href="http://www.getPakistan.com/home/art/IsmailGulgee/IsmailGulgee1.html">abstract</a> series or of his <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/wepk_1.htm">calligraphy</a> series. </p>
<p>Hasnat Abdul Hye has a <a href="http://www.newagebd.com/2006/mar/17/arts.html">short biographical essay</a> on him that gives details of his life and career. More recently is an <a href="http://www.bluechipblog.net/art/artists/art01/art01.php">interview</a> with him by Humayun Gauhar. You can also view his <a href="http://www.bluechipblog.net/art/artists/art01/art01g.php">art</a> in the accompanying photo essay.</p>
<p>A great loss for art and artists in Pakistan.</p>
