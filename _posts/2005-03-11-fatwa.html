  content: "Asalaamualaikum, I am residing in Jeddah Saudi Arabia, completed by
    12 grade looking forward to enrolling in B.Sc agriculture or B.Tech agriculture
    engineering. But I am stuck in a dilemma .i was told by  some religious people
    that advancement in agriculture in terms hybridization, high yielding procedures
    like cloning  or any new technology is  strictly not allowed in Islam . At present
    many Islamic constitution in India and all over the world are regarding as breaking
    the laws of nature by introducing artificial methods of agriculture, If this is
    correct plz specify what exactly is banned in agriculture .plz sir I request u
    to answer my question in brief. My future is relying on your answer. From Amjad Allahhafiz"

<p><img src="/img/madrid.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Spanish cleric Mansur Escudero, Secretary General of the Islamic Commission of Spain, issued a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/03/11/wspan11.xml&sSheet=/news/2005/03/11/ixworld.html">fatwa</a> against UBL today [<i>thanks, tsk</i>]. I can't find the text of the fatwa listed anywhere. Not that my Spanish is all that. Most reports say that it declares UBL outside of Islam based on his killing of innocent civilians on March 11, 2004. About freaking time. It would be nice if Al-Azhar & peeps follow up with some fatwas of their own against UBL. If he can use scripture to justify his insanity, other Muslims should feel free to do the same. Yes, the fatwa is ineffectual but it is not meaningless. </p>
<p>For the Muslims of Spain, I bet it carries a lot of weight. 1492/Immigration/March 11. Spain and Muslims have a history and future to negotiate. It does appear that the bombing has had some <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7101281/site/newsweek/">positive</a> side-effects in that regards. </p>
<p>So yeah. Have a good weekend, gentle readers.</p>
