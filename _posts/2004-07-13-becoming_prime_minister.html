    Yeah definitely. I've always thought that Shaukat Aziz has done a good enough job precisely because he has stayed out of main stream politics. The fact that he is now entering it is a cause of worry, as it means he will now have to make compromises in his work for the sake politics.

    As with Musharraf, my concern is that despite the good intentions, the very dirty political arena in Pakistan will make Aziz adjust the way he does things.

  content: Advocate Sohail Hameed, who filed a writ petition seeking the rejection
    of the nomination papers of prime minister-in-waiting Shaukat Aziz for the elections
    in the Thar constituency, has been arrested by the police, his brother claimed
    on Tuesday. Qamar Hameed, Sohailís brother, told Online that in the
    early hours of Monday night three police mobile cars along with one white private
    car came to Sohail Hameedís residence in PECHS, Sir Syed Road, Block
    No 2, and told the family that they wanted to search the house because some dacoits
    had made an entry. He said after that they took his brother captive and took him
    to an undisclosed location. He said that so far no agency or police had admitted
    that Sohail had been arrested.--http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_14-7-2004_pg1_6

  content: "Sorry Sepoy, firstly apologies that I am invading your comments section
    yet again :) \n(although I promise that I will post it once not 3 times like Nitin)
    \nSecondly Shaukat Aziz was answering a question posed in the Senate. He explained
    his religious leaning. We have not heard any other mulla opening their stinking
    mouth after this rebuttal. After Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's debacle of pandering to
    the mulla who returned the favor by consipiring to send him to the gallows, everyone
    has to prove themselves to be a good honorable muslim to hold public office. So
    if you are asking why Shaukat Aziz did what he did, then religion is an important
    issue. Non-issues do become issues, religion in Pakistan or say abortion or gay
    marriages in the US. Except for the chattering classes in Pakistan (read landowning
    politicians, scheming generals, yellow journalists etc) the common man is least
    bothered about nuances of political route taken by the establishment to install
    Shaukat Aziz. It is always a privilege to listen to him speak as far as I am concerned.
    Do catch last Fridays' article by Ayaz Amir. It explains how people at the helm
    in public office think. (http://www.dawn.com/weekly/ayaz/ayaz.htm)  He starts
    off with Shaukat Aziz but takes a amazing tangent mentioning an article in \"Khabrain\"
    by a retired police official. This article is a chilling reminder of the mess
    that we are entangled in. As for pandering to the right-wing, this phenomenon
    is rampant in the US not that two wrongs make one right. You have your Pat Robertsons,
    Pat Buchanans what to mention extreme right fringes which are so Christian, they
    are also anti-state. Lets wait for the US elections to draw close and then all
    the &Atilde;&not;right-pandering&Atilde;&reg; will be out in the open. Regards
    - Naveed \nPS:  I found an interesting quote by Pat Robertson (I was checking
    the way he spells his name &#61514; someone asked him whether God and Allah are
    the same \"being\".  Enjoy his response. Your comment on it as a historian would
    be educational.\nQUOTE\nPAT ROBERTSON: Under no circumstances is Jehovah, the
    God of the Bible, and Allah, of the Koran, the same. First of all, the God of
    the Bible is a God of love and redemption, who sent His Son into the world to
    die for our sins. Allah tells people to die for him in order to get salvation,
    but there is no understanding of salvation. Allah was the moon god from Mecca.
    That is why Islam has the crescent moon. The flag of Turkey has a crescent moon
    with a star in it. Well, the crescent moon is because Allah was the moon god,
    and that is the deal. But we don't serve a moon god. We serve the God of creation,
    the Creator of everything UNQUOTE \n(source : <a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/700club/askpat/BIO_040203.asp)\"

  content: "Deevaan: You have my permission to post as many comments as you want.
    you will not \"invade\" my comments section. Having said that, thanks for the
    Ayaz Amir link, it is an informative read, indeed. Religion, in my view, needs
    to stay out of public discourse no matter which country. \nAnd if you think I
    have any intention of even commenting on something the likes of Pat Robertson
    would say, you are crazy. I saw him on CBN saying he has found a convert who \"speaks
    Arab\" and has told him that the Islamics train their children to hate Jesus.
    Sigh. Nitin: Just a Sigh. More on the Moon in the Turkish flag soon."

  content: "Sepoy - Thanks for removing the multiple copies of my comment.  I think
    you are quite right in noting how silly non-issues suddenly become quite real
    in electoral politics. We can excuse Shaukat Aziz on that count. The main worry
    is what happens to the house Musharraf built after he goes to that place where
    retired generals go to? (I mean the golf course). Shaukat Aziz may not last a
    day beyond Musharraf."

<p><img src="/img/aziz2.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Elections are a funny thing in Pakistan. We don't have them that often. When we do, they tend to be fixed. When we don't, well..., we have Generals and Field Marshalls for those occassions. The current General in charge, President Musharraf, has "appointed" a Prime Minister. Shaukat Aziz, whom I <a href="/archives/homistan/jamali_juju_breaks.html">introduced here</a>, is due to take office later in the summer. Mind you that Aziz has never held public office or even ran for one. After this decision by the General, Aziz submitted his papers to stand for election for the Provinicial Assembly in NA-59 Attock. He is not from Attock but akin to Hillary Clinton, he can be a carpetbagger.<br />
The opposition is bringing out the greatest hits against him:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is a <a href="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsJul2004/cover1jul2004.htm">Stooge for Bush!</a> says Maulana Fazlur Rahman.
<li>He is <a href="http://www.hipakistan.com/en/detail.php?newsId=en69267&F_catID=&f_type=source">Not A Pakistani!</a> says the Senate.
<li>He is <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.php?id=69340">Not a Muslim!</a> says some other brianiac.
</ul>
<p>Of course, Aziz is none of the above. He is simply an economist who has lived and taught in the US (with Wolfowitz as a student), a civil bureaucrat working with the World Bank and IMF, and a decent enough fellow. However, as a response to all the above, he is out there saying idiotic things designed to showcase him as a hardcore Muslim and a true patriot. He is pandering to the worst possible crowd: the Mullahs. The repeal, or at least, reform of <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.php?id=68123">Hudood Ordinance</a> is the first real test of the post-Jamali Cabinet and, already, Aziz has made all the wrong noises. Predictions are that he will be just another cog in that giant tar-pit of politics in Pakistan. Yes, against all hopes.</p>
