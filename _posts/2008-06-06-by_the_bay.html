  content: "Lucky you. I miss the Bay Area!!   \"But, look forward to more pics!\"  Yes!
    Pics of the piers would be nice. Nice views from Piers 1- 26.  But no pics
    of Apple in SF-- I saw enough of those big glowing Apples everywhere.  Oh,
    and I am sure you will visit the glamorous, wonderful, Barney's Gourmet Hamburgers.
    The one in North Berkeley past Shattuck (rather than the post one is Claremont)
    has a nicer feeling; you can sit outside on the open-air deck and watch the world
    pass by. Which is juicy Guacamole Burger."

    feeling; you can sit outside on the open-air deck and watch the world pass by.
    WITH A juicy Guacamole Burger.\"  Oh, and also, can you have a lemon and
    brown suger Crepe at Crepes Express (or some similar name) and take a pic of it?
    And a cranberry muffin at Brewed Awakening? I miss both of those..."

  content: As you may have discovered by now, the best Indian and Pakistani food is
    not in San Francisco, but in Fremont and San Jose.  But for a real treat, head
    across the Bay to Berkeley and find Vic's Chaat Corner on Allston Way down near
    the freeway.  Best chole bhatura this side of paradise.

<p>I will be in Sanfranchisco next week - attending Apple's annual orgy of technology and hype. But also hanging out with me dear friends. I might live-blog Jobs address but I have a feeling my CM audience will not really care. So, I will IM-blog it instead. It goes without saying that posting will be slight. But, look forward to more pics!</p>
