  content: "I totally agree with you. While one can argue that the picture is tastless
    or offensive to some people, the artist absolutely has the right to freedom of
    expression and shanakht has the right to display it. You can express your unhappiness
    with the image in other ways than rioting and shutting down the festival. \r\n\r\nI
    feel one should not speak ill of the dead, but it is legitimate to criticize or
    satirize their policies.  Making a martyr out of BB is totally ridiculous (recently
    at a Laal concert, she was called the \"mother of the nation\" which makes no
    sense whatsoever)."

  content: "Mushy got some serious triceps!  \r\n\r\nTo be fair to the bloggers, they
    probably all condemn the ghundagardi.  They just skipped past the condemnation
    and went directly to the question of: what are smart ways to conduct ourselves
    in this atmosphere of ghundagardi?  There is no one correct answer to that question.
    \ People who live in that society have to pick their battles carefully.  \r\n\r\nI
    am also amazed by the instant deification of BB.  I just hear Imran Khan going
    off about how the shaheed was his good friend and on a noble mission."

    be too sure: often, people simply go through the motions when they condemn the
    violence, but breeze past it and start talking about underlying (and supposed)
    wrongs.  This is a classic technique, and I am inclined to question its good faith..."

  content: "i was amongst those who commented on a blog that the piece of \"art\"
    was tripe. to be fair, i felt that it was so obvious what the jiyalas did was
    wrong that there seemed to be little point in going on about it. \r\n\r\nmy only
    dismay was that it just was such a half baked effort. i mean, take a look at the
    two pictures you have posted. one is hilarious, the other is trying too hard.
    \r\n\r\ni felt that this was a low point for pakistani art as much as it was for
    our society. because if a picture is going to be provocative, it doesn't have
    to do much. but if it is going to be considered as art, it should hold itself
    to perhaps a higher standard. maybe i don't get it, or am being too judgemental.
    \r\n\r\ni like to think that if i was alive in the 50s-60s, when both the progressives
    and the state hated and bullied Manto, i would have stood up for him because his
    stuff is amazing. would this image age just as well as a Manto short story? somehow
    i doubt it, but if i am proven to be wrong, then i guess it is i who is clueless..."

    merits of this photoshop is rather besides the point. What is not obvious, and
    isn''t besides the point, is a defense of the artist''s right to expression, CAP''s
    right of assembly and a civil society''s right to not have machine-gunned hodlums
    become art critics.'

  content: "Well said: since only a fraction of art ages \"well\", and it is impossible
    to tell which will or will not age well (if someone had said in late-19th century
    America that Longfellow would be forgotten or sneered at in eras to come, and
    the utterly unknown Emily Dickinson or the only slightly better known Walt Whitman
    would be hailed as among the greatest writers in the language, one would have
    been committed to an insane asylum), leaving aside the principle of the matter
    there is a practical problem with saying only \"good\" art should be defended
    vigorously. \r\n\r\nAnd here's the other issue: while one could see this as a
    symptom of the general thuggishness and intolerance that we see around us (see,
    e.g. http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2005/08/shame.html), it is also possible to
    detect something more, namely the continuing cult of the family/dynasty, the shameless
    use of the trope of martyrdom (and even beatification) -- these are all destructive
    of democracy and democratic habits, and in a sense more destructive of them than
    the likes of Musharraf (because it is harder to mobilize against them), and thus
    forums like the Shanaakht forum are all the more to be supported, because they
    are willing to wield the pin to prick various balloons.  The stakes are all the
    higher because this is the PPP we are talking about, and whatever one may say
    it was historically the most populist and potentially the most progressive of
    all the major Pakistani political parties -- to see it reduced to a neo-Shiite
    cult of the family is galling."

  content: "You have drwan attention to my calling a piece of art 'ridiculously meaningless'.
    Thi is not an act of condemnation but of criticism, to which I am entitled. It
    is an expression of an opinion - at par with the artists right to express her
    view which has, since, been interpreted by many to have deeper meaning). Apart
    from saying, in the same post - that \"None of this is meant to condone the aggressiveness
    and violence, threatened and carried out (at least to property) by the PPP jiyaalaas.\"
    I did not dwell on this because it was obvious that this act would be universally
    condemned and not supported. (Wrong again. <i>One</i> email that was forwarded
    to me gloats over the jiyaala action and there must be other warped minds too.)\r\n\r\nMy
    blog posts are not news coverage and analyses of everything. Violence and such
    idiocies I have written about, often, so my POV is known to regular readers. As
    someone who was participating in the festival my post - and subsequent expressions
    off opinions on various FB pages - I chose to write about the flaw of judgement
    \ by the organizers that seemed to me to have been instrumental in endangering
    people and property. I also addressed the fact that I felt, as a strong feminist,
    that the issue was not just BB but women. Of course people manipulate images.
    I do, too, I just do not agree with this usage of it. That, too, is an opinion
    I can hold, I suppose.\r\n\r\nHaving supported freedom of speech and expression
    for years I reiterate that all artist have every right to express themselves in
    every which way - and, in the same post, expressed my objection to the 'censorship
    tack' that the PPP leadership was following. While I believe that a lot of focus
    is being placed on the goondaism that a handful of idiots displayed, an act that
    was condemnable, but momentary and very contained - one that pales in comparisons
    to the numerous far greater acts being committed today - the issue of censorship
    that I pointed out holds a much longer-lasting  danger. Already, the registering
    of FIRs against CAP members has shown what this can lead to. All mistakes are
    not crimes. I would, despite my initial criticism of them, stand totally behind
    them and hope that the rest of their wonderful work will be able to continue and
    next year's festival will be a success!\r\n\r\n(BTW, like many who had to run
    for safety or were helping people collect and remove their goods, I did not become
    aware until much after writing the post that the entire area that contained the
    artwork was all ransacked, otherwise the goondaism issue would have been addressed
    in stronger terms.)"

  content: "\"There is unfortunately, nothing 'liberal'
    about our intelligentsia in South Asia. Apart from some isolated pockets, it has
    ever been thus imo.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a difference between intelligentsia who express
    views on blogs and newspapers, and those who actually try to organize art festivals
    and other cultural events. It doesn't take much to do the former, but to continue
    to promote real-life activity in an atmosphere of violence, incremental changes
    are what one can expect. What Mr. Kidvai seems to be pointing out is that one
    has to go beyond the condemnation (which, may or may not have any lasting effect),
    and make sure that practical problems are addressed. \r\n\r\ni.e. It reminds one
    of the self-censorship that exists in Iran. There has been an explosion of intellectual
    activity in Iran and that has been caused by ensuring that satire, criticism etc
    is expressed within realistic bounds. Clearly, this has more benefit by creating
    a mass movement slowly but surely. Once, a spirit of awareness is created, one
    can indulge in the luxury of \"shock\" and \"awe\".  \r\n\r\nOtherwise, all you've
    got is a martyred movement. As Mr. Kidvai seems to have pointed out in his blog
    the real danger is that governments will use this as an excuse to indulge in greater
    censorship. Thus, it could be self-defeating. \r\n\r\nTread softly...."

  content: Just asking while we are talking about freedom of speech and expression
    is it possible to display picture of Altaf Hussain instead of Benazir Bhutto in
    Zia's lap? After all he is the true beneficiary of Zia's tactics. That art show
    has favored one party and MQM is using every means to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMSVYTgFIPA"
    rel="nofollow">clean her dirty past</a> but they need to learn to do it truthfully
    and gracefully, which is I guess is a lot to ask.

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2009/04/n513812365_1579700_6371905jpg.jpeg" alt="shanakht" title="shanakht" align="left"  /></p>
<p>Shanakht was a festival of arts and performance, organized by <a href="http://www.citizensarchive.org">Citizens Archive of Pakistan</a>[website now 404] which was attacked by the workers of Pakistan People Party because they were offended by one of the images displayed here. You can read a rundown of the event <a href="http://karachi.metblogs.com/2009/04/09/riots-at-shanakht/">here</a> and a <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/entertainment/the-crime-of-expression-hs">sobering editorial at Dawn</a> for background.</p>
<p>I expected the Pakistani blogosphere to universally condemn the hooligans of the reigning party who perpetuated this violence and stand with the artists' right of self-expression. I certainly do. But, the Pakistani blogosphere seems to be universally condemning the unknown artist, instead. It is, they say, "<a href="http://teeth.com.pk/blog/2009/04/09/the-image-that-led-to-the-ransacking-of-the-shanakht-festival">akin to a political blasphemy</a>" or "<a href="http://www.kidvai.com/windmills/2009/04/shanaakht-who.html">ridiculously meaningless</a>" or "<a href="http://www.bitsonline.net/beanz/?p=287">monumentally stupid</a>". Their critiques of the artist and of the festival organizers, directly or indirectly, condone the violence that shut down the festival.</p>
<p>Satire, through crudely photoshopped images and cheekily assembled youtube videos, was the proverbial engine behind the ouster of Pervez Musharraf (head photoshopped over an Abu Gharib image, above). It has not stopped. Almost daily, I get emails and txt messages which poke fun at Zardari. Any yet, Lord help us if anyone puts up a roadblock to the sanctification of the martyr'd Benazir Bhutto. Puhleez. </p>
<p>What happened at the festival was a shameful example of a civil sphere that has neither the language, nor the space, to have dissent without violence. It isn't "talibanization", it is the "ghundafication" of Pakistan. And it continues with tacit support of our so-called liberal intelligentsia. </p>
