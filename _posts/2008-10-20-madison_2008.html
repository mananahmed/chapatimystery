    ayyo, it may well be no use keeping everything under wraps, but it's certainly
    still best to leave some things unsaid, or un-shouted on television!  And
    never mind way forward - sexuality and cricket have always been together. Ask
    anybody who watched matches with Wasim Akram and Viv Richards in them."

<p>The South Asia Madison conference is such a pleasant, communal affair. Every one is in good spirits and any testiness of panel Q&As never spills out into the lobby. It is the biggest gathering of practitioners of the South Asian intellectual trades - though, some disciplines are more gathered than others. (pre-modern folks are few, as usual.) </p>
<p>I confess that my paper was barely there (ok, bad) but my panel, called "Vernacular Histories" was one of the best I have participated on. I further confess that this year's Madison conference was surely in the top 5 evah. Mostly, because there seemed to be a much healthier group of young Turks selling their wares. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/India-After-Gandhi-History-Democracy/dp/0060958588/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224514216&sr=1-1">Ramachandra Guha</a> gave one of the keynotes - speaking on the need to do 'contemporary history' and the urge to write biographies of key "mid-level" figures. Biography, as a genre, is certainly neglected in South Asian historiography (in English, i.e.), and I am sympathetic to his claims. However, that does seem to put Indian language academic/popular works on a different pedestal. Not quite sure why the eighty biographies of Fatima Jinnah in Urdu do not count? </p>
<p>I was also on a roundtable called "Beyond Marginalization: Pakistan as South Asia". It was a useful discussion - in parts. I don't think I was the useful part, though. </p>
<p>The highlight was meeting (finally) the legendary Frank Conlon, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington and <i>karta dharta</i> of H-ASIA. He came to our panel and managed a nice zinger on U of Chicago. </p>

Finally, this came up in discussion and I feel the urge to let you all bask in this glory. Perhaps my favorite clip of all times.<br />
