  content: "Re: \"I am refusing you the equivalence of Taliban with any old &ldquo;Islamic-faith&rdquo;
    based party - because it is a preposterous claim.\"\r\n\r\nTo flesh out what is
    implicit here, not only would the question of \"equivalence\" be problematic,
    but the Muslim League was not a faith-based party at all.  It was, in many ways,
    the MODERNIST side of Muslim Indian politics (the conservative, RELIGIOUS side
    was seen in the pro-Congress camp (Khilafat movement, Ali brothers, and all that
    -- precisely the sort of political religiosity that so disgusted Jinnah in the
    1920s).  Many Indian liberals express bewilderment at the notion that Deoband
    graduate vrai Maulana Abul Kalam Azad ended up on that side of the border, and
    M.A. Jinnah on this one, but that is no coincidence IMO, nor irony/tragedy/what-have-you:
    http://qalandari.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-historical-relationship-between.html).
    \ \r\nAside: speaking of faith-based parties, there have been fewer more \"progressive\"
    parties (whether or not faith-based) in modern South Asia than the Pashtun-centric,
    Islamic Khudai Khidmatgars -- this aside is because I'd love to see people writing
    more about this movement, which is so very relevant given that the relevant region
    is so much in the news today.  If someone could recommend books on this that would
    be great too (the one I am most familiar with is Mukulika Banerjee's The Pathan
    Unarmed, but presumably there are others)..."

  content: "Dear Sepoy,\r\nI don't know what you mean you claim that I say Taliban
    = Talibanization = Islamization = Pakistan (with the Muslim League and the Iranian
    Revolution as historical evidence). I am perfectly aware of the chasm that separates
    the Muslim League of the 1940s from the Iranian Revolution. All I did was to identify
    the demand for Pakistan as politically retrograde but as political (and thus transcending
    ethnicity). I listed a number of political defeats to show that there were examples
    of political catastrophes overtaking the people of Pakistan in all their ethnic
    variety and in their mega-cities - that these catastrophes \"befell\" the cities
    of Pakistan without those cities having \"fallen\" to them in any military sense.
    I am deeply sympathetic to the Muslim League's (and Dalits' and non-brahmans'
    and Tamils') criticisms of Congress brahmanism, and I don't equate Jinnah with
    Zia. It would be absurd to do so, and, undoubtedly, in other parallel historical
    universes Jinnah's demand for Pakistan might have opened on to more livable worlds.
    But Jinnah's demand for a Muslim state was also a necessary moment in the actual
    history that has led to the present form of political Islam (and political Hinduism,
    of course) in South Asia (and world history). But, to repeat, I don't think the
    Muslim League's demand that the \"nationality\" of South Asia's Muslim population
    be recognized was retrogressive per se, though once it began to be territorialized
    as a demand for Pakistan (rather than as a demand for a multinational state) I
    think it changes its character (though it is still not a reactionary anti-modernist
    authoritarianism a la Khomeini-ism in Iran or Talibanism in Af-Pak today). Thus
    I strongly disagree with the CPI's 1942 endorsement of the Pakistan demand.\r\nI
    challenge you to cite anything that I have written here or elsewhere that IN ANY
    WAY implies, \"the 40-odd years of Muslim League political (with leadership coming
    from U.P and Bengal) understanding of Islam as a cohesive force is the same as
    the Taliban's terror-based implementation of &ldquo;Islamic
    law.&rdquo;\" You cannot, because I don't think that or anything like
    that. So, please, don't grossly misrepresent my views. It's like you are not even
    responding to me at all.\r\nWhen you write, \"You don't grant
    any history to Pakistan or Afghanistan. You don't want to hear
    their voices,\" I really don't know what you mean. I read books and newspapers;
    watch tv, film, and webcasts; and listen to audio broadcasts do I not? The one
    time I planned to travel to Pakistan to participate in a leftist conference there
    I had to cancel my plans because our leftist comrades and colleagues were denied
    visas and the conference was canceled. But are you implying that I have some aversion
    to Pakistani voices? What does this mean? Are you making a political point or
    a personal criticism? I really don't get it. \r\nI agree with you when you conclude
    by saying, \"The military response, now that it has come to it, should be smarter,
    focused, counter-insurgency based, and should not disrupt more lives than the
    warlords ever deemed imagine. It should incorporate a political front on which
    the long-standing grievances of the people in NWFP and Baluchistan would be addressed.
    To my non-expert eyes, those are the concerns which should shape Pakistani state's
    response.\" In fact I read as concurring with my published view which you quote
    in your post.  It is a distortion of my meaning to imply that I believe in the
    healing power of napalm. When I say, \"It is clear that the political struggle
    against Islamism in South Asia, as elsewhere, has a military aspect and that any
    marginally desirable political outcome will have been brought about at least in
    part by means of the violence of state action,\" I am not celebrating the fact
    (now, finally, we can avail ourselves of the healing power of napalm!). I'm simply
    saying that there is an ideologically committed force that seeks power by military
    means and that it will have to be stopped by military means. (The Taliban don't
    care if only 7% would vote for them - They will simply impose their righteous
    social order on the backs (and backsides) of the corrupt misbelievers). In fact,
    reading about the brutality of the Pakistani military's current operations in
    Swat, I reluctantly but clearly stated that I did not support them. I don't know
    how to insert the link here, but I did say this on the last thread. I clearly
    acknowledged your concerns regarding the military. Still, I stand by my original
    response to your post to the extent that, politically speaking, the IDPs and all
    the rest of the death and destruction is on the Taliban's head. They, not the
    Zardari government, are fundamentally responsible and we should be clear about
    that. It was they that sought to impose at gunpoint their twisted and barbaric
    politics in the Swat Valley and every one of them who is killed is killed deservedly.
    Again, we should get clear on that. If we are to believe that there are \"good
    Taliban\" then let them prove it by laying down their arms (what provoked them
    to take up arms in the first place? What are their \"grievances\"?)"

  content: "@ Raj, \r\n\r\nI don't think it's fair to say \"Jinnah couldn't exist
    with others.\"  The demand for Pakistan didn't come originally from Jinnah. There
    was a real fear among Indian Muslims that British Raj would be replaced with Hindu
    Raj. We may wish that Indian Muslims had not been so insecure, but it's natural
    that a minority would fear majority rule.  However, as we've discussed on this
    site before the Muslim League not only responded to that fear but also went some
    way to creating it.   \r\n\r\nThat said, Jinnah didn't argue for Partition until
    Congress rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan. So as late as 1946, he didn't want
    to break away from India.  I think we have to realize that the politics of Partition
    were really complicated and not simply blame Jinnah.  Also, I don't think it's
    fair to say that \"Taliban is that extreme that was created by Jinnah\".   Jinnah
    in no way wanted an \"Islamic\" country. He articulated a vision for a homeland
    for Muslims, but it was supposed to include minorities as well (see the August
    11 speech)."

  content: "Spencer, I'm not a historian (I study English Literature) but I know very
    clearly that Jinnah did not want an \"Islamic\" country in the sense of one run
    on shariah. He himself was an incredibly secular person who drank wine and ate
    pork and who married a non-Muslim.  It was the conditions of the time that caused
    him to articulate the demand for Pakistan in terms of a \"Muslim\" homeland.   As
    I understand it, there was a feeling at the time that Indian Muslims would simply
    be ruled by the Hindus as opposed to by the British.  Part of the problem of modern
    Pakistan is this  confusion about what exactly is meant by a homeland for the
    subcontinent's Muslims. Does this homeland necessarily have to be an Islamic state?
    \  I would argue for Jinnah, it didn't have to be.  I believe it was after his
    death that the country's name was changed from \"Dominion of Pakistan\" to \"Islamic
    Republic of Pakistan\".   \r\n\r\nThere could have been alternative futures in
    which Pakistan could have remained a Muslim country without having to be an Islamic
    state.  Anyway, this is not my field, but I don't think I'm mischaracterizing
    what Jinnah wanted."

  content: "Spencer and Raj- Jinnah was so much secular that popular Islamic party
    (Jamat-eIslami) used to call him Kafi-e-Azam. \r\n\r\nAnd here is something from
    credible source\r\n\r\nI<i>n fact, Jinnah fits quite closely the model of the
    classic liberal politician. He disdained populist politics, not least of the sectarian
    religious variety, and argued for constitutionalism, equality under the law and
    the separation of 'church' and state (explicitly
    stating that &ldquo;religion should not enter politics&rdquo;).
    It was this that lead him, in 1920, to resign from the Congress Party which had
    by then fallen under Gandhi's sway. Gandhi sought to mobilise
    mass sentiment, both Hindu and Muslim, through a naked appeal to religious symbolism
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; an appeal Jinnah regarded as highly dangerous. He had no
    ideological commitment to separatism: instead he was focused on what he termed
    the &ldquo;political issue&rdquo; of how to safeguard minorities
    in the new India. While many Congress politicians had no problem with simply taking
    over the old unitary colonial state (in Nehru's case in order
    to pursue socialistic planning policies), Jinnah argued that the whole basis of
    the nation had to be renegotiated in order to safeguard the rights and interests
    of all minorities. Read more <a href=\"http://www.theliberal.co.uk/issue_13/kovar_jinnah.html\"

    what Jinnah's programmatic politics were (what he said he wanted). Your post doesn't
    contradict anything I've written here on this thread or on any other.  My point
    is that Jinnah relied upon entrenched and highly retrograde segments of the ruling
    class that had grown up under the late British Raj, people who were threatened
    not just by the Hindu leadership of the Congress, but by the (at least relatively)
    leftist politics of Congress leaders like Nehru. They were threatened by the Congress
    platform calling for land reform. More to the purpose, they were threatened by
    the strength the Communist Party had by the early 1940s gained a foothold in Mumbai,
    Kanpur, Kolkata, and elsewhere.\r\nJinnah was hopelessly naive as a politician,
    in my opinion. Though he didn't foresee it, it was foreseeable that the Pakistani
    ruling elite would rely on the rhetoric of religion to undermine the rule of law,
    the rights of minorities, and anything like constitutional democracy. Jinnah deserves
    to be criticized on the ground that he should not have gotten into bed with these
    elements for those purposes. After all, he was not simply a writer expressing
    certain views. He was a politician."

    was retrograde is that it both registered and hastened the decline of the anti-imperialist
    and democratic left in South Asia. In other words, Pakistan was created because
    the anti-imperialist movement under the late colonial Raj was defeated in its
    most essential aims, one of which was to overcome the divisions created (or at
    least exacerbated) by the colonizer, another of which was to build up the strength
    of organized labor in Karachi, another of which was the democratization of the
    state and (crucially) the military, and another of which was to break the power
    of the landlords of Punjab and Sindh. I could go on."

<p>We finally come to the nub of the matter. Your response makes it crystal clear that in your reading Taliban = Talibanization = Islamization = Pakistan (with the Muslim League and the Iranian Revolution as historical evidence). Against this absolutely ahistorical reading of present, I have been spewing on this blog for 5 long years. Go read the archives, should you want to guffaw with me. </p>
<p>You don't grant any history to Pakistan or Afghanistan. You don't want to hear their voices. You don't care about any facts because for you, the more "salient" facts are the ones you have constructed. Here is the thing, though, what you marshall as evidence isn't factual, at all. It is your analysis masquerading as facts. The sad reality is that your thinking is (and has been) the dominant trend in the US reaction to 9/11. I am certainly the minority voice.  </p>
<p>The "Taliban", according to your response, are a "broad political movement". They are indeed political - on this we agree, absolutely. But if they are more than warlords - enabled by opium trade or Pakistani army - spewing religious screeds than you will have to show me the proof. What is their political base? If they are a political movement across Afghanistan and Pakistan since the 1990s, then show me when they contested in any of the 6 elections held in Pakistan or Afghanistan? Do they have candidates? Slogans?  Now, I admit that I am refusing you the equivalence of Taliban with any old "Islamic-faith" based party - because it is a preposterous claim. (( To claim that the 40-odd years of Muslim League political (with leadership coming from U.P and Bengal) understanding of Islam as a cohesive force is the same as the Taliban's terror-based implementation of "Islamic law" is flabbergasting.)) But even if I grant you that: the fact remains that those Islamic parties have never garnered more than 7% of the popular vote. Ever. Facts do matters, Spencer. If you wish to convince others of your point of view. If, on the other hand, like the Bush (and now Obama) administration, you merely want to assert your known unknowns than you can do as you please.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I understand the following to be your point of view: There is expansionsist Islamic-fascist power called the Taliban in Afghanistan/Pakistan. This power has to be stopped only by military means. This military might must be U.S. or its surrogate (though, don't trust the surrogate). After the destruction, the Left can spearhead a flowering of democracy in South Asia.

<blockquote><p> It is clear that the political struggle against Islamism in South Asia, as elsewhere, has a military aspect and that any marginally desirable political outcome will have been brought about at least in part by means of the violence of state action. Moreover, as most Leftists would doubtless be loathe to admit, the very prospect of reconstituting Leftist politics in South Asia rides to no small extent on the ability of the U.S. and NATO to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>On this we disagree. And we disagree vehemently. I hate the radical Islamicists as much as you. As a historian and as a Pakistani, I recognize the immense damage that Z. A. Bhutto and Zia ul Haq's Islamization (more specifically Sunnification) policies have caused to the Pakistani nation. As a secular humanist, I appreciate your concern and I will readily join you in working towards spreading a left-based democracy in Pakistan. </p>
<p>But, I don't believe in the healing power of napalm. I have family and friends in Manshera, in Peshawer, in Abbotabad. I have spend time in those streets and alleys. I may be powerless against the drone, but I will speak out against it. I will make my stand - intellectually, ethically and morally - against raw military aggression of either the warlords or the national and international armies. The military response, now that it has come to it, should be smarter, focused, counter-insurgency based, and should not disrupt more lives than the warlords ever deemed imagine. It should incorporate a political front on which the long-standing grievances of the people in NWFP and Baluchistan would be addressed. To my non-expert eyes, those are the concerns which should shape Pakistani state's response. </p>
<p>Let me end here. I would prefer that we continue this conversation at Jimmys. </p>
