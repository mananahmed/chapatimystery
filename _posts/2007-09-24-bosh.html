  content: "Loony booby that he is, Mahmoud got in some zingers yesterday.  His comment
    about Iranian universities not needing to \"vaccinate\" their students was spot
    on - at least as a critique of Lee Bollinger's craven opening tirade.  \r\n\r\nWhy
    exactly am I supposed to find his wish to pay his respects at ground zero so wildly
    inappropriate?  Did I miss the part where he conspired with Saddam to blow up
    the WTC?"

  content: "Imagine how easy would it be to introduce and pimp Iranian president's
    horatio Alger credentials, only if he was willing to do empire's dirty work\r\n\r\nBelow
    is from wikipedia\r\n\r\n\"Personal life and education\r\nAhmadinejad, the son
    of a blacksmith, was born in Garmsar, near Tehran on October 28, 1956. In 1976,
    he took Iran's national university entrance exams (konkoor) to gain admission
    into Iran's top universities. His test score ranked him 132nd among over 400,000
    participants that year,[17] landing him at the Iran University of Science and
    Technology (IUST) as an undergraduate student of civil engineering.\r\n\r\nAfter
    the Iranian Revolution, he entered the Master of Science program for civil engineering
    in 1984. In 1989, he became a member of the Science faculty at the university
    where he had studied.[18] In 1997, he received his Ph.D. in transportation engineering
    and planning from the Science and Technology University. Even after being elected
    President, Ahmadinejad continued living in a simple apartment flat and eating
    meals brought from home, in his office. Both of these traits contributed to his
    widespread support amongst the poorer classes of Iran.[19]\r\n\r\nAhmadinejad
    is married with two sons and one daughter.[20] One of his sons formerly studied
    at the Amirkabir University of Technology.[21]\r\n\r\nIn August 2007, Ahmadinejad
    gave his approval for filmmaker Oliver Stone to make a biopic film on him. [22]\""

    is yet another Muslim engineer. We have too many of them already."

  content: "Here is excerpt from Lee Bollinger's introduction of Pervez Musharraf(a
    bona fide dictator)at time of his Columbia visit\r\n\r\n\"Rarely do we have an
    opportunity such as this to greet a figure of such central and global importance.
    \ It is with great gratitude and excitement that I welcome President Musharraf
    and his wife, Sehbah Musharraf, to Columbia University.  ...\r\n\r\nWe at Columbia
    are eager to listen.  As a community of scholars and as students and faculty who
    come from everywhere in the world, we take a great scholarly and personal interest
    in what the President has to say.  The development in Pakistan over the past several
    years, from its economic growth to its fight against extremism and terrorism,
    are vital issues for all of us.  Mr. President, as you share your thoughts and
    insights you will give our students, the leaders of tomorrow, first-hand knowledge
    of the world their generation will inherit.\""
