  content: "<i> This Ethan Bronner controversy is silly. NYT is not &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
    when it comes to Israel/Palestine issues, Middle East or the global South in general.
    Let the man's son do whatever he wants to do. What difference
    does it make to us? </i>   Yeah but is it ever going to change if we
    just keep on accepting it and besides plenty of people do think it is fairly objective.
    Nobody is saying the guy's son can't do what he wants but lets not pretend that
    doesn't impact on his reporting and couldn't the NYT at least find someone who
    pretends to be more impartial than these pseudo-liberal crypto-Zionists?"

<p>Most of my usual conversation (passing/commenting on links) has moved to twitter, so doing a sunday link post seems almost, well, retro. </p>
<p>Still, things I do for you, gentle readers, will always be en vogue. Because that is how awesome you are. Each and every single one of you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Drake Bennett's <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/02/07/changing_history?mode=PF">Changing History</a>, <em>Boston Globe</em>, Feb 7 2009, puts forth what our new approaches are going to look like: enviormental, pacific, archeoscience, and neurohistory. Without taking away the merit of Mr. Bennett's piece, it is clear he is no historian. Still, worth your thoughts.
<li>A couple of posts from the NYRB blog (really, you should just read it regularly): Malise Ruthven on <a href="http://blogs.nybooks.com/post/367367110/talibans-a-la-francaise">French Talibans</a> and Max Rodenbeck on <a href="http://blogs.nybooks.com/post/359669973/jaipur">Jaipur Literary Festival</a>. Our friend William Dalrymple is a man of many victories.
<li>A history of <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/arts/movies/article102276.ece">Tamil cinema</a> from <em>The Hindu</em>.
<li>Staying in Hindoostan - the Big Picture showed some amazing photos of <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/02/colorful_india.html">Republic Day 2010</a>. I think the pink motorcycle crew deserve a beer.
<li>This Ethan Bronner <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2010/02/the-times-now-owes-it-to-its-readers-to-assign-an-arab-american-reporter-to-jerusalem.html">controversy</a> is silly. NYT is not "objective" when it comes to  Israel/Palestine issues, Middle East or the global South in general. Let the man's son do whatever he wants to do. What difference does it make to us?
<li>David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson's site is awesome. Start <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=6759">here</a>.
<li>Zunguzungu, <a href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/things-you-can-do-with-an-umbrella/">Things You Can Do With An Umbrella</a>. Ella, ella, ella, eh.
<li>I have been thinking what the Pakistani equivalent of the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/paying-zero-public-services">Gandhi Rupee</a> would be.
<li>"...I suddenly realized that I knew the luminance of the moon â€” 250 c/ft2. Using the Exposure Formula, I placed this luminance on Zone VII; 60 c/ft2 therefore fell on Zone V, and the exposure with the filter factor o 3x was about 1 second at f/32 with ASA 64 film." <a href="http://www.anseladams.com/content/ansel_info/ansel_ancedotes.html">Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico</a>.
</ul>
