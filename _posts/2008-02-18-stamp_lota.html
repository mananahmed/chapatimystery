  content: "With all due respect to Aitzaz Ahsan, Turkey's got a more than adequate
    homegrown supply of asshole generals.  They hardly need to be contemplating imports.  Still,
    here's hoping there's a plane to somewhere.  If not a short trip to a well-appointed
    cell."

<p>A live-blog on the election results from Pakistan. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php?option=com_altcaster&task=viewaltcast&altcast_code=6c663a1923&height=550&width=470" scrolling="no" height="550px" width="470px" frameBorder ="0" ></iframe></p>
<p><b>update, the morning:</b> The morning - here - shows that PPP is within sight of a 2/3rd majority in the NA. The ANP will form a govt. in NWFP. In Baluchistan, PML-Q has most votes but between PPP and Independents and BNP there are enough votes to form a govt. </p>
<p>One: Musharraf got voted out everywhere. PML-Q, as I wrote earlier, was the only party that ran a campaign on their "record" and its major figures, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, Sheikh Rashid, Wasi Zafar etc., were main characters in the Musharraf soap-operatic democracy. They are all out on the national scene. I think that the recent economic pains - lack of flour in the market, rising costs of water and electricity - had a lot to do with PLM-Q's defeat.</p>
<p>Two: PPP is the only national party in the country.</p>
<p>Three: GO ANP in NWFP!! Our State Side Analysts will have to come up with a new storyline.</p>
