    rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> be what dredged up those Skylab memories?   The
    NYTimes \"Ethicist\" gives 'shoot from the hip' a bad name, every week: I only
    read him when someone insists that it's a <i>real</i> trainwreck. A little basic
    knowledge of history jobs would suggest that the young-earther is likely to end
    up <i>teaching</i> early history at some point, and teaching potential is almost
    always something that graduate recommendations want addressed."

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg"/>"The worst uncontrolled reentry in history occurred in July 1979, when Skylab, America's abandoned, 78-ton space station &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; which had long since run out of maneuvering fuel &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; came down earlier than planned, raining debris across the Australian outback."</p>
<p>We would be playing out in Doha's deserty fields and my mother, standing in the doorway, would keep an eye on the sky - hoping to pull her children in, if she saw Skylab. Our neighbor, Auntie something-or-the-other, was convinced it was her house that will be crushed by Skylab. They spent hours talking about it.</p>
<p>I convinced my mother that if Auntie something-or-the-other is right, we will be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/11/newsid_3867000/3867739.stm">spared</a>.</p>
<p>I have no idea why I suddenly remembered Skylab.</p>
<p>Pleasantries aside. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Military-Inc-Inside-Pakistans-Economy/dp/0745325459/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202063672&sr=8-1">Ayesha Siddiqa</a> visited Chicago this weekend. She spoke at an event and then participated on a panel with two other participants. I will put up word and video of both as it becomes available. It was a delight hosting her and I look forward to her next book. </p>
<ul>
<li>In the WSJ, Rebecca Dana's <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/SB120189888101136151.html?mod=hpp_us_pageone">Reinventing 24</a>, tells us about the "Calcutta Cricket Club" and about Muslim actors denying participating in the 24verse. Crazy. I am willing to sign up.
<li>Eric Weiner keeps the Orientalist traditions <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/magazine/03lives-t.html?ex=1359694800&amp;en=cda81926e5306ec6&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">alive and well</a>. Between him and Somini Sengupta, NYT is just a delight to read.
<li>A couple of days ago Selig Harrison made all kinds of funny in the NYT - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/opinion/01harrison.html?ex=1359608400&amp;en=193a144dd610b790&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Drawn and Quartered</a>. It is just terrible history and terrible analysis.
<li>In the LRB, Eric Hobsbawn <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/hobs01_.html">remembers the Weimar</a>. Recently, I acquired <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interesting-Times-Twentieth-Century-Life-Lives/dp/1565849655/ref=pd_bbs_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202064759&sr=8-6">Interesting Times</a> and am reading it piecemeal. I just have one question: Why is it that our generation of historians cannot write that pretty?
<li>In the WaPo, Nicholas Schmidle <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/30/AR2008013003012_pf.html">remembers Pakistan</a>. Pakistan's history is indeed suffering. As are, the historians.
<li>Speaking of suffering historian, this question is just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/magazine/03wwln-ethicist-t.html?ex=1359694800&en=22eb5c1f6189edbf&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">lame</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix081prSiNc">Professional sports</a> is very <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/opinion/professional_sports_is_very">interesting</a>.
</ul>
<p>Remember, gentle readers, that on Feb 7th, Lapata will have her show at Bollyhood. I hereby request I-Reports from everyone who belongs to the CM world and goes there. All the I-Reports will be published right here, on CM. Your chance for greatness lies within your grasp. </p>
