  content: "<b>submitted via email</b>\nWe ought to take Wolfe's observations to heart
    if we're to understand why the bad guys handed us our asses on Tuesday. Big
    trouble lies&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;in the fact
    our side controls the legitimate media, which a hundred-million or so&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;of
    our fellows have abandoned. The reasons for this are numerous, but most relevant
    to our concerns is the fact that for very long we have treated a plurality as
    though it is an ignorable minority. Now they have FoxNews, Rush and the Weekly
    Standard--they can read the arbitrons and circulation figures as well as anyone.
    They know Toby Keith outsells and outdraws Madonna, but is seen nationally only
    on Ford truck commercials. They attend politically tinged evangelical events that
    draw 80,000,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;but the local
    news&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;ignores the event to
    report on a NARAL protest at the local university.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;They
    rightly ask why their world is ignored. We, on the other hand, live in a college-town
    echo-chambers and have&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;deluded
    ourselves into thinking we're a clear majority. I do not agree with Jane Smiley--the
    red states are not \"unteachable.\" It is in fact the notion that they ought to
    be taught that is the problem. Wolfe is right when he says, \"[S]upport for Bush
    is about not wanting to be led by East-coast pretensions. It is about not wanting
    to be led by people who are forever trying to force their twisted sense of morality
    onto us, which is a non-morality. That is constantly done, and there is real resentment.\" I
    like that Wolfe mentions Zola. Perhaps we need to take a look at our own small-l
    liberal roots, decide what's negotiable, and protect our core values to the death.
    I know the red states. America is a tolerant, if not approbational, place. Most
    Americans can agree on a baseline of tolerance, civility and common sense. Unfortunately,
    as a people--this includes me and your greencard toting behind, Sepoy--we are
    proud, easily offended and, regardless of our philosophical groundings, many of
    us hold to untenable beliefs that render the term cognitive dissonance useless
    for want of coverage. It would be fine if we could all admit that, find a lowest
    common denominator and get on with it. For all our talk of the Enlightenment
    and our being heirs to it, we are weak. For many, our educations terminated with
    a sort of nihilist worldview borne of Humanities curricula deconstructionism.
    We know all the right questions and are convinced there are no answers. That's
    the rub, I think. True as I believe our stance is, the fact remains that our adversaries
    have a narrative, they recite it, and assure our countrymen of its righteousness
    and their place in it. They frame issues in terms of must instead of ought. Look
    back--there was a time when our guys held the moral high-ground--FDR and JFK appealed
    to the best of us. They offered alternative worldviews based on rightness and
    wrongness, though at heart both clearly believed and practiced realpolitik. They
    allowed clear, shining optimistic choices, because they understood that people
    want a script by which they may live life. We must decide whether following
    our purported stances to their logical conclusions, with which Rove and ilk&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;skewer
    us via reducto ad absurdum, is worth it. For instance, should we, the&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;clear
    victors in the abortion/life debate,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;continue
    to defend late term abortions for the sake of not allowing the pro-lifers a single
    victory? (Read Cynthia Gorney's Harper's article this month). Maybe--but if so,
    we may also deserve our minority status. There is a price to pay for ideological
    purity, and we may \nhave just paid it. Instead of using John Edwards' moving
    and eloquent \"Two Americas\" observation to its fullest potential, we used it
    as our margin, and pulled back. After all, if reality itself is an agreed-upon
    fiction, why can't we choose to do things another way? The beautiful thing about
    the Enlightenment, and our being heirs to it, is that we have freed ourselves
    from the old narratives and may&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;choose
    how we order our affairs. It seems that we've confused freedom from narrative
    borne of our recognizing it as such with a natural absence of narrative altogether.
    It's quite the opposite, and by withdrawing from political storytelling,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;we've
    created an ideological vacuum. It's been filled, and we are the worse for it.
    Shame that the world may end for want of a story. If we're to be legitimate
    again, we must get our shit together and offer an alternative view that is articulable
    and defendable, rather than a patchwork of a hundred unrelated grievances. Wolfe
    is right about red state rebellion against East Coast pretense; thankfully, he's
    wrong if he thinks that means America is&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;big-c
    Conservative. The red states went red because&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;because
    we are scattershot in our aims, slapdash in our presentation, and incoherent in
    our reasoning. We have no story for them, and until we give them one, they'll
    remain against their own interests where they're welcomed and invited. To do otherwise
    would be impolite. To quote Bush's favorite political philosopher, and a favorite
    of mine as well, \"Remove the plank from thine own eye,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;before
    you remove a speck from thy neighbors.\""

  content: "I agree with manan that Morality is something of a red herring. Not that
    people don't care about morality (or their conception of morality), but rather
    that morality is not an issue where movement can be achieved in the next few years.
    The many issues that come under the umbrella of morality - abortion, gay marriage,
    good, down-home values - are a fundamental division in our country. This is not
    the place to make a political argument - people are no more open to political
    questioning of their morality than they are open to political questioning of their
    religious beliefs. Class warfare is also a piece of the problem - and a large
    one at that. There is another element, however, that I didn't notice in Manan's
    post, but that I feel is one of the most fundamental problems facing democrats
    today. It is a lack, if you will, of Cajones. We don't have the balls to stand
    up and present ourselves as different. We don't choose a candidate who will present
    the democratic platform as distinct from the republican, but one who will seem
    as close to one of the republicans as possible, while still being different.  I'm
    not saying that Kerry is a conservative dem (ha), I'm saying that the entire campaign
    was engineered to make him appear to be as little different from bush on the issues
    as possible. Sure, towards the end he started to take stands -but these stands
    came because he was forced to them by the lack of yeast in his numbers. If our
    political strategy continues to be <i>how can we make sure we don't piss off anyone
    at all</i> we will continue to get fantastically whomped in every election. Here's
    what I think can reach across these red-blue borders in our country: courage and
    conviction. I think people in every state - perhaps particularly those who are
    often caricatured as the red voters - respect courage. Respect a willingness to
    stand up and say this is wrong. this is right. And this is what I believe. Most
    democratic candidates do this when they are forced to by the political winds.
    Republicans do it at the drop of a hat. Now of course this is an over-generalization,
    but just the same. The way to reach across is to show the voters candidates who
    believe in their stances as much as they say they do. Not candidates who pay lip-service
    to a liberal position, but candidates who believe in them. If we are going to
    ever hope to change people's minds on these ingrained issues, first the candidates
    have to convince people that THEY believe in them."

<p><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2004/" border=0><img src="/img/purpleamerica.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6></a><i>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about "Where do we go from here?" that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. (Yes) There are forty million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question, "Why are there forty million poor people in America?" And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a question about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. (Yes) And I'm simply saying that more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's marketplace. (Yes) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. (All right) It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, "Who owns the oil?" (Yes) You begin to ask the question, "Who owns the iron ore?" (Yes) You begin to ask the question, "Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that's two-thirds water?" (All right) These are words that must be said. (All right)</i>. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his "Where do we go from here?" <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/Where_do_we_go_from_here.html">speech</a> in Atlanta, 1967.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I gave money to a political campaign (no, I never checked the box to donate a $1 to the Presidential Campaign on the tax return). For the first time in my life, I volunteered. For the first time in my life, I publicly sought support for my candidate. I am not unique. Hundreds of thousands of first-time Democrats worked for Dean or Kerry campaigns. And it was not <i>enough</i>. </p>
<p>Where do we go from here? There is a lot of chatter about what the Democrat now has to do? Not stop, is what. Some analysis is needed, of course. To understand what has transpired. Some stabs are being made, here and there. In Slate, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2109218/">Jane Smiley</a> makes an argument that it is cultivated and fostered ignorance that makes the red states red. Which is exactly the sort of thing that Tom Wolfe <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1340473,00.html">says pisses off</a> the red states:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">I think support for Bush is about not wanting to be led by East-coast pretensions. It is about not wanting to be led by people who are forever trying to force their twisted sense of morality onto us, which is a non-morality. That is constantly done, and there is real resentment. Support for Bush is about resentment in the so-called 'red states'<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Morality, eh? I am loathe to acknowledge that the Golem that suddenly confronts us is Morality. Yes, I know that the "polls" all show that "moral values" was the # 1 concern. But that is just a keyword for we don't like fags getting married. Not a moral issue - but a cultural one. If sanctity of marriage really keeps 55 million Americans up all night than I suggest they re-visit the whole "divorce" thing or the "adultery" thing or the "quickie marriage" thing. Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Real World, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? are all north-eastern hits? Spring Break happens on Martha's Vineyard? Mardi Gras at the corner of Haight and Ashbury? </p>
<p>I don't know much but I would like to wager that morality alone is a red herring (pardon the pun). Class is still the elephant no one wants to talk about in America. The down-home values, the country-feel is all about class, not about morality. Heck, ever read Faulkner? Class seems a better bet to me. However, it is not <i>one</i> thing. The anti-intellectual strain that Jane Smiley calls ignorance is also misleading. There is no "lack of intelligence" in the Red states. But there is a particular abhorrance of, what I would call, "putting on airs" or anti-elitism which plays a role. The verbal stumblings of the Chosen One (ne&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&nbsp; Our Fearless Leader) are not the signs of stupidity as read by the latt&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&nbsp; sipping, NewYorker reading crowd but signs of normalcy as read by your average trailer trash. Bubba speaks like that. Bubba knows he ain't got book-smarts, so Fuck You. But, remember, Bill Clinton was a Rhodes scholar. Except his public persona was one of homily-spitting, fried chicken eating, gospel singing homeboy. And get this, he wasn't pretending either.</p>
<p>Juan Cole <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/2004_11_01_juancole_archive.html#109958311857266842">argues</a> that America will only vote for a Southern Democrat. To beat them, we need one of them. Well, John Edwards is one of them and he got squat from them. And he lost the primaries. So, it is more than just finding a Southern Democrat. We need a framer. Or a re-framer. But, I am not even remotely closed to discussing 2008. I would like, first, to understand why I am now a three time minority in this country (south asian, muslim, democrat). </p>
<p>I may be all kinds of off here but, I'd rather put it out there and think it through. There is lots of read and talk about and I will do it in the coming months. Hopefully, this conversation can be shared by <a href="http://www.1984produkts.com/donkeyhottie/wordpress/archives/2004/11/06/mourning_in_america/#more-1401">moacir</a>, marlowe, mark and the rest of my gentle readers. Normal broadcast can now resume. Have a good, safe weekend.</p>
<p><b>update</b> (Nov. 8): <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_11/005117.php">Kevin Drum</a> actually read the exit polls from 2000 and 2004 and concludes that the "morality" issue is, indeed, a red-herring.</p>
