    are for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;spot-fixing&acirc;&euro;\x9D, and limited to bowling
    deliberate no-balls; the News of the World story does not include any claim by
    Mazhar Majeed that these players were deliberately dropping catches, or throwing
    the match. Both are equally wrong, but both do not have the same impact on the
    outcome of a match (to the extent a youngster like Aamer is indeed involved, one
    could also see how a kid might be seduced into thinking this sort of spot-fixing
    is no big deal; I would be less forgiving of Asif, who is more experienced but
    who has already had quite a history of scandal, including one involving a banned
    substance)."

  content: "This is not really surprising. Match fixing allegations have been around
    for years and unlike Qalandar, I believe a lot of them are true and so is this
    one (which is, of course, a sting operation). Of course its happened in other
    countries and probably still does (remember the excellent movie about the black
    sox scandal: what was it called, \"eight men out\"?) but psychologically, cricket
    is a bigger deal for Pakistan than those scandals.... its also the fact that cricket
    was already at a record low point in Pakistan and these youngsters were just starting
    to look like there is hope for the future. Mohammed Amir in particular was such
    a sensation just a couple of days ago and now this. To throw it all away like
    this and to be humiliated on live TV.....it still hurts. Very sad indeed. And
    the inevitable defensive anger will not be pleasant either (look for the inevitable
    lashing out against English-Zionist-Hindu conspirators from the paknationalist
    crowd, who will also demand death sentences for the perpetrators). This was, after
    all, a sting operation.\r\nBut I also agree with those who think that in spite
    of all this is not the end of the world, the country will muddle through. My optimism
    (or optimistic pessimism) has recovered after a nasty 24 hours. In any case its
    not like one can even wish for this elite and this state to fall to a well deserved
    bloody revolution. The only revolution on the cards is an Islamist one and talk
    of a cure worse than the disease.....I hope that 5000 years of \"muddling through\"
    will hold up against this and other more concrete disasters. Its painful to be
    optimistic today, but its a 180 million people (over one billion if you count
    the inevitable fallout in India); the alternative is too horrendous to contemplate..."

  content: 'Omar: I never said I didn''t believe that a lot of the match fixing allegations
    were or were not true, simply that I was inclined to wait until we had more facts,
    evidence, etc.  [I might add that what is involved in these particular allegations
    is SPOT fixing and not MATCH fixing.]  Especially, in Pakistan and among Pakistani
    cricket fans, it is important to recognize that match-fixing functions as both
    wound and balm, enabling any number of cricketing defeats (especially to India)
    to be explained away (the victories, interestingly enough, are never accounted
    for, and this is so even after the whole Sharjah enterprise fell into grave disrepute)
    -- perhaps one can''t be surprised at that given the cynicism surrounding the
    issue, but at least since Asif Iqbal''s captaincy was ruined by a series loss
    in India in 1981(?) (his status as an adult migrant to Pakistan from India, and
    hence the specter of divided loyalties, was an uncomfortable subtext to the whole
    affair), we should be careful in deploying the sword of corruption.  I''m not
    trying to be an ostrich, but there is another side to it.'

    Mazhar Majeed is now free.  I mean, clearly not everything is lily-white here,
    but if there is insufficient evidence to press charges against a man caught on
    camera boasting about fixing matches (see http://www.cricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/content/current/story/475246.html)
    then it seems unlikely that there will be enough evidence against the likes of
    asif and aamer.  In such circumstances, I cannot subscribe to the mentality that
    has loudly been chorusing \"ban them all, for life\", irrespective of proof. [Gavaskar
    ratcheted up the rhetoric on NDTV yesterday by saying all cricketers found guilty
    of any kind of fixing should have their records expunged in addition to any bans;
    then kinda looked silly by explaining how this would work at the level of scoreboards.]"

  content: "Qalandar, you may be misreading Mazhar's release. Last I saw, he was going
    to be charged and so are other people. But the wheels of justice grind slowly...\r\nBy
    strictly legal logic, nobody is guilty until proven in a court of law, but we
    are not only concerned with proof in a court of law.  The video evidence in this
    case is very damning. That does not necessarily mean it will lead to convictions.
    \ There will be NO satisfactory explanation for the no-balls, but even so, no
    crime is committed unless bets were placed and bettors suffered loss as a result
    of the fixing.  So dont confuse the legal status with the public humiliation and
    the damage to cricket and to careers that has occurred and will continue....\r\nbtw,
    the inevitable crowing and grandstanding in the Indian media and the inevitable
    defensive anger and bitterness in Pakistan also count as fallout. And I dont see
    how Amir and Asif will survive this mess... Even without a conviction in a court
    of law, the consequences are not looking good."

    I doubt it; or, it will be short-lived (not to say that such short-sightedness
    is beyond crowers): NDTV and CNN-IBN reported on the Indian bookie connection,
    and anyone who thinks spot-fixing ISN'T a scandal-in-the-making in the IPL is
    probably living in fantasy land. [Vague allegations to that effect have already
    been made about the ICL and IPL.]"

  content: "PS -- to be fair, at least the former players (like Kumble) have been
    circumspect about singling out one country (as well they might: Hansie Cronje,
    Kapil Dev, Azharuddin, Prabhakar, and Salim Malik do not, after all, share any
    passport).  That being said, I have little doubt that had Pakistan made an example
    out of players of the stature of Kapil, Azhar etc. years ago, they would likely
    be in a better position today (even the Mazhar Majeed video does feature him saying
    that match-fixing is a lot more difficult than it used to be).\r\n\r\nPPS -- this
    whole affair reminded me of the CBI transcripts of that famous bookie from years
    ago (Ajay Sharma?  don't recall his name), wherein the bookie said that the best
    fixed matches were the ones were neither player on either team was aware of anything
    -- he cited Tendulkar's first match as captain as an example, where he claimed
    that it was groundstaff that had been bribed to prepare a sub-standard pitch for
    the India/Australia test in Delhi.  The relevant betters in that instance apparently
    didn't care who won, as money was riding on how many days the test match would
    be completed in; even in the best of circumstances the Kotla pitch crumbles as
    the game wears on, so unless one were in the know, nothing about the match scorecard
    would signal anything was amiss:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63721.html"

  content: "S: that is true in general for the major stars, but as far as a Muhammad
    Aamer is concerned, that is more a question of what he will make than what he
    has made.  And then, given the horrible way in which the cricket board discards
    bowlers once they are injured or once a new bowler shows up from the country's
    fast bowling assembly line, no-one can feel very secure (when even Waqar Younis
    was treated shabbily, 'nuff said.  Who remembers where Aamir Nazir, Muhammad Akram,
    Shabbir Ahmed, etc. etc. are today?).  I am reminded yet again of the CBI bookie
    transcripts references above, where the gentleman being interrogated quoted Azharuddin
    telling him (referring to Sachin Tendulkar in choice language) that the !@#$#@
    earns crores through ads, and won't let me make a little bit of money [i.e. by
    fixing matches!]  Amazing sense of entitlement, really, but I am sure that must
    have been part of the Salim malik mindset too (i.e. envious at the glamour-driven
    endorsement bonanza of a guy like Wasim Akram).\r\n\r\nAside: of all the match-fixing
    scandals, the one I find the least forgivable, absolutely the least, was the Wasim
    Akram one (and Waqar if he were involved; I personally was always more skeptical
    of his involvement).  This guy had glamor, endorsements, money, AND (unlike an
    aamer) appears to have come to match-fixing AFTER he attained all of those."

    to take a fair view, innocent until guilty and so on. But this is the Pakistan
    cricket team. The board is corrupt from top to bottom. Look at the latest from
    Yasir Hameed and how scared he now is and how he is trying to wriggle out of it.
    In a different world, this would have led to the board firing a few people, suspending
    some players and generally cleaning house. But the red death is already in the
    house. Cleaning up is not on their agenda...
