  content: "He's something, isn't he... now you can find his post-2003 collected works
    here:  http://nadeemfparacha.wordpress.com/  It's a shame the stuff
    he wrote for The News' Instep and Political Economy hasn't yet been collected...
    the early and mid-90's were by far his best years... the articles on music in
    Instep are better known, but he also had an article in Political Economy when
    his friend Shehzad Amjad used to edit that section... speaking of Shehzad Amjad,
    does anyone know what he is up to these days?"

  content: Thank god I live in a cave, bubble but then sometimes some one, from somewhere
    sends me something like this monabaker.com/quotes.htm and my heart starts jumping
    ropes like a three legged dog. Life is scary. I think I'm better off dead.

<p><a href="http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/in-paper-magazine/img/blow+daddy">NAKED LUNCH: Blow daddy</a> by Nadeem F. Paracha is exactly the scathingly brilliant satire that I needed this morning. You must read the whole thing. </p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, God. Son, go do your homework. What happened to that science project you were working on?<br />
It's almost complete.<br />
Good boy. What are you making?<br />
A bomb.<br />
What?!<br />
A bomb.<br />
I heard that! But why?<br />
Because I am a true Muslim who hates America.<br />
But only last week you wanted to go to Disney Land.<br />
That's different.<br />
How come?<br />
Mickey Mouse is Muslim.<br />
No, he isn't.<br />
Is so. He converted when he heard azaan on the moon.<br />
On the moon?<br />
Yes. Because the earth is flat and&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;<br />
What??<br />
The earth is&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;<br />
I heard that!<br />
Daddy, do you want to see my science project, or not?<br />
Gosh, that bomb? But your science teacher will fail you.<br />
No, she wont.<br />
Really?<br />
Yes. I plan to blow her up as well. </p></blockquote>
