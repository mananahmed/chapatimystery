  content: "The link didnt work, but I am sure you said good things! Did his 2012
    fantasies come up for discussion? I just saw a statement from a Pakistani Taliban
    spokesman who used that date (he said \"America wants to destabilize Pakistan
    so that they can steal our nuclear assets before 2012\"). So it seems that he
    has an audience in Waziristan. Which is one reason why I dont find his shenanigans
    harmless fun. I have no doubt that the army psyops people who started him off
    did not really want his nonsense to become a recruiting tool for the \"bad taliban\",
    but things have gone in that direction anyway.\r\nAnd yes, this army psyops statement
    itself sounds like a conspiracy theory, but if you know a lot of the people in
    the PKKH stable (Dan Qayyum, Ahmed Qureshi, Moin Ansari, Zaid Hamid, etc) you
    too will have to believe that the army had something to do with this nonsense."

    to hear a discussion on Zaid Hamid that didn't degenerate into shrill accusations.
    Any plans to tackle any other myths or myth peddlers in Pakistani history?"

  content: "Sepoy, I really enjoyed what you had to say here (and it made me miss
    having you to talk to in Chicago). That said, it reminded me of the way so many
    here (can't remember if you were among them) screamed bloody murder when I praised
    the work of foreign journalists and the NYT in particular in Pakistan. At that
    time, I was told about how vibrant the public sphere debate inside Pakistan was
    and how essentially sound were the middle classes. Here you seem to be saying
    that the middle classes, broadly defined, are precisely those attracted to an
    increasingly debased and demagogic political commentary. While, as the comparison
    with Glenn Beck implies, I don't think this peculiar to Pakistan, I do think the
    prevalence of shrill, far-right rhetoric is not, as you imply here, to be underestimated.
    \r\nEarlier in the year in Chicago Naim, Atiya, and I attended a roundtable of
    Pakistani journalists who were  traveling all over the country which turned out
    to be quite interesting. Basically one or two young journalists, who were anxious
    that the cameras be turned off as they spoke, were raising serious alarms about
    the sort of difficulty they faced in attempting to practice journalism in their
    native country - whether due to intimidation by outside forces or due to reactionary
    or simply philistine editors, etc. Others on the panel reacted very strongly to
    what these young journalists said. Recalling stories of bullying and murder, the
    younger ones stated outright that they envied the  security and editorial latitude
    that those attached to the foreign press enjoyed. They also lamented the decline
    of the mass circulation, left-wing or even liberal Urdu, Punjabi, etc. press for
    which many of them had hoped to write when they first entered the profession (many
    did not speak English well and addressed the Chicago audience through translators).\r\nSo,
    all of this is to ask, do you still agree with what you said before on this subject?"

  content: "Congratulations. That was an absolutely brilliant interview. Keep up the
    good work!\r\n\r\nI was recently pointed in Zaid Hamid's direction by several
    friends who mentioned that there was this mad man on Pak TV who was absolutely
    hilarious. And they were right. I watched a few of his rabble rousing sermons
    with the same kind of train-wreck curiosity which one feels towards Rush Limbaugh
    or Sean Hannity (or for that matter Rachel Maddow and Keith Olberman on the left
    side of the ideological divide). But on a serious note, I started thinking that
    this guy could be the next OBL. And if the general populace of Pak is so taken
    by his poisonous rhetoric, could Kristalnacht in Pak be too far away? Having met
    many many Pakistanis in the US- an overwhelming majority of whom are perfect gentlemen-
    I feel that fears of goose-stepping jackboots (sporting red fezes, in all probability)
    marching in Islamabad are unfounded. But never having been in Pakistan myself
    and based on the idiotic comments that have been posted in response to the interview,
    I am not so sure. What do you think?"

  content: "I miss you too Spencer. \r\n\r\nI don't recall screaming at you because
    NYT has a foreign reporting in Pakistan since that has very little to do with
    the diversity of media within Pakistan (presumably NYT Bureau in Paris exists
    independently of French media). So, let us leave that aside. \r\n\r\nYour larger
    question is really whether the media itself has grown conservative, whether Zaid
    Hamid is an aberration or a medium. I think certainly the progressive media from
    2007-8 is not with us. There are more conservative voices. There is more doom
    and gloom. Is it overwhelmingly so? I don't know enough to say. I still read progressive
    voices in mainstream Urdu papers. English newspapers have actually increased recently.
    And media watch-dog blogs are quite robust. It doesn't invalidate the comments
    made by the panelists you heard either - it remains a very populous country, the
    tv media remains the chief form of entertainment and news,  and that media is
    just as diverse as Glenn Beck or Glenn Greenwald here."

  content: "Off-topic: In the interests of \"balance\", one shouldn't create a false
    equivalence: I am not the biggest Keith Olberman fan, I don't like that style
    of punditry/shock jock TV \"journalism\", but there is no equivalence between
    him (let alone the more sober Maddow) and Hannity or, worst of all, Beck.  First,
    consider the partisanship: you WILL find Olberman and Maddow calling out (e.g.)
    the Obama Administration -- you never EVER saw that with the likes of Hannity
    when Bush was around.  Right-wing extremists they may be, but the greater goal
    -- advancing the electoral cause of the Republican party -- was never forgotten
    by them.  Whereas, be it on the BP oil spill, gay rights, etc., Maddow and Olberman
    have criticized the Obama Administration.  Second, I have not found the same sorts
    of instances of Olberman and Maddow blatantly lying the way one finds a Beck doing
    so.\r\n\r\nThis isn't about right vs. left: currently, in America, there is increasingly
    no serious popular right-wing discourse (the serious and sober ones are increasingly
    deciding to keep mum for partisan reasons), barring the odd David Brooks sort
    of columnist.  It points to a great impoverishment of popular political discourse
    in the country.  Positions that would have been considered crazy ten years ago
    are bandied about on mainstream fora.  And most of this is associated with the
    right; there are simply no mainstream/popular analogues on the left -- Maddow
    and Olberman's shrillness are a very far cry from this."

  content: "The comparison with France and the U.S. is spurious, imho. After all,
    journalists are not an endangered species in France or the U.S. Journalists don't
    need to ask that the cameras be turned off for them to speak their minds. Of course,
    the ideological question is different, namely why are people who enjoy rights
    afraid of freedom? and I see no reason to go into that here. What I would say
    is that I read the human rights reports on journalism in Pakistan and, to me,
    it is absolutely clear that, even more than in India, there flourishes a culture
    of fear and intimidation in Pakistan today. The issue of the NYT arises in a context
    where journalists are intimidated and require the protection of a prestigious
    international paper. Again, there is nothing comparable in France. Nor is it the
    case that young people in the U.S. are the fastest growing (or even a growing)
    right-wing demographic. Also, the mainstream American right is not about to undertake
    a violent, quasi-fascistic political project. It is not motivated by visceral
    racist hatreds of the sort Mr. Hamid seems inclined to stoke. That's not to say
    that they are not dangerous. They are and all the more because the political stakes
    for the world as a whole are so high. But, call me complacent, I don't believe
    that the U.S. is living through the end of the rule of law. The people of Pakistan
    have never known the rule of anything but despotism from the British on down.
    Of course, you were not positive as to your assessment as to just how widespread
    the right-wing turn is among young middle-class Pakistanis, so I should ask, \"just
    how widespread is the appeal of Zaid Hamid?\" \r\n@ Qalandar - I'm not sure what
    you are arguing. I'm not talking only about mainstream media. I'm also talking
    about intellectual journals, leftist papers, book publishing, etc. Obviously,
    when one starts talking about massive television media, etc., one is dealing with
    issues of monopoly, etc., and not just with questions of freedom, right, and the
    security to pursue same."

    from 1979 to 2001. Anyone writing against the jihadi operation did incur real
    risks. I know a lot of journalists and they all have stories of calls from the
    ISI and worse. Amir Mir had his car burned in front of his house by intelligence
    people in broad daylight. But after 2001 there was some loosening and in the last
    2-3 years its become more of a free for all. Many journalists have been killed
    in Pakhtunkhwa by the taliban and there are lingering suspicions that the jihadi
    wing of the ISI may have bumped off a couple of them, but in Punjab and Sindh
    the consensus has definitely cracked. \r\nOf course, the subject of religion continues
    to be censored by almost everyone. Even NFP writes from the point of view of modern
    progressive Islam, not un--Islam or anti-Islam."

    fear will have to be overcome. I suppose what I would want to emphasize is that
    the old (what I consider to be pseudo-left) concerns about \"orientalism\" and
    \"covering Islam\" (just to take the relevant book titles) are misplaced and grossly
    oversimplify what is in fact a very complex matter. I'm simply not sure that the
    NYT, CNN, or the BBC are really \"western\" in any fundamental sense. Rather,
    I think many Pakistanis look to these as important news sources, just as they
    look to \"Pakistani\" sources in both English and Urdu."

<p>Just wanted to note here that I taped a show with Worldview <a href="http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/content.aspx?audioID=43368">last week on Zaid Hamid</a>. Apparently it was posted on the official Syed Zaid Hamid facebook group which generated a lot of comments. Some of the wise ones went over to the CPR site as well, and left comments. I gathered some choice ones. Now you can enjoy too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usman // Sunday, July 25, 2010 @ 12:56 PM</p>
<p>Mr. Manan and respected Host, you can't even begin to perceive that being a patriotic Pakistani directly/indirectly links to the Islamic belief. Zaid Hamid's followers are the school/college/university students that aren't ignorant and have their own way of looking at things. You can not analyze current affairs happening in Pakistan while sitting out. Zionist Brahman Idiology is simply targeting the minorities in India which include and isn't limited to Muslims. Manan Sahab, you better be prepared next time before being a guest on a show as a &ldquo;historian&rdquo;. No illusions being drawn by Zaid Hamid.. you are just ignorant and are unable to view events on a larger scale. Our GOAL is the Re-establishment of Khilafah. Ahmadis have been declared non-Muslim by the fiqah and aren't even allowed to enter Mecca.<br />
--</p>
<p>u illiterate pathetic so called Pakistani historian. Im sure u wouldnt even know when did the Pakistan movement started</p>
<p>--<br />
this fake manan ahmed is infact india hindo, only acting as pakistani. chicago radio you should be ashmed of yourself.</p>
<p>--<br />
Mr. Mannan is a bad bad historian & even a worse "Analyst" of situation on ground in Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
