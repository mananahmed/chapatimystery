<p><img src="/img/usid.jpg" hspace=6 align=left height=100 border=1>Britain is rolling out the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3657619.stm">I.D. cards</a> in London. This is a voluntary trial but by 2012 it will be compulsary. Funnily enough, <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1202918,00.html">Muslim women will be exempt </a> from this trial presumably because it fringes on their religious practice to veil. Mind you, Britain is a police state already. There are cameras every 10 feet in london and I am sure the MI-5 learned a trick or two from the K.G.B.<br />
The backlash specifically <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/idcard/uk/id-terrorism.pdf">counters the claim</a> [pdf] that ID cards will deter terrorists (I have yet to hear about terrorists faking identities).<br />
I remember Dean taking all kinds of flack because he mentioned something about a National ID card. In Pakistan, we have had ID cards forever (as in most of Europe and Asia) and I know that my uncles had about 6 a piece - with different names and pictures. My uncles were no terrorists. They are not even shady. The multiple ID cards were used to get out of parking tickets and cast multiple votes in student elections in their college. Of course, that was long ago and the new <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/cnic.html">NID card in Pakistan </a> has some biometric (?) data and a spiffy website. So, presumably, that kind of abuse no longer takes place.<br />
I think that National ID card will debut very soon after the Bush re-election. Larry Ellison is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47788,00.html?tw=wn_story_related"> chomping at the bits </a> to put his Oracle db to the backend and have a national ID. Ashcroft, who hated the idea of gun owners having to register, is on board.<br />
My small contribution to this debate is to merge the CAPPS II rating system with the ID card. Look at your driver's license. On the front, it has a "class" listing which pertains to whether you use corrective lenses. That should be the terrorist rating you get from the CAPPS II. Help the police out. I am AAB, btw, which means I get checked manually on the terror list each time I board a plane. But I do NOT get body cavity search. WOO HOO.</p>
