  content: "super. did you guys get a chance to read 'the other column plus' by ejaz
    haider? it has to be the most 'uncensored' piece of writing to appear in papers
    post-emergency. here's one. enjoy!  Wednesday, November 07, 2007   the
    other column plus: Big Bro &amp; post-E+ reportage &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Ejaz Haider  
      FROM THE HIDEOUT OF MAULANA FAZLULLAH: Maulana Fazlullah, amir-ul momineen
    of the almost-liberated Islamic State of Swat, has said that following the November
    3 proclamation of Emergency-plus, he had decided to call off the armed insurgency
    against the state of Pakistan. The Maulana was speaking to the Daily Times correspondent
    from his hideout.  When he was asked why he would do so, given that he had
    virtual control of the area, Fazlullah said that he was not ashamed to confess
    that the proclamation \"hath cow'd my better part of man!\". \"Did you see him
    on television; did you not notice what resolve he showed? He was charged up and
    meant business,\" Fazlullah said to DT.  Fazlullah also said that his decision
    to lay down arms and go back to a peasant's life was strengthened when \"I saw
    the courageous Law Enforcement Agencies in action on the Mall in Lahore and other
    parts of Pakistan\".  \"You can't fight with someone like that. That man
    goes the whole hog. Plus, he has declared this Emergency because he wants to put
    down terrorism. And once he is done with the terrorists on the streets of Lahore
    and Karachi, he is definitely going to come after me. Before that happens, I am
    going to supplicate myself unto him.\"  APP adds: Maulana Fazlullah has
    called upon his cadres to lay down arms and immediately go back to normal life.
    He is also planning to send emissaries to the Presidency to sue for peace and
    is prepared to accept all terms unconditionally. He looked shaken and conceded
    that the decision had followed the imposition of martial law in the country and
    the ultimatum given to all and sundry to either shape up or ship out.  Sources
    near Murree Brewery say this development has vindicated the President's decision.
    They also said that this will have a domino effect and before long other terrorists
    will also follow suit.    Two days after this development:  FROM
    THE HIDEOUT OF BAITULLAH MEHSUD: Al Qaeda front-man and the Taliban commander
    in North Waziristan, Baitullah Mehsud, has announced that the 30,000 men under
    his control, including 3000 suicide bombers, have decided to stop fighting the
    security forces and are prepared to lay down their arms and seek the government's
    forgiveness.  The development, which took everyone by surprise, came about
    a week after Big Bro came on TV and announced a state of Emergency to root out
    terrorism. Mr Mehsud is blamed for multiple attacks on security forces in the
    area. His suicide bombers are also said to have mounted attacks across Pakistan
    on both soft and hard targets.  In a meeting with the Daily Times correspondent,
    Mr Mehsud said that the decision by Maulana Fazlullah in the Swat area to call
    off the insurgency had also demoralised his men.  But aren't the suicide
    bombers, by the very logic of suicide, afraid of nothing, he was asked. Mr Mehsud
    said that it was a subtle point and needed to be explained. \"See here, their
    fearlessness is a function of my motivation. It is an everyday job which I perform.
    The problem is that since that fateful November 3 night, I have been so scared
    of what might happen to me that it is impossible for me and my immediate commanders
    to give the bombers their daily ration of motivation,\" he told DT.  To
    a question about whether this will also impact the global jihad by Mr Osama bin
    Laden and his right-hand man, Dr Ayman 'Strangelove' al-Zwahiri, Mr Mehsud said
    that while the two gentlemen were still holding their ground, \"I am not sure
    how long they will last now that Big Bro has taken his gloves off\".  Mr
    Mehsud also said that he had sent emissaries to the Al Qaeda bosses to tell them
    that resistance was futile and they should throw in the towel. He explained that
    \"throwing in the towel\" was a figure of speech and should not be construed to
    mean that Mr bin Laden and Dr al-Zwahiri were enjoying such comforts of life as
    towels and napkins.  Stop Press: News has come in that all the protestors
    that were taken to safety in Lahore and other parts of the country after they
    decided to put themselves in harm's way have been allowed to go home after they
    admitted to acting like small children. One such protestor interviewed by the
    press said: \"Sometimes parents have to take strict measures for the welfare of
    their children. We chose to act like spoilt kids but have come round to appreciating
    the logic of why we needed to be grounded.\"    Other Political Stories:  LAHORE:
    Daily Times has learnt that the government of Pakistan has hired the services
    of Ms Paris Hilton to promote a soft image of Pakistan. Ms Hilton, who is known
    to Internet surfers around the world including in Pakistan, is a tall, statuesque
    blonde and is known for being a carefree spirit. She believes in Monsieur Jean-Jacques
    Rousseau's theory of the noble savage and has often gone beyond the call of duty
    to spread the message that the modern impediments of civilisation including such
    encumbrances as clothes fetter the human spirit.  While Monsieur Rousseau
    is reported to have famously said that \"man was born free but is in chains everywhere\",
    Ms Hilton's slogan is that man was also born naked but is in clothes everywhere.
    Hence the obvious need to free him/her of this irritability.  When DT contacted
    government sources to find out why Ms Hilton was hired to represent Pakistan,
    a highly placed official said that she was selected in keeping with the degree
    of internal freedom Pakistan enjoys. \"A free-for-all country must be represented
    by a free spirit,\" said the official.  While DT could not confirm this,
    rumour has it that Ms Hilton might be assisted by Ms Britney Spears after Ms Spears
    is released from rehab. Ms Spears is recently divorced, has put on weight and
    is known for going sans underwear.  Ejaz Haider is Op-Ed Editor of Daily
    Times and Consulting Editor of The Friday Times. He can be reached at sapper@dailytimes.com.pk"

    \ V interesting to see how the trends &amp; tactics of global activist movements
    from range of issue-areas are getting reworked &amp; applied here--from the snarky-ass
    signs to the spraypaint to the teenagers with taped mouths (the last of which
    being so often associated with \"pro-life\" crazies).  I'll be inducing
    somebody to translate that clip for me soon, btw.  Accessory to sedition! (We

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}/img/uploads/2007/11/gomusharraf.jpg' alt='gomusharraf.jpg' />The General's crackdown on media involves the key "code of conduct" which prohibits making fun of His Enlightened Excellency. It is a healthy decree - no society can survive if its Elders are Targeted by Base Humor. Perhaps it was after his trip to the <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115155&title=pervez-musharraf-pt.-2">Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a>, where he was treated with deference and respect, that He Who Is Pakistan decided that the Pakistanis need to grow up. </p>
<p>Sadly, kids at <i>4 Man Show</i> have not learned their lesson. In the guise of exaggerated humility and compliance, they continue to mock him. Ruthlessly. ("<i>Sab Theek Hai</i>. Everything is fine in Pakistan. I saw with my own eyes, the lion and the lamb drinking water from the pond outside. All is just fine in Pakistan. Diamonds are being sold on the street like peas.")<br />
