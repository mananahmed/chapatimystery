  content: "Excellent commentary, Sepoy, on the Youhana issue.  I am shocked by this
    news, it comes as a blow - an obvious win for bigoted, narrow-minded fundamentalist
    interests in a land where Sufis sang Kaafian of Divine Love, Guru Nanak was born,
    and Waris Shah wrote his epic &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&rdquo;Heer&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;.
    \ The Sufis and Sikh gurus stressed love for all humanity, the One-ness of God,
    and the importance of remembering the Creator.  It's unfortunate that Wahabbi
    elements will always infiltrate sections of Muslim society - and deviate from
    the true teachings of Islam.  Islam is about love, humanity and peace - not hate,
    bigotry and intolerance (as certain \"Muslims\" like to propogate).  \nIt's the
    in-human philosophy of hate and conversion by so called \"champions of Islam\"
    like Tabligh-i-Jamaat, that Islam is so misconstrued in the West.  \nThe sad thing
    is that this form of extremism and hate exists in the States too.  They're the
    right wing Christian conservatives who say, \"You'll burn in hell if you don't
    accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.\"\nExtremism and religious intolerance
    exists in all societies, and should be eradicated and frowned upon by all humans."

  content: "I don't know if Younis Khan replaced Youhana as vice-captain because Youhana
    was a Christian at the time or not. I do think it should be noted that Youhana,
    while captaining, looked lost in Australia. Younis, however, was a revelation
    when Inzamam was off the field in India. Younis used aggressive, creative field
    placings and he forced breakthroughs. \nImran Khan knows his cricket and he was
    right to argue that Younis should be VC over Youhana. I'm not convinced that religion
    was the main issue for that change. Could it be possible that the PCB actually
    just made a good selection decision for once?"

    Works both ways though doesn't it? Who are you, or Jiye, or myself to comment on -- and frankly belittle -- his conversion if it is a "private" matter? The liberal reponse to someone talking about religion publically seems a little hypocritical to me as it appears only a liberal may discuss religion openly.

    I have to admit that even as a "religious" person I am not particularly "evangelical" (it's simply not in my nature). People who try and shove their religiosity down my throat are met with a sharp rebuff, though I wouldn't deride someone for trying to "convert" me to their point of view. So what if Youhana found the arguments of Anwar (or whoever) persuasive (no matter how much one may scoff at the actual argument)? Afterall, isn't it a liberal idea to use persuasion through argumentation rather than violence? Was Youhana threatened with violence unless he converted? I don't know as I am not in Pakistan right now, so maybe someone could clear that up for me. In fact, people ought to be happy that these "fundies" actually spoke to Youhana in the first place, rather than dismiss him as a disbeliever already 'destined for hell'.

    And I don't think the Tablighis are much like the American Christian Right today as they're too apolitical for that. The mullahs will make political hay out of this just as much as secularists or liberals make hay out of other events which favour their viewpoint (I'm not favouring one over the other, merely questioning this "auto-liberal" response).

  content: I have heard a lot of people dismayed over this conversion, and I must
    say, it upsets me. Religion is supposed to be about finding what one believes
    to be the truth; some people I have heard have said that one who is a Pakistani
    Christian should remain a Pakistani Christian. Why? Why should religion be as
    fixed as ethnicity? Granted, I too, like Thabet, am no evangelical, nor am I exactly
    a fan of the Tablighi Jama'at (but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm opposed
    to them.) If a man makes an honest, searching decision regarding God, I must applaud
    that.

    I wonder if it is at all possible for a Pakistani Christian to convert to Islam without some part of him doing so in order to fit in... The country was created, after all, for the Muslims of the Subcontinent, implying that our non-Muslim compatriots weren't really full-fledged compatriots, just "protected" minorities... Theoretically guaranteed full freedom of religion, but never quite full Pakistanis, referred to as Chooras behind their backs...

    Wouldn't this situation be even worse for someone who spends most of the year touring with a team full of devout Muslims?

  content: "Thabet, your post reflects your unfortunate ignorance.   The fundamentalist
    Tablighis, who adopt a fanatic view of Islam (pretty much hating everything else),
    are only \"apolitical\" for 1) purposes of not being subjugated by the government,
    2) to infiltrate Lahore and Karachi and convert common people into Maulvis.   To
    say they are \"apolitical\" is simply not true.  They too, like the Christian
    conservatives in the US, are extremely 'right' leaning.  Every large organization
    in Pakistan (whether they claim to be apolitical or not) has an influence over
    how its members vote.  This is the way it works bro. Secondly, in order to
    support my claim of Tablighi's right wing bias, will you ever see people like
    Saeed Anwar campaigning for women's rights in Pakistan?  LOL.  Will you ever see
    their members talking about peace with India?  Will you ever see the Tablighi
    praise Musharaff's government or the US? Further, it IS DOCUMENTED that Tablighi
    members have links to Jamaat E Islami, and Sipah E Sabah, two notorious religious
    right wing outfits in Pakistan.  Maulana Fazlur Rehman, leader of the opposition,
    and a member of Jamaat E Islami, is also known to attend Tablighi meetings. Thabet,
    it doesn't matter if you don't believe in egalatarian principles.   It's ok if
    acceptance of others is not in your nature.  It's ok if you think everyone else's
    religious views are wrong except yours - but please don't try to imply that Tablighi
    has no political agenda, or doesn't support the fanatic conservative platform.

    Sorry old chap, Lahore Zindabad/TKoT, I really have no idea what, in the name of anything Good left on this earth, you're talking about. I never said anything about the Tablighis views on women/US/foreign affairs/Depeche Mode/David Beckham's hair cut. I never even mentioned anything about the "egalatarian (sic) principles". I was actually pointing out the problem with peolpe like you who merely wish to shut the views of others you may not like.

    Oh, and you've already failed Godwin's Law and so appear to have lost the argument anyway. Be a good boy and run along to Google and find out why.

    thabet: my response was conflicted for exactly the reason you stated. His conversion is a private matter and I am all for people finding their gods. Something I left out of the post was that I do have a personal history with Saeed Anwar, Youhana and others in the cricket team. I do have some insight and my own understanding of the religious turn. Be that as it may, my despair was with his subsequent statement and what I do believe will be massive amounts of political hay. It is not his faith that was my concern, it is the politics of faith in cricket [his or anyone else's]. Maybe I should have made that more explicit in my post.

    As for Tablighi-Jamaa't...a lot of people I know are in it, associated with it. Are they decent people? yes. Are they political? yes. Are they coercive? yes.

    remarks. As for your reference to Godwin's Law, and your assertion that I've
    lost the argument by comparing the Tablighi's Wahabbist philosophy to that of
    the Nazis, i'd like to point your attention to \"Quirk's Exception\" to Godwin's
    Law, which states that an \"intentional invocation of this so-called 'Nazi Clause'
    is ineffectual.\" Furthermore, \"my dear chap\", it appears you have misunderstood
    the very essence of Godwin's Law, so I refer you to the following Godwin's Law
    FAQ: <a href=\"http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/faqs/godwin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/faqs/godwin.html</a>
     The FAQ's introduction states, \"One of the most famous pieces of Usenet trivia
    out there is 'if you mention Hitler or Nazis in a post, you've automatically ended
    whatever discussion you were taking part in'.  Known as Godwin's Law, this rule

    But that's another matter. And sure it's bad form from me to intentionally invoke
    Godwin's Law. I put my hand up to that.  sepoy: Fine, you have an insiders
    knowledge I do not posses and so I submit to your better judgement on that matter.
    Let me correct/clarify myself then: in *my experiences* -- of having been taught
    Islamic practices by members of the Tablighi Jamat (not all who were Pakistani,
    mind) -- \"politics\" has been largely eschewed and shunned. In fact mentioning
    the word would have you chastised for \"being too concerned with worldly affairs\"
    and not too concerned with \"purifying\" oneself of \"bad traits\" like \"forgetting
    God\". Are they political because all people operate in a political world? Yes,
    of course. Are they a political party with ostensible political goals, like say
    Hizb al-Tahrir? No, or it is hard to make such a case. Are they coercive like
    any true believers, religious or secular? Yes, no doubt. That's a believers \"job\",
    I suppose. Coercion doesn't need violence. As for decency, being liberal etc.
    again I have not said they are -- or even aren't -- \"decent\" or \"liberal\"
    or whatever, nor that these are not worthy criticisms. I was pointing to something
    else altogether."

    Sepoy, I couldn't agree more. Cricket is a religion that needs no other. Come to think of it, it might just be the perfect religion. It has a ritualistic, mystic charm which often orbits around seemingly-ordinary objects that are elevated exclusively through the context in which they are put to use; a dense web of doctrine, initially impenetrable to outsiders but which believers are always all-too-happy to explain to potential converts; and a proud sense of its own history and great events that often focuses on the most evenly-matched sides. It's not afraid to ask the big questions, often retrosopectively. "How was that onnnne?" Not just this, but it also boasts a plethora of god-like figures who regularly turn out to be reassuringly flawed. This provides great grounding to believers.

    One thing you do occasionally hear is that Matt Hayden is a <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/ashes2005/story/0,15993,1526850,00.html" rel="nofollow">"devout christian"</a>, but then he also <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/tm_objectid=15677232&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=hayden-f-word-rant-at-kid-fan-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">swears at kids</a>. The only time he mentioned God during the Ashes to my knowledge was as the "only man" who has any control over the weather (after taking the light in the 5th Test). That's more than enough religion for one series.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/faithincricket.jpg">Recently, WaPo and NYT did pieces on the growing dominance of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/17/AR2005091701522_pf.html">Christian prayer in baseball</a>. Jesus is my designated hitter, indeed. I chuckled at the conflation of sports and religion in present day USA. Why can't the Americans keep their religion off the pitch? The overt religiosity has always grated me in, what I perceive to be, a denomination-free zone. After all, the Aussies and the English playing the Ashes didn't invoke Jesus. Even so, I admit that I was taken aback by own reaction to the news that the Vice Captain of Pakistani cricket team, <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/43650.html">Yousuf Youhana</a>, a Christian by birth, had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4260516.stm">converted to Islam</a> two years ago [He kept it a secret until now]. I still had the auto-liberal response of one's religious choice staying strictly in the private domain. But I also felt severely irritated and quite dismayed for the Christian community in Pakistan and the political hay that the mullahs will make of all this. Instrumental in his conversion was Saeed Anwar, a retired star batsman, who joined the Tabligh-i Jama'at in the mid-90s. Anwar is indeed a devout, compassionate and charismatic individual who has a level of personal influence over the post-92 youngsters [Inzammam etc.] that can only be matched by the cult of personality that once surrounded Imran Khan. So, I am sure that he did <a href="http://news.webindia123.com/news/showdetails.asp?id=117707&cat=Sports">play a part</a> in Youhana's conversion.</p>
<p>Was Youhana a role-model for christian kids in Pakistan? I don't know. The man has the straightest bat ever. He is a role-model for all cricketing kids, that's for sure. Now, after his conversion, he <a href="http://paktribune.com/news/index.php?id=119643">says</a>,<i> "If every non-Muslim settled in Pakistan has searched the light of Islam then surly Pakistan will completely turn into a pure Islamic State and no one will remain here as non-Muslim"</i>. So much for inter-faith dialogue, eh?   </p>
<p>One conversation rankles in my mind. I argued at a gathering on my last visit to Pakistan that Youhana should be made the team captain. I was roundly rejected on the grounds that Youhana was a Christian. I remember laughing at the "joke" only to realize that the room was dead serious. As some are already <a href="http://www.manoramaonline.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=manorama/MmArticle/CommonFullStory&cid=1127128716807&c=MmArticle&p=1002194839100&count=10&colid=1002258272827&channel=News">suggesting</a>, this conversion could pave the way for him. </p>
<p>To my mind, the beauty of cricket was that it was its own religion. Raised as a sunni, I played with many shi'as, a hindus, two christian and that rambunctious parsi kid. Our religious holidays served the sole purpose of holding a match. I went to their religious gatherings to talk their parents out of requiring their presence. The only gods we worshipped were the gods of luck, of rain, of timing, of vengeance and retribution on the other club. There is an amazing amount of faith in cricket, or any sport for that matter, but there never was a God in cricket.</p>
