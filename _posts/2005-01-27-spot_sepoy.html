    Are there any legal implications of this? Maybe you could squeeze some cash out of A9.

    Granted, they'd just take another photo and you'd be out your legal fees. Still, I wonder what the law says here.

    street cameras to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/21/national/21cameras.html?ex=1253419200&en=91f6419c966161e7&ei=5090&partner=techdirt\"

    I doubt A9 has anything to worry about.  I do hereby request an A9 tshirt for
    all of us, though. and welcome to all the kottkies."

    i agree this IS odd. similar to hacim - i thought  - i'll look at this guys picture and wham - its about a half block down from where my wifes booth is set up during the 57th street art fair.

    we've gotten pizza from that place. great bakery stuff further east on the block and a phenominal bookstore at the other end of the block. but of course amazon wouldn't appreciate THAT.  ;-)

    very odd.

  content: odd coincidence?  i haven't seen chicago in years.  but i did spend hours
    yesterday morning strolling around paris and marseilles, trapped by ming the mechanic's
    link to similar function in french yellow pages(http://www.pagesjaunes.fr/). anyway
    it's all too cool, maybe there'll be a photo-of-every- building-in-the-world map
    in my lifetime. well,  maybe not

  content: Here is my little story. I am a regular reader at both kottke and chapati
    mystery. First I was at kottke and I read this yellow page thing there then I
    came at Chapatimystery and read about his amazing coincidence then the other day
    I visited kottke and here was this link to chapatimystery. So I came back here
    and looked at the streets of Chicago to find Sepoy clan returning from lunch.

    they haven't stalked us out properly yet--most businesses had no photos.

  content: you also might want to check out the "a9local" tag on flickr [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/a9local/].
    It consists of a9 yellow pages shots of interesting people and "action shots"
    (skateboard tricks, etc). Maybe you will see someone you know. (I found my car)

<p><img src="/img/a9.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6><a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/05/01/7424.html">Kottke</a> had a link up this morning about amazon's new addition to their a9 engine - <a href="http://a9.com/-/company/YellowPages.jsp">Yellow Pages</a>. Intrigued, I clicked over. They display little pictures of the businesses in the search results. Massively cool. Their how-we-did-it <a href="http://static.a9.com/-/static/videos/yp/A9-yellow-pages-video-press-release-qt.mov">video</a> [qt] tells us that they mounted cameras on lots of SUVs and then drove around the major cities taking snaps. Amazing.</p>
<p>So, I entered a local pizza joint's name. Search came up with it along with a picture of the store front. I clicked on the "walk up and down the street" arrows to  see what else they had. And I keep clicking around the block when I see THE ENTIRE SEPOY HOUSEHOLD on amazon.com!! It must have been sometime in October and we seem to be returning from lunch. Maybe a sunday? How massively weird is that?!</p>
<p>I don't know about you but I am freaked out by the internets lately. </p>
<p><b>update</b>: first, welcome to kottke readers. second, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0003YB3JA/103-3848779-1107835?">here</a> is the search, with a bit of hesitation.</p>
