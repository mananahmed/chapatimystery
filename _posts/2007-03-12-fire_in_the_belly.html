  content: "That description of \"Taste of Cherry\" has got to be the only time in
    my life a one-sentence description has made me want to see a movie. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    blogging, I think we sit in an uncomfortable middle-ground between the big-name
    \"skyhook\" political/technical bloggers  and the LJ/MySpace/FanBoy bloggers.
    We're blogging <i>about</i> something, and like our publishing cycle, it takes
    more time and energy to produce product than in a lot of other fields. We have
    to be patient with ourselves, and we have to convince others to be patient with
    us."

  content: Tony Karon (www.tonykaron.org) is still terrific, if intermittent.  And
    the Go Fug Yourself girls also offer incisive critique.  Blogs Not Dead!

  content: "Manan-\r\nCM won meover, previously an avid blog-hater, with its incisive
    posts. Your cold sighs are scaring me. \r\n\r\nPS. I long for a good, long post
    on homistan; it seems like you have been preoccupied with other inconsequential
    matters, of late."

  content: 're: hoopoe''s request, I second and amend: how about a comment on the
    recent realpolitik essay in foreign affairs about the Taliban''s resurgence as
    an agreed upon outcome between neocons and the ISI, who, according to the article,
    use the Taliban as some sort of irregulars.'

    up. Synchoni-cities has become an extended diary on not life in New York.\r\nAmends
    to be made? I actually did see the war porn that is 300, in a theatre in Hotlanta.
    \  Perhaps I could write a few lines on snark?"

<p><img src="/images/bloggerborder.jpg">I admit that I find it extremely hard to post here. In general, for a variety of reasons, I have very little energy for anything.</p>
<p>Last night, I saw 300 - the war porn movie. Usually, I'd expect myself to post some snarky review talking about Xerxes the cuban transsexual. Or at least some comment about history as particular form of jingoistic myth-making. But I really don't want to... or perhaps this is all the comment that movie deserves.</p>
<p>I have noticed that people I used to read 2 years ago, have all departed. Or gone largely silent. To my detriment, I have not found new writers. What gives? Is blogging over, folks? And I just didn't get the memo? Maybe, I can turn to the confessional? Except, I hate talking about myself - yes, even in real life.   </p>
<p>Oh, that NYer cartoon is <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/product_details.asp?mscssid=THVAQLC0307H9P1GNW2415P9EURH3EFA&sitetype=1&did=4&sid=123677&pid=&keyword=blog&section=all&title=undefined&whichpage=4&sortBy=popular">funny</a>. </p>
