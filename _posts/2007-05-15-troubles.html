  content: "something like:\r\n\r\n<b>Their Blood is on Whose Neck?</b> [colloquially,
    that would be \"Hands\"]\r\n\r\nKarachi was drenched in blood, Why?\r\nDaughters
    were robbed of their husbands, Why?\r\nHowever many children were orphaned, Why?\r\nHow
    many Mothers will await those sons who will never return, Why?\r\nHow many flames
    were extinguisghed in kitchens? Why?\r\nThese were martyrs neither for Justice
    nor the Court\r\nThey were sacrificed only for someone's ego,\r\n\r\nThese widows,
    these orphans and these mothers ask\r\nHow long will Politics be played for the
    sake of Justice?\r\nFor the sake of God, please stop .... Or the People will Stop
    You.\r\n\r\nSigned: Truth Seeking People."

  content: "Want to see the irony in that ad...\r\nTruth seeking people (Haq parast
    awam) is actually MQM. They call themself Haq Parast Obviusly shame is yet another
    basic element of humanity that they are devoid of."

<p><img src='{{site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2007/05/khon.jpg' alt='khon.jpg' width='180'/>"Karachi is smelling quite similar to early 90s." My dear friend, who lives and works in Karachi, responded thusly to my query about his safety. For everyone's sake, I pray <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/yearwise_detail_mqm.htm">not</a>.</p>
<p>I saw this ad in <i>Daily Jang</i> the day after the massacres. I don't know who sponsored it - but the language makes me think it is not someone very sympathetic to the CJ. But, one could easily ask the same questions from The General.</p>
<p>The news is <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/15/top3.htm">bad</a> and it gets worse. Another <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/world/asia/15cnd-pakista.html?ex=1336881600&en=ffeb5359bf44d244&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">22 were killed</a> in another suicide attack in Peshawar. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_05/011303.php">pundits</a> here are wrangling their hands as usual - what do we do? If we don't support the General, the ISI will get the nukes! or the Islamists will get the nukes. Let me blow your mind, folks, the ISI always had the Islamists and the ISI was always in charge of the nuclear program. Go figure. </p>
<p>I wanted to write a longer piece but I am, literally, too depressed. </p>
