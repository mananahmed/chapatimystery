  content: "I have read out loud five of the Lemony Snicket series to my seven-year-old.
    \ And I have enjoyed it because an authorial voice or \"story-teller\" is part
    of the book and therefore, makes the book a little bit about the art of narrative.
    \ For one, the narrator kills the big suspense -- will it end happily or not?
    -- by telling us that it will end badly.  For two, there are enough times when
    the author interrupts the plot (to define a word, to relate a sad story from his
    own \"life,\" to caution the reader about getting too hopeful that things will
    end well) to simulate an oral story-telling experience.  Which is what my daughter
    is getting when I read to her. So, the net result is thinking about story as a
    construction of some other mind, not something  that is \"true.\"  \nAnyway, this
    series hooked her and made her think that reading might be an enjoyable pasttime.
    \ And, even though these books are above her reading fluency level, she has just
    finished reading the first book on her own (without any encouragement from me).\n\nGo
    David Handler (aka Lemony Snicket).  There must be other good writers of children's
    fiction out there."

    "Any of you have a recommendation for an incredibly literate 10 year old?"

    Mark Twain's "The Innocents Abroad"

    Fitzgerald's Gatsby and then Gordon Korman's retelling "Jake, Reinvented"

    Or you could just ask Brad DeLong to send you the books his kids finish reading.

    Watch out for the books I read when I was too young to understand them (homepage link).

    I'm not sure if it's entirely 10-year old material, but Robert Heinlein's juvenalia is quite fun ("Have Space Suit, Will Travel" or "the Rolling Stones" for example.

    Lloyd Alexander's Prydain stuff is probably more 13-year old material, as is LeGuin's Earthsea, and McCaffrey's Dragonriders is really older still. that's not helping....

    My nieces have really enjoyed the "Magic Treehouse" series, which takes students into historical episodes (and there are now companion volumes explaining the historical background in depth).

    Sumana: Innocents Abroad is great. And, can we do a survey of how many desi kids read Art Buchwald because their fathers had that? You are the fourth person so far - including me.

    Jonathan: The Magic Treehouse series sounds really interesting. Reminds me of Enid Blyton's magic tree...anyone read her anymore?

    Sepoy,

    When I was ten years old, I used to love this Indian comic book series called Amar Chitra Katha. They now have an <a href="http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/" rel="nofollow">online store</a>.

  content: "Madeleine L'Engle works, as do Ursula LeGuin, and (of course) Neil Gaiman
    (I'd suggest \"Stardust\", and \"Coraline\").  Personally, I was reading PG Wodehouse
    and John Irving when I was 9, and loving them, so my opinions may be semi-skewed.
    \ \n\nAnd Terry Pratchett's not so bad either ;) Try \"Good Omens\", or one of
    the more light-hearted Discworld novels (\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated
    Rodents\" comes to mind)."

    Hi Sepoy

    I really enjoyed your Berkeley SAC paper. Couldn't get to meet you, so was googling you :) and stumbled on this fascinating blog. Have been lost in it ever since. Great posts. May you get all your wishes- including that tenured job.


    As the father of a fairly literate eight year old- who is just gotten hooked on to Lemony Snickett- I fully second all of the above suggestions.

    I have found these websites useful in hunting down  books with my kid (usually at the local public library)



    www.kidsread.com

    Cheers,

    Dhananjay

<p><img src="/images/lemony.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>I have not read any of the <i>Series of Unfortunate Events</i> books but there are certain members in the sepoy household that hold them very near and dear. I have been toiling away in hopes to buy winter solstice presents for those individuals and not having much luck. Graphic novels? Why can't Neil Gaiman be more productive, huh? Any of you have a recommendation for an incredibly literate 10 year old? </p>
<p>Anyways, during my "research", I came across an interview with Lemony Snicket, the author of the Series books, in the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/story.jsp?story=593078">Independent</a>. A very nice answer:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif">Q: Are your stories based on real-life things?<br />
Matthew Shuttleworth, aged 10, by e-mail</p>
<p>A: All stories are based on two things: real-life things, and other stories, but these "other stories", of course, are also based on the same two things - real-life things or other stories, and these "other stories" are also based on the same two things, and so on, and so on, and this complicated arrangement is further complicated by the tendency for real-life things to become stories as time passes, and the difference between real-life things and stories becomes complicated, so real-life things tend to get lost inside stories that are based on real-life things and on other stories, or perhaps it's the other way round, with stories based on real-life things and other stories getting lost inside real-life things, which might explain why, in real life, we often feel so very lost that even answering a simple question becomes so exhausting and confusing that we want to lie down with our eyes closed and listen closely to the string quartets of Dmitri Shostakovich and certain 12-in singles by New Order. <img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>That about sums it up, don't it? </p>
<p><b>update:</b>Woh! This is entry # 250 at the CM. That sounds like a milestone to me. Or at least the half way point. How long is one supposed to blog? 1 year sound about right? 500 entries sound better. That could be the published book: <i>500 Things I Had To Say When I Should Have Been Working On The Dissertation And Now I Adjunct At The Naval Academy.</i> Hmmm..., quickly, I nominate <a href="/archives/univercity/parasika_or_how_to_waste_time.html">this</a> as my favorite post out of 250 because it captures so brilliantly what goes around at CM day in, day out.</p>
