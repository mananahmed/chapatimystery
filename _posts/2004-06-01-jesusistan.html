    sure, nothing is new in the South.
    But, my "new" denotes the elevated status of the state flag after the confederate flag came down.

<p><img src="/img/scar.gif" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Ed, a dear friend, is moving to South Carolina soon. He claims that it is the "New South". As proof, he pointed to the existence of some random mosque and the fact that the <s>new</s> S. Carolina <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/confederate4.html">flag</a> has a crescent on it! uh...sure ... but the crescent is pointing the wrong way. So, anyways, a week or so ago, I found this weird article about a <a href="http://christianexodus.org ">Christian fundi group</a> that wants to migrate good, solid Christian folk to South Carolina and then <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38571">secede</a> from the US - hoping that it will work for them: </p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">Christian Exodus is leading the charge for a peaceful secession of one state from the union, and after originally considering Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina due to their relatively small populations, coastal access, and the Christian nature of the electorate, Burnell says South Carolina has been selected as the target location. The plan initially calls for at least 12,000 Christians willing to be active in political campaigns to move to the Palmetto State. If all goes according to plan, they are hoping to have a constitutional convention by 2014, with a president of the new nation &acirc;&permil;&nbsp; still to be known as South Carolina &acirc;&permil;&nbsp; elected in 2016, which is also a presidential election year in the U.S. He says the nation would be founded on Christian principles, and the people writing its constitution would have to hash out details to safeguard it as a Christian republic.<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>Presumably, all this because gays are getting married or something. I just laughed and passed it on in an email to Ed. Today, I came across a follow-up <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38679">article</a>, that exclaims that the response to this publicity has been phenomenal:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">"It's unleashed a barrage," said Cory Burnell, president of Texas-based ChristianExodus.org. "It's been an incredible response, it's nothing I'm used to and is fairly gut-wrenching for me."... Asked by Sean Hannity about forces which might try to stop the secession if the movement sees success, Burnell responded, "We're receiving e-mails from liberals around the country who can't wait to get rid of us, so there's a benefit to everyone here."<img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>.</p>
<p>hey! maybe they can then elect GWB as <i>their</i> President in 2016. I shall continue to staunchly refuse to visit Ed in them thar hills. You hear me, Ed?</p>
<p><b>updated Nov 9th, 2004</b>: So, the call for secession is getting <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=5652"> serious</a> in the aftermath of the election. Can it <a href="http://www.fuckthesouth.com">work</a>?<br />
